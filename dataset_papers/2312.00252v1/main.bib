abstract = {The mapping of images onto surfaces may substantially increase the realism and information content of computer-generated imagery. The projection of a flat source image onto a curved surface may involve sampling difficulties, however, which are compounded as the view of the surface changes. As the projected scale of the surface increases, interpolation between the original samples of the source image is necessary; as the scale is reduced, approximation of multiple samples in the source is required. Thus a constantly changing sampling window of view-dependent shape must traverse the source image.To reduce the computation implied by these requirements, a set of prefiltered source images may be created. This approach can be applied to particular advantage in animation, where a large number of frames using the same source image must be generated. This paper advances a “pyramidal parametric” prefiltering and sampling geometry which minimizes aliasing effects and assures continuity within and between target images.Although the mapping of texture onto surfaces is an excellent example of the process and provided the original motivation for its development, pyramidal parametric data structures admit of wider application. The aliasing of not only surface texture, but also highlights and even the surface representations themselves, may be minimized by pyramidal parametric means.},
