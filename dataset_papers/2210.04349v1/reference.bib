Most variants identified so far confer relatively small increments in risk, and explain only a small proportion of familial clustering, leading many to question how the remaining, âmissingâ heritability can be explained. Here we examine potential sources of missing heritability and propose research strategies, including and extending beyond current genome-wide association approaches, to illuminate the genetics of complex diseases and enhance its potential to enable effective disease prevention or treatment.},

	abstract = {We introduce a principal support vector machine (PSVM) approach that can be used for both linear and nonlinear sufficient dimension reduction. The basic idea is to divide the response variables into slices and use a modified form of support vector machine to find the optimal hyperplanes that separate them. These optimal hyperplanes are then aligned by the principal components of their normal vectors. It is proved that the aligned normal vectors provide an unbiased, ân-consistent, and asymptotically normal estimator of the sufficient dimension reduction space. The method is then generalized to nonlinear sufficient dimension reduction using the reproducing kernel Hilbert space. In that context, the aligned normal vectors become functions and it is proved that they are unbiased in the sense that they are functions of the true nonlinear sufficient predictors. We compare PSVM with other sufficient dimension reduction methods by simulation and in real data analysis, and through both comparisons firmly establish its practical advantages.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in molecular genetic techniques will make dense marker maps available and genotyping many individuals for these markers feasible. Here we attempted to estimate the effects of approximately 50,000 marker haplotypes simultaneously from a limited number of phenotypic records. A genome of 1000 cM was simulated with a marker spacing of 1 cM. The markers surrounding every 1-cM region were combined into marker haplotypes. Due to finite population size N(e) = 100, the marker haplotypes were in linkage disequilibrium with the QTL located between the markers. Using least squares, all haplotype effects could not be estimated simultaneously. When only the biggest effects were included, they were overestimated and the accuracy of predicting genetic values of the offspring of the recorded animals was only 0.32. Best linear unbiased prediction of haplotype effects assumed equal variances associated to each 1-cM chromosomal segment, which yielded an accuracy of 0.73, although this assumption was far from true. Bayesian methods that assumed a prior distribution of the variance associated with each chromosome segment increased this accuracy to 0.85, even when the prior was not correct. It was concluded that selection on genetic values predicted from markers could substantially increase the rate of genetic gain in animals and plants, especially if combined with reproductive techniques to shorten the generation interval.},
