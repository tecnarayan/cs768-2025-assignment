@article{Lankarany:2019pb,
	Abstract = {Multiplexing refers to the simultaneous encoding of two or more signals. Neurons have been shown to multiplex, but different stimuli require different multiplexing strategies. Whereas the frequency and amplitude of periodic stimuli can be encoded by the timing and rate of the same spikes, natural scenes, which comprise areas over which intensity varies gradually and sparse edges where intensity changes abruptly, require a different multiplexing strategy. Recording in vivo from neurons in primary somatosensory cortex during tactile stimulation, we found that stimulus onset and offset (edges) evoked highly synchronized spiking, whereas other spikes in the same neurons occurred asynchronously. Stimulus intensity modulated the rate of asynchronous spiking, but did not affect the timing of synchronous spikes. From this, we hypothesized that spikes driven by high- and low-contrast stimulus features can be distinguished on the basis of their synchronization, and that differentially synchronized spiking can thus be used to form multiplexed representations. Applying a Bayesian decoding method, we verified that information about high- and low-contrast features can be recovered from an ensemble of model neurons receiving common input. Equally good decoding was achieved by distinguishing synchronous from asynchronous spikes and applying reverse correlation methods separately to each spike type. This result, which we verified with patch clamp recordings in vitro, demonstrates that neurons receiving common input can use the rate of asynchronous spiking to encode the intensity of low-contrast features while using the timing of synchronous spikes to encode the occurrence of high-contrast features. We refer to this strategy as synchrony-division multiplexing.},

@article{Richards:2019bh,
	Abstract = {Systems neuroscience seeks explanations for how the brain implements a wide variety of perceptual, cognitive and motor tasks. Conversely, artificial intelligence attempts to design computational systems based on the tasks they will have to solve. In artificial neural networks, the three components specified by design are the objective functions, the learning rules and the architectures. With the growing success of deep learning, which utilizes brain-inspired architectures, these three designed components have increasingly become central to how we model, engineer and optimize complex artificial learning systems. Here we argue that a greater focus on these components would also benefit systems neuroscience. We give examples of how this optimization-based framework can drive theoretical and experimental progress in neuroscience. We contend that this principled perspective on systems neuroscience will help to generate more rapid progress.},

@article{Panzeri:2010fk,
	Abstract = {Determining how neuronal activity represents sensory information is central for understanding perception. Recent work shows that neural responses at different timescales can encode different stimulus attributes, resulting in a temporal multiplexing of sensory information. Multiplexing increases the encoding capacity of neural responses, enables disambiguation of stimuli that cannot be discriminated at a single response timescale, and makes sensory representations stable to the presence of variability in the sensory world. Thus, as we discuss here, temporal multiplexing could be a key strategy used by the brain to form an information-rich and stable representation of the environment.},

@article{Chechik:2006qr,
	Abstract = {Information processing by a sensory system is reflected in the changes in stimulus representation along its successive processing stages. We measured information content and stimulus-induced redundancy in the neural responses to a set of natural sounds in three successive stations of the auditory pathway-inferior colliculus (IC), auditory thalamus (MGB), and primary auditory cortex (A1). Information about stimulus identity was somewhat reduced in single A1 and MGB neurons relative to single IC neurons, when information is measured using spike counts, latency, or temporal spiking patterns. However, most of this difference was due to differences in firing rates. On the other hand, IC neurons were substantially more redundant than A1 and MGB neurons. IC redundancy was largely related to frequency selectivity. Redundancy reduction may be a generic organization principle of neural systems, allowing for easier readout of the identity of complex stimuli in A1 relative to IC.},
