(2018) introduced a new task of commonsense natural language inference: given an event description such as {``}A woman sits at a piano,{''} a machine must select the most likely followup: {``}She sets her fingers on the keys.{''} With the introduction of BERT, near human-level performance was reached. Does this mean that machines can perform human level commonsense inference? In this paper, we show that commonsense inference still proves difficult for even state-of-the-art models, by presenting HellaSwag, a new challenge dataset. Though its questions are trivial for humans ({\textgreater}95{\%} accuracy), state-of-the-art models struggle ({\textless}48{\%}). We achieve this via Adversarial Filtering (AF), a data collection paradigm wherein a series of discriminators iteratively select an adversarial set of machine-generated wrong answers. AF proves to be surprisingly robust. The key insight is to scale up the length and complexity of the dataset examples towards a critical {`}Goldilocks{'} zone wherein generated text is ridiculous to humans, yet often misclassified by state-of-the-art models. Our construction of HellaSwag, and its resulting difficulty, sheds light on the inner workings of deep pretrained models. More broadly, it suggests a new path forward for NLP research, in which benchmarks co-evolve with the evolving state-of-the-art in an adversarial way, so as to present ever-harder challenges.",

We introduce the Optimal BERT Surgeon (oBERT), an efficient and accurate pruning method based on approximate second-order information, which we show to yield state-of-the-art results in both stages of language tasks: pre-training and fine-tuning. Specifically, oBERT extends existing work on second-order pruning by allowing for pruning weight blocks, and is the first such method that is applicable at BERT scale. Second, we investigate compounding compression approaches to obtain highly compressed but accurate models for deployment on edge devices. These models significantly push boundaries of the current state-of-the-art sparse BERT models with respect to all metrics: model size, inference speed and task accuracy. For example, relative to the dense BERT-base, we obtain 10x model size compression with {\textless} 1{\%} accuracy drop, 10x CPU-inference speedup with {\textless} 2{\%} accuracy drop, and 29x CPU-inference speedup with {\textless} 7.5{\%} accuracy drop.

However, their demanding computational and memory needs pose obstacles for broad use on edge devices. Quantization is then introduced to boost LLMsâ€™ on-device efficiency. Recent works show that 8-bit or lower weight quantization is feasible with minimal impact on end-to-end task performance, while the activation is still not quantized. On the other hand, mainstream commodity edge devices still struggle to execute these sub-8-bit quantized networks effectively. In this paper, we propose Agile-Quant, an Activation-Guided quantization framework for faster Inference of popular Large Language Models (LLMs) on the Edge. Considering the hardware profiling and activation analysis, we first introduce a basic activation quantization strategy to balance the trade-off of task performance and real inference speed. Then we leverage the activation-aware token pruning technique to reduce the outliers and the adverse impact on attentivity. Ultimately, we utilize the SIMD-based 4-bit multiplier and our efficient TRIP matrix multiplication to implement the accelerator for LLMs on the edge. We apply our framework on different scales of LLMs including LLaMA, OPT, and BLOOM with 4-bit or 8-bit for the activation and 4-bit for the weight quantization. Experiments show that Agile-Quant achieves simultaneous quantization of model weights and activations while maintaining task performance comparable to existing weight-only quantization methods. Moreover, in the 8- and 4-bit scenario, Agile-Quant achieves an on-device speedup of up to 2.55x compared to its FP16 counterparts across multiple edge devices, marking a pioneering advancement in this domain.}, number={17}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, author={Shen, Xuan and Dong, Peiyan and Lu, Lei and Kong, Zhenglun and Li, Zhengang and Lin, Ming and Wu, Chao and Wang, Yanzhi}, year={2024}, month={Mar.}, pages={18944-18951} }

Although widely used, this objective by design assumes that all the dimensions of hidden representations are independent, failing to capture important structural knowledge in the intermediate layers of the teacher network. To achieve better distillation efficacy, we propose Contrastive Distillation on Intermediate Representations (CoDIR), a principled knowledge distillation framework where the student is trained to distill knowledge through intermediate layers of the teacher via a contrastive objective. By learning to distinguish positive sample from a large set of negative samples, CoDIR facilitates the student{'}s exploitation of rich information in teacher{'}s hidden layers. CoDIR can be readily applied to compress large-scale language models in both pre-training and finetuning stages, and achieves superb performance on the GLUE benchmark, outperforming state-of-the-art compression methods.",

    abstract = "Pre-trained language models have been applied to various NLP tasks with considerable performance gains. However, the large model sizes, together with the long inference time, limit the deployment of such models in real-time applications. One line of model compression approaches considers knowledge distillation to distill large teacher models into small student models. Most of these studies focus on single-domain only, which ignores the transferable knowledge from other domains. We notice that training a teacher with transferable knowledge digested across domains can achieve better generalization capability to help knowledge distillation. Hence we propose a Meta-Knowledge Distillation (Meta-KD) framework to build a meta-teacher model that captures transferable knowledge across domains and passes such knowledge to students. Specifically, we explicitly force the meta-teacher to capture transferable knowledge at both instance-level and feature-level from multiple domains, and then propose a meta-distillation algorithm to learn single-domain student models with guidance from the meta-teacher. Experiments on public multi-domain NLP tasks show the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed Meta-KD framework. Further, we also demonstrate the capability of Meta-KD in the settings where the training data is scarce.",

  abstract = 	 {Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) are commonly developed at a fixed resource budget, and then scaled up for better accuracy if more resources are given. In this paper, we systematically study model scaling and identify that carefully balancing network depth, width, and resolution can lead to better performance. Based on this observation, we propose a new scaling method that uniformly scales all dimensions of depth/width/resolution using a simple yet highly effective compound coefficient. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on MobileNets and ResNet. To go even further, we use neural architecture search to design a new baseline network and scale it up to obtain a family of models, called EfficientNets, which achieve much better accuracy and efficiency than previous ConvNets. In particular, our EfficientNet-B7 achieves stateof-the-art 84.4% top-1 / 97.1% top-5 accuracy on ImageNet, while being 8.4x smaller and 6.1x faster on inference than the best existing ConvNet (Huang et al., 2018). Our EfficientNets also transfer well and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on CIFAR-100 (91.7%), Flower (98.8%), and 3 other transfer learning datasets, with an order of magnitude fewer parameters.}

    abstract = "We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5 (7.7 point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7{\%} (4.6{\%} absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).",

    abstract = "We present a new kind of question answering dataset, OpenBookQA, modeled after open book exams for assessing human understanding of a subject. The open book that comes with our questions is a set of 1326 elementary level science facts. Roughly 6000 questions probe an understanding of these facts and their application to novel situations. This requires combining an open book fact (e.g., metals conduct electricity) with broad common knowledge (e.g., a suit of armor is made of metal) obtained from other sources. While existing QA datasets over documents or knowledge bases, being generally self-contained, focus on linguistic understanding, OpenBookQA probes a deeper understanding of both the topic{---}in the context of common knowledge{---}and the language it is expressed in. Human performance on OpenBookQA is close to 92{\%}, but many state-of-the-art pre-trained QA methods perform surprisingly poorly, worse than several simple neural baselines we develop. Our oracle experiments designed to circumvent the knowledge retrieval bottleneck demonstrate the value of both the open book and additional facts. We leave it as a challenge to solve the retrieval problem in this multi-hop setting and to close the large gap to human performance.",

abstract = {The research in real-time segmentation mainly focuses on desktop GPUs. However, autonomous driving and many other applications rely on real-time segmentation on the edge, and current arts are far from the goal. In addition, recent advances in vision transformers also inspire us to re-design the network architecture for dense prediction task. In this work, we propose to combine the self attention block with lightweight convolutions to form new building blocks, and employ latency constraints to search an efficient sub-network. We train an MLP latency model based on generated architecture configurations and their latency measured on mobile devices, so that we can predict the latency of subnets during search phase. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to achieve over 74\% mIoU on Cityscapes with semi-real-time inference (over 15 FPS) on mobile GPU from an off-the-shelf phone.},
