One-bit compressed sensing (1bCS) is a method of signal acquisition under
extreme measurement quantization that gives important insights on the limits of
signal compression and analog-to-digital conversion. The setting is also
equivalent to the problem of learning a sparse hyperplane-classifier. In this
paper, we propose a novel approach for signal recovery in nonadaptive 1bCS that
matches the sample complexity of the current best methods. We construct 1bCS
matrices that are universal - i.e. work for all signals under a model - and at
the same time recover very general random sparse signals with high probability.
In our approach, we divide the set of samples (measurements) into two parts,
and use the first part to recover the superset of the support of a sparse
vector. The second set of measurements is then used to approximate the signal
within the superset. While support recovery in 1bCS is well-studied, recovery
of superset of the support requires fewer samples, and to our knowledge has not
been previously considered for the purpose of approximate recovery of signals.
