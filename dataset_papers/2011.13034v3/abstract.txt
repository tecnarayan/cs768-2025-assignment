In this paper we consider multi-objective reinforcement learning where the
objectives are balanced using preferences. In practice, the preferences are
often given in an adversarial manner, e.g., customers can be picky in many
applications. We formalize this problem as an episodic learning problem on a
Markov decision process, where transitions are unknown and a reward function is
the inner product of a preference vector with pre-specified multi-objective
reward functions. We consider two settings. In the online setting, the agent
receives a (adversarial) preference every episode and proposes policies to
interact with the environment. We provide a model-based algorithm that achieves
a nearly minimax optimal regret bound
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\bigl(\sqrt{\min\{d,S\}\cdot H^2 SAK}\bigr)$, where $d$
is the number of objectives, $S$ is the number of states, $A$ is the number of
actions, $H$ is the length of the horizon, and $K$ is the number of episodes.
Furthermore, we consider preference-free exploration, i.e., the agent first
interacts with the environment without specifying any preference and then is
able to accommodate arbitrary preference vector up to $\epsilon$ error. Our
proposed algorithm is provably efficient with a nearly optimal trajectory
complexity $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\bigl({\min\{d,S\}\cdot H^3
SA}/{\epsilon^2}\bigr)$. This result partly resolves an open problem raised by
\citet{jin2020reward}.
