  abstract = 	 {In this paper we introduce DeepCrawl, a fully-playable Roguelike
	prototype for iOS and Android in which all agents are controlled by
	policy networks trained using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Our
	aim is to understand whether recent advances in DRL can be used to
	develop convincing behavioral models for non-player characters in
	videogames. We begin with an analysis of requirements that such an
	AI system should satisfy in order to be practically applicable in
	video game development, and identify the elements of the DRL model
	used in the DeepCrawl prototype. The successes and limitations of
	DeepCrawl are documented through a series of playability tests
	performed on the final game. We believe that the techniques we
	propose offer insight into innovative new avenues for the
	development of behaviors for non-player characters in video games,
	as they offer the potential to overcome critical issues with
	classical approaches.}
