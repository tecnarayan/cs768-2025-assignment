abstract = {The goal of metalearning is to generate useful shifts of inductive bias by adapting
the current learning strategy in a ``useful'''' way. Our learner leads a single life
during which actions are continually executed according to the system''s internal
state and current {em policy} (a modifiable, probabilistic algorithm mapping environmental
inputs and internal states to outputs and new internal states). An action is considered
a learning algorithm if it can modify the policy. Effects of learning processes on
later learning processes are measured using reward/time ratios. Occasional backtracking
enforces success histories of still valid policy modifications corresponding to histories
of lifelong reward accelerations. The principle allows for plugging in a wide variety
of learning algorithms. In particular, it allows for embedding the learner''s policy
modification strategy within the policy itself (self-reference). To demonstrate the
principle''s feasibility in cases where conventional reinforcement learning fails,
we test it in complex, non-Markovian, changing environments (``POMDPs''''). One of
the tasks involves more than $10^{13}$ states, two learners that both cooperate and
compete, and strongly delayed reinforcement signals (initially separated by more than
300,000 time steps).}

in Automated Machine Learning (AutoML), collects descriptions of existing systems
based on these methods, and discusses the first series of international challenges
of AutoML systems. The recent success of commercial ML applications and the rapid
growth of the field has created a high demand for off-the-shelf ML methods that can
be used easily and without expert knowledge. However, many of the recent machine learning
successes crucially rely on human experts, who manually select appropriate ML architectures
(deep learning architectures or more traditional ML workflows) and their hyperparameters.
To overcome this problem, the field of AutoML targets a progressive automation of
machine learning, based on principles from optimization and machine learning itself.
This book serves as a point of entry into this quickly-developing field for researchers
and advanced students alike, as well as providing a reference for practitioners aiming

The goal of meta-learning is to train a model on a variety of learning tasks, such that it can solve new learning tasks using only a small number of training samples. In our approach, the parameters of the model are explicitly trained such that a small number of gradient steps with a small amount of training data from a new task will produce good generalization performance on that task. In effect, our method trains the model to be easy to fine-tune. We demonstrate that this approach leads to state-of-the-art performance on two few-shot image classification benchmarks, produces good results on few-shot regression, and accelerates fine-tuning for policy gradient reinforcement learning with neural network policies.}

abstract = {Meta-learning for few-shot learning entails acquiring a prior over previous tasks
and experiences, such that new tasks be learned from small amounts of data. However,
a critical challenge in few-shot learning is task ambiguity: even when a powerful
prior can be meta-learned from a large number of prior tasks, a small dataset for
a new task can simply be too ambiguous to acquire a single model (e.g., a classifier)
for that task that is accurate. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic meta-learning
algorithm that can sample models for a new task from a model distribution. Our approach
extends model-agnostic meta-learning, which adapts to new tasks via gradient descent,
to incorporate a parameter distribution that is trained via a variational lower bound.
At meta-test time, our algorithm adapts via a simple procedure that injects noise
into gradient descent, and at meta-training time, the model is trained such that this
stochastic adaptation procedure produces samples from the approximate model posterior.
Our experimental results show that our method can sample plausible classifiers and
regressors in ambiguous few-shot learning problems. We also show how reasoning about
ambiguity can also be used for downstream active learning problems.},

We propose a formalism for generating open-ended yet repetitious environments, then develop a meta-learning architecture for solving these environments.

We explore the capabilities of agents with this episodic LSTM in five meta-learning environments with reoccurring tasks, ranging from bandits to navigation and stochastic sequential decision problems.}

Previous research has shown that people rely on working memory (WM) in short-term recognition tasks; a common view is that episodic memory (EM) only influences performance on these tasks when WM maintenance is disrupted. However, retrieval of memories from EM has been widely observed during brief periods of quiescence, raising the possibility that EM retrievals during maintenance-critically, before a response can be prepared-might affect short-term recognition memory performance even in the absence of distraction. We hypothesized that this influence would be mediated by the lingering presence of reactivated EM content in WM. We obtained support for this hypothesis in three experiments, showing that delay-period EM reactivation introduces incidentally-associated information (context) into WM, and that these retrieved associations negatively impact subsequent recognition, leading to substitution errors (Experiment 1) and slowing of accurate responses (Experiment 2). fMRI pattern analysis showed that slowing is mediated by the content of EM reinstatement (Experiment 3). These results expose a previously hidden influence of EM on WM, raising new questions about the adaptive nature of their interaction.},

This new perspective accommodates the findings that motivated the standard model, but also deals gracefully with a wider range of observations, providing a fresh foundation for future research.},

abstract = {Exploration is a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning (RL). Many current
exploration methods for deep RL use task-agnostic objectives, such as information
gain or bonuses based on state visitation. However, many practical applications of
RL involve learning more than a single task, and prior tasks can be used to inform
how exploration should be performed in new tasks. In this work, we study how prior
tasks can inform an agent about how to explore effectively in new situations. We introduce
a novel gradient-based fast adaptation algorithm â€“ model agnostic exploration with
structured noise (MAESN) â€“ to learn exploration strategies from prior experience.
The prior experience is used both to initialize a policy and to acquire a latent exploration
space that can inject structured stochasticity into a policy, producing exploration
strategies that are informed by prior knowledge and are more effective than random
action-space noise. We show that MAESN is more effective at learning exploration strategies
when compared to prior meta-RL methods, RL without learned exploration strategies,
and task-agnostic exploration methods. We evaluate our method on a variety of simulated
tasks: locomotion with a wheeled robot, locomotion with a quadrupedal walker, and
object manipulation.},

abstract = {The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional
neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models
also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a
new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms,
dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation
tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable
and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the
WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results,
including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation
task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.0
after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs
of the best models from the literature.},

  abstract = 	 {The Transformer architecture has achieved considerable success recently; the key component of the Transformer is the attention layer that enables the model to focus on important regions within an input sequence. Gradient optimization with attention layers can be notoriously difficult requiring tricks such as learning rate warmup to prevent divergence. As Transformer models are becoming larger and more expensive to train, recent research has focused on understanding and improving optimization in these architectures. In this work our contributions are two-fold: we first investigate and empirically validate the source of optimization problems in the encoder-decoder Transformer architecture; we then propose a new weight initialization scheme with theoretical justification, that enables training without warmup or layer normalization. Empirical results on public machine translation benchmarks show that our approach achieves leading accuracy, allowing to train deep Transformer models with 200 layers in both encoder and decoder (over 1000 attention/MLP blocks) without difficulty.

By making several approximations to the theoretically-justified scheme, we develop a practical algorithm, called Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO). This algorithm is effective for optimizing large nonlinear policies such as neural networks. Our experiments demonstrate its robust performance on a wide variety of tasks: learning simulated robotic swimming, hopping, and walking gaits; and playing Atari games using images of the screen as input. Despite its approximations that deviate from the theory, TRPO tends to give monotonic improvement, with little tuning of hyperparameters.}

  abstract = 	 {Model-free deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have been demonstrated on a range of challenging decision making and control tasks. However, these methods typically suffer from two major challenges: very high sample complexity and brittle convergence properties, which necessitate meticulous hyperparameter tuning. Both of these challenges severely limit the applicability of such methods to complex, real-world domains. In this paper, we propose soft actor-critic, an off-policy actor-critic deep RL algorithm based on the maximum entropy reinforcement learning framework. In this framework, the actor aims to maximize expected reward while also maximizing entropy. That is, to succeed at the task while acting as randomly as possible. Prior deep RL methods based on this framework have been formulated as Q-learning methods. By combining off-policy updates with a stable stochastic actor-critic formulation, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on a range of continuous control benchmark tasks, outperforming prior on-policy and off-policy methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, in contrast to other off-policy algorithms, our approach is very stable, achieving very similar performance across different random seeds.}

Working memory refers to the system or systems that are assumed to be necessary in order to keep things in mind while performing complex tasks such as reasoning, comprehension and learning. Over the last 30 years, the concept of working memory has been increasingly widely used, extending from its origin in cognitive psychology to many areas of cognitive science and neuroscience, and been applied within areas ranging from education, through psychiatry to paleoanthropology.}
