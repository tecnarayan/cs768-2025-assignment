  abstract =   {Variational inference has become a widely used method to approximate posteriors in complex latent variables models.  However, deriving a variational inference algorithm generally requires significant model-specific analysis. These efforts can hinder and deter us from quickly developing and exploring a variety of models for a problem at hand.  In this paper, we present a “black box” variational inference algorithm, one that can be quickly applied to many models with little additional derivation.  Our method is based on a stochastic optimization of the variational objective where the noisy gradient is computed from Monte Carlo samples from the variational distribution.  We develop a number of methods to reduce the variance of the gradient, always maintaining the criterion that we want to avoid difficult model-based derivations.  We evaluate our method against the corresponding black box sampling based methods. We find that our method reaches better predictive likelihoods much faster than sampling methods. Finally, we demonstrate that Black Box Variational Inference lets us easily explore a wide space of models by quickly constructing and evaluating several models of longitudinal healthcare data.}

    abstract="We introduce graphical time series models for the analysis of dynamic relationships among variables in multivariate time series. The modelling approach is based on the notion of strong Granger causality and can be applied to time series with non-linear dependences. The models are derived from ordinary time series models by imposing constraints that are encoded by mixed graphs. In these graphs each component series is represented by a single vertex and directed edges indicate possible Granger-causal relationships between variables while undirected edges are used to map the contemporaneous dependence structure. We introduce various notions of Granger-causal Markov properties and discuss the relationships among them and to other Markov properties that can be applied in this context. Examples for graphical time series models include nonlinear autoregressive models and multivariate ARCH models.",
