	abstract = {Correlation clustering is a widely studied framework for clustering based on pairwise similarity and dissimilarity scores, but its best approximation algorithms rely on impractical linear programming relaxations. We present faster approximation algorithms that avoid these relaxations, for two well-studied special cases: cluster editing and cluster deletion. We accomplish this by drawing new connections to edge labeling problems related to the principle of strong triadic closure. This leads to faster and more practical linear programming algorithms, as well as extremely scalable combinatorial techniques, including the first combinatorial approximation algorithm for cluster deletion. In practice, our algorithms produce approximate solutions that nearly match the best algorithms in quality, while scaling to problems that are orders of magnitude larger.},

@article{AdaLasShe98,
	abstract = { An optimal solution to the continuous relaxation of a mixed-integer 0-1 linear programming problem is defined to be persistent if the set of 0-1 variables realizing binary values retains those same binary values in at least one integer optimum. A mixed-integer 0-1 linear program is said to possess the persistency property, or equivalently to be persistent, if every optimal solution to the continuous relaxation is a persistent solution. We study the issue of persistency for a special family of mixed-integer 0-1 linear programming problems which derive from the linearization strategy of Sherali and Adams (1990). In particular, we first examine the hierarchy of linearizations which result from applying this strategy to the general class of unconstrained 0-1 polynomial programming problems, and then consider a class of specially-structured constrained problems. Our study of persistency differs from previous works in that we use the explicit algebraic representation of the convex hull of feasible binary solutions available at the highest level of this hierarchy as a tool for making inferences relative to optimal integer solutions from optimal continuous solutions. Each level of this hierarchy consists of a mixed-integer 0-1 linear program, and we provide, for any given optimal solution to the continuous relaxation of any member of this hierarchy, a set of sufficient conditions on the optimal dual multipliers for the solution to be persistent. These sufficient conditions turn out to be satisfied at every optimal solution of the quadratic level, and thus allow for the reformulation of any unconstrained 0-1 quadratic programming problem as a persistent mixed-integer linear program in a suitably-defined higher-dimensional space. We subsequently address the family of constrained 0-1 polynomial programs and use a projection operation to prove that a special family of 0-1 linear programs possesses the persistency property; included in this family is a generalization of the vertex packing problem that permits quadratic objective function coefficients. Unlike earlier published works on the vertex packing and related problems, our proofs do not rely on Balinski's (1965) extreme point characterization. },

Hammer, Hansen and Simeone (1984) have proposed to determine these variables using a procedure described by Balinski for computing a strongly complementary pair of optimal primal and dual solutions for arbitrary linear programs. We propose a linear time algorithm for determining these variables from a ``best roof''off, i.e. from a lowest upper linear bound off.},

@inproceedings{KohEtAl08,
	abstract = {We consider the problem of optimizing multilabel MRFs, which is in general NP-hard and ubiquitous in low-level computer vision. One approach for its solution is to formulate it as an integer linear programming and relax the integrality constraints. The approach we consider in this paper is to first convert the multi-label MRF into an equivalent binary-label MRF and then to relax it. The resulting relaxation can be efficiently solved using a maximum flow algorithm. Its solution provides us with a partially optimal labelling of the binary variables. This partial labelling is then easily transferred to the multi-label problem. We study the theoretical properties of the new relaxation and compare it with the standard one. Specifically, we compare tightness, and characterize a subclass of problems where the two relaxations coincide. We propose several combined algorithms based on the technique and demonstrate their performance on challenging computer vision problems.},

@article{KapSpeReiSch16,
	abstract = {Multicuts enable to conveniently represent discrete graphical models for unsupervised and supervised image segmentation, in the case of local energy functions that exhibit symmetries. The basic Potts model and natural extensions thereof to higher-order models provide a prominent class of such objectives, that cover a broad range of segmentation problems relevant to image analysis and computer vision. We exhibit a way to systematically take into account such higher-order terms for computational inference. Furthermore, we present results of a comprehensive and competitive numerical evaluation of a variety of dedicated cutting-plane algorithms. Our approach enables the globally optimal evaluation of a significant subset of these models, without compromising runtime. Polynomially solvable relaxations are studied as well, along with advanced rounding schemes for post-processing.},
