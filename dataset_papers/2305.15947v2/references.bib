	title = {Exploring the promise and limits of real-time recurrent learning},
	abstract = {Real-time recurrent learning (RTRL) for sequence-processing recurrent neural networks (RNNs) offers certain conceptual advantages over backpropagation through time (BPTT). RTRL requires neither caching past activations nor truncating context, and enables online learning. However, RTRL's time and space complexity make it impractical. To overcome this problem, most recent work on RTRL focuses on approximation theories, while experiments are often limited to diagnostic settings. Here we explore the practical promise of RTRL in more realistic settings. We study actor-critic methods that combine RTRL and policy gradients, and test them in several subsets of DMLab-30, ProcGen, and Atari-2600 environments. On DMLab memory tasks, our system trained on fewer than 1.2 B environmental frames is competitive with or outperforms well-known IMPALA and R2D2 baselines trained on 10 B frames. To scale to such challenging tasks, we focus on certain well-known neural architectures with element-wise recurrence, allowing for tractable RTRL without approximation. We also discuss rarely addressed limitations of RTRL in real-world applications, such as its complexity in the multi-layer case.},

	title = {On the properties of neural machine translation: encoder-decoder approaches},
	abstract = {Neural machine translation is a relatively new approach to statistical machine translation based purely on neural networks. The neural machine translation models often consist of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder extracts a ﬁxed-length representation from a variable-length input sentence, and the decoder generates a correct translation from this representation. In this paper, we focus on analyzing the properties of the neural machine translation using two models; RNN Encoder–Decoder and a newly proposed gated recursive convolutional neural network. We show that the neural machine translation performs relatively well on short sentences without unknown words, but its performance degrades rapidly as the length of the sentence and the number of unknown words increase. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that the proposed gated recursive convolutional network learns a grammatical structure of a sentence automatically.},

However, finding that fundamental circuit has proved elusive, although partial drafts of a “canonical circuit” appear in many different guises of structure and function. Here, we review some critical stages in the history of this quest. In doing so, we consider the style of cortical computation in relation to the neuronal machinery that supports it.

Because the thalamus is composed of excitatory neurons that are devoid of local recurrent excitatory connectivity, delineating long-range, input-output connectivity patterns of single thalamic neurons is critical for building functional models. We discuss this need in relation to existing organizational schemes such as core versus matrix and first-order versus higher-order relay nuclei.

Our results may be at variance with the ideas of those physiologists who have specialized subsystems of the cortex in mind, but are not in contrast with them, as we hope to show. Our view is akin to one presented by Moshe Abeles in his monograph Local Cortical Circuits ( 1982). It is related to the theory developed by Gunther Palm, for many years our partner, in Neural Assemblies (1982). It owes much to the ideas which inspire the work of George Gerstein (beginning with the classic: Gerstein 1962) and especially to the insights gained by our colleague Ad Aertsen and his group in TUbingen. Our ideas on the cortex find some resonance in a recent trend in Artificial Intelligence (Kohonen 1977; Hopfield 1982; Rumelhart et al. 1986), and indeed the diagram (Braitenberg 1974a) representing the dominant idea of that trend, the associative matrix with feedback, has served as an emblem for the editorial enterprise Studies of Brain Function since its inception in 1977.

While this idea was born out of experiments that cleverly combined electrophysiological recordings with anatomy, no one has ‘seen’ the anatomy of a column. All we know is that when we record through the cortex of primates, ungulates, and carnivores in a trajectory perpendicular to its surface there is a remarkable constancy in the receptive field properties of the neurons regarding one set of stimulus features. There is no obvious morphological analog for this functional architecture, in fact much of the anatomical data seems to challenge it. Here we describe historically the origins of the concept of the cortical column and the struggles of the pioneers to define the columnar architecture. We suggest that in the concept of a ‘canonical circuit’ we may find the means to reconcile the structure of neocortex with its functional architecture. The canonical microcircuit respects the known connectivity of the neocortex, and it is flexible enough to change transiently the architecture of its network in order to perform the required computations.},

All layers, or more generally, modules, of the network are therefore locked, in the sense that they must wait for the remainder of the network to execute forwards and propagate error backwards before they can be updated. In this work we break this constraint by decoupling modules by introducing a model of the future computation of the network graph. These models predict what the result of the modelled subgraph will produce using only local information. In particular we focus on modelling error gradients: by using the modelled synthetic gradient in place of true backpropagated error gradients we decouple subgraphs, and can update them independently and asynchronously i.e. we realise decoupled neural interfaces. We show results for feed-forward models, where every layer is trained asynchronously, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) where predicting one’s future gradient extends the time over which the RNN can effectively model, and also a hierarchical RNN system with ticking at different timescales. Finally, we demonstrate that in addition to predicting gradients, the same framework can be used to predict inputs, resulting in models which are decoupled in both the forward and backwards pass – amounting to independent networks which co-learn such that they can be composed into a single functioning corporation.},

	abstract = {Training state-of-the-art, deep neural networks is computationally expensive. One way to reduce the training time is to normalize the activities of the neurons. A recently introduced technique called batch normalization uses the distribution of the summed input to a neuron over a mini-batch of training cases to compute a mean and variance which are then used to normalize the summed input to that neuron on each training case. This signiﬁcantly reduces the training time in feedforward neural networks. However, the effect of batch normalization is dependent on the mini-batch size and it is not obvious how to apply it to recurrent neural networks. In this paper, we transpose batch normalization into layer normalization by computing the mean and variance used for normalization from all of the summed inputs to the neurons in a layer on a single training case. Like batch normalization, we also give each neuron its own adaptive bias and gain which are applied after the normalization but before the non-linearity. Unlike batch normalization, layer normalization performs exactly the same computation at training and test times. It is also straightforward to apply to recurrent neural networks by computing the normalization statistics separately at each time step. Layer normalization is very effective at stabilizing the hidden state dynamics in recurrent networks. Empirically, we show that layer normalization can substantially reduce the training time compared with previously published techniques.},

Our principle casts learning as a least-control problem, where we first introduce an optimal controller to lead the system towards a solution state, and then define learning as reducing the amount of control needed to reach such a state. We show that incorporating learning signals within a dynamics as an optimal control enables transmitting activity-dependent credit assignment information, avoids storing intermediate states in memory, and does not rely on infinitesimal learning signals. In practice, our principle leads to strong performance matching that of leading gradient-based learning methods when applied to an array of problems involving recurrent neural networks and meta-learning.

The principle postulates that the somato-dendritic mismatch errors across all neurons in a cortical network are minimized by the voltage dynamics. Ongoing synaptic plasticity reduces the somato-dendritic mismatch error within each neuron and performs gradient descent on the output cost in real time. The neuronal activity is prospective, ensuring that dendritic errors deep in the network are prospectively corrected to eventually reduce motor errors. The neuron-specific errors are represented in the apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons, and are extracted by a cortical microcircuit that ‘explains away’ the feedback from the periphery.

Nonetheless, recent developments in neuroscience and the successes of artificial neural networks have reinvigorated interest in whether backpropagation offers insights for understanding learning in the cortex. The backpropagation algorithm learns quickly by computing synaptic updates using feedback connections to deliver error signals. Although feedback connections are ubiquitous in the cortex, it is difficult to see how they could deliver the error signals required by strict formulations of backpropagation. Here we build on past and recent developments to argue that feedback connections may instead induce neural activities whose differences can be used to locally approximate these signals and hence drive effective learning in deep networks in the brain.},

Traditional firing-rate models assume a simple form in which the dynamics are governed by a single time constant.

We present a complex-valued firing-rate model derived from an eigenfunction expansion of the Fokker-Planck equation and apply it to the linear, quadratic and exponential integrate-and-fire models. Despite being almost as simple as a traditional firing-rate description, this model can reproduce firing-rate dynamics due to partial synchronization of the action potentials in a spiking model, and it successfully predicts the transition to spike synchronization in networks of coupled excitatory and inhibitory neurons.},

Even in machine learning the use of BPTT in classic neural network architectures has proven insufficient for some challenging temporal credit assignment (TCA) problems that we know the brain is capable of solving. Nonetheless, recent work in machine learning has made progress in solving difficult TCA problems by employing novel memory-based and attention-based architectures and algorithms, some of which are brain inspired. Importantly, these recent machine learning methods have been developed in the context of, and with reference to BPTT, and thus serve to strengthen BPTT's position as a useful normative guide for thinking about temporal credit assignment in artificial and biological systems alike.},

	title = {Hungry hungry hippos: towards language modeling with state space models},
	abstract = {State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence modeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language modeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2\${\textbackslash}times\$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4\${\textbackslash}times\$ faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.},

First, inhibition and excitation are not separable events. Activation of the cortex inevitably sets in motion a sequence of excitation and inhibition in every neuron. Second, the thalamic input does not provide the major excitation arriving at any neuron. Instead the intracortical excitatory connections provide most of the excitation. Third, the time evolution of excitation and inhibition is far longer than the synaptic delays of the circuits involved. This means that cortical processing cannot rely on precise timing between individual synaptic inputs.},

However, finding that fundamental circuit has proved elusive, although partial drafts of a “canonical circuit” appear in many different guises of structure and function. Here, we review some critical stages in the history of this quest. In doing so, we consider the style of cortical computation in relation to the neuronal machinery that supports it.

The classical cytoarchitectural areas of the neocortex are composed of smaller units, local neural circuits repeated iteratively within each area. Modules may vary in cell type and number, in internal and external connectivity, and in mode of neuronal processing between different large entities; within any single large entity they have a basic similarity of internal design and operation. Modules are most commonly grouped into entities by sets of dominating external connections. This unifying factor is most obvious for the heterotypical sensory and motor areas of the neocortex. Columnar defining factors in homotypical areas are generated, in part, within the cortex itself. The set of all modules composing such an entity may be fractionated into different modular subsets by different extrinsic connections. Linkages between them and subsets in other large entities form distributed systems. The neighborhood relations between connected subsets of modules in different entities result in nested distributed systems that serve distributed functions. A cortical area defined in classical cytoarchitectural terms may belong to more than one and sometimes to several distributed systems. Columns in cytoarchitectural areas located at some distance from one another, but with some common properties, may be linked by long-range, intracortical connections.},

CL is an extension of Deterministic Boltzmann Machines to more general dynamical systems. During learning, the network oscillates between two phases. One phase has a teacher signal and one phase has no teacher signal. The weights are updated using a learning rule that corresponds to gradient descent on a contrast function that measures the discrepancy between the free network and the network with a teacher signal. The CL approach provides a general unified framework for developing new learning algorithms. It also shows that many different types of clamping and teacher signals are possible. Several examples are given and an analysis of the landscape of the contrast function is proposed with some relevant predictions for the CL curves. An approach that may be suitable for collective analog implementations is described. Simulation results and possible extensions are briefly discussed together with a new conjecture regarding the function of certain oscillations in the brain.

	abstract = {Information coding by precise timing of spikes can be faster and more energy efficient than traditional rate coding. However, spike-timing codes are often brittle, which has limited their use in theoretical neuroscience and computing applications. Here, we propose a type of attractor neural network in complex state space and show how it can be leveraged to construct spiking neural networks with robust computational properties through a phase-to-timing mapping. Building on Hebbian neural associative memories, like Hopfield networks, we first propose threshold phasor associative memory (TPAM) networks. Complex phasor patterns whose components can assume continuous-valued phase angles and binary magnitudes can be stored and retrieved as stable fixed points in the network dynamics. TPAM achieves high memory capacity when storing sparse phasor patterns, and we derive the energy function that governs its fixed-point attractor dynamics. Second, we construct 2 spiking neural networks to approximate the complex algebraic computations in TPAM, a reductionist model with resonate-and-fire neurons and a biologically plausible network of integrate-and-fire neurons with synaptic delays and recurrently connected inhibitory interneurons. The fixed points of TPAM correspond to stable periodic states of precisely timed spiking activity that are robust to perturbation. The link established between rhythmic firing patterns and complex attractor dynamics has implications for the interpretation of spike patterns seen in neuroscience and can serve as a framework for computation in emerging neuromorphic devices.},

It thus provides a compelling framework for training neuromorphic systems and understanding learning in neurobiology. However, EP requires infinitesimal teaching signals, thereby limiting its applicability in noisy physical systems. Moreover, the algorithm requires separate temporal phases and has not been applied to large-scale problems. Here we address these issues by extending EP to holomorphic networks. We show analytically that this extension naturally leads to exact gradients even for finite-amplitude teaching signals. Importantly, the gradient can be computed as the first Fourier coefficient from finite neuronal activity oscillations in continuous time without requiring separate phases. Further, we demonstrate in numerical simulations that our approach permits robust estimation of gradients in the presence of noise and that deeper models benefit from the finite teaching signals. Finally, we establish the first benchmark for EP on the ImageNet 32x32 dataset and show that it matches the performance of an equivalent network trained with BP. Our work provides analytical insights that enable scaling EP to large-scale problems and establishes a formal framework for how oscillations could support learning in biological and neuromorphic systems.},

Individual neurons are able to model nonlinear functions via the use of data-dependent gating in conjunction with online convex optimization. We show that this architecture gives rise to universal learning capabilities in the limit, with effective model capacity increasing as a function of network size in a manner comparable with deep ReLU networks.

	title = {Efficiently modeling long sequences with structured state spaces},
	abstract = {A central goal of sequence modeling is designing a single principled model that can address sequence data across a range of modalities and tasks, particularly on long-range dependencies. Although conventional models including RNNs, CNNs, and Transformers have specialized variants for capturing long dependencies, they still struggle to scale to very long sequences of \$10000\$ or more steps. A promising recent approach proposed modeling sequences by simulating the fundamental state space model (SSM) {\textbackslash}( x'(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t), y(t) = Cx(t) + Du(t) {\textbackslash}), and showed that for appropriate choices of the state matrix {\textbackslash}( A {\textbackslash}), this system could handle long-range dependencies mathematically and empirically. However, this method has prohibitive computation and memory requirements, rendering it infeasible as a general sequence modeling solution. We propose the Structured State Space sequence model (S4) based on a new parameterization for the SSM, and show that it can be computed much more efficiently than prior approaches while preserving their theoretical strengths. Our technique involves conditioning {\textbackslash}( A {\textbackslash}) with a low-rank correction, allowing it to be diagonalized stably and reducing the SSM to the well-studied computation of a Cauchy kernel. S4 achieves strong empirical results across a diverse range of established benchmarks, including (i) 91{\textbackslash}\% accuracy on sequential CIFAR-10 with no data augmentation or auxiliary losses, on par with a larger 2-D ResNet, (ii) substantially closing the gap to Transformers on image and language modeling tasks, while performing generation \$60{\textbackslash}times\$ faster (iii) SoTA on every task from the Long Range Arena benchmark, including solving the challenging Path-X task of length 16k that all prior work fails on, while being as efficient as all competitors.},

	title = {{HiPPO}: recurrent memory with optimal polynomial projections},
	volume = {33},
	abstract = {A central problem in learning from sequential data is representing cumulative
history in an incremental fashion as more data is processed. We introduce a general framework (HiPPO) for the online compression of continuous signals and discrete time series by projection onto polynomial bases. Given a measure that specifies the importance of each time step in the past, HiPPO produces an optimal solution to a natural online function approximation problem. As special cases, our framework yields a short derivation of the recent Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) from first principles, and generalizes the ubiquitous gating mechanism of recurrent neural networks such as GRUs. This formal framework yields a new memory update mechanism (HiPPO-LegS) that scales through time to remember all history, avoiding priors on the timescale. HiPPO-LegS enjoys the theoretical benefits of timescale robustness, fast updates, and bounded gradients. By incorporating the memory dynamics into recurrent neural networks, HiPPO RNNs can empirically capture complex temporal dependencies. On the benchmark permuted MNIST dataset, HiPPO-LegS sets a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 98.3\%. Finally, on a novel trajectory classification task testing robustness to out-of-distribution timescales and missing data, HiPPO-LegS outperforms RNN and neural ODE baselines by 25-40\% accuracy.},

	title = {Learning by directional gradient descent},
	abstract = {How should state be constructed from a sequence of observations, so as to best achieve some objective? Most deep learning methods update the parameters of the state representation by gradient descent. However, no prior method for computing the gradient is fully satisfactory, for example consuming too much memory, introducing too much variance, or adding too much bias. In this work, we propose a new learning algorithm that addresses these limitations. The basic idea is to update the parameters of the representation by using the directional derivative along a candidate direction, a quantity that may be computed online with the same computational cost as the representation itself. We consider several different choices of candidate direction, including random selection and approximations to the true gradient, and investigate their performance on several synthetic tasks.},

	title = {The remarkable robustness of surrogate gradient learning for instilling complex function in spiking neural networks},
	volume = {33},
	abstract = {Brains process information in spiking neural networks. Their intricate connections shape the diverse functions these networks perform. Yet how network connectivity relates to function is poorly understood, and the functional capabilities of models of spiking networks are still rudimentary. The lack of both theoretical insight and practical algorithms to find the necessary connectivity poses a major impediment to both studying information processing in the brain and building efficient neuromorphic hardware systems. The training algorithms that solve this problem for artificial neural networks typically rely on gradient descent. But doing so in spiking networks has remained challenging due to the nondifferentiable nonlinearity of spikes. To avoid this issue, one can employ surrogate gradients to discover the required connectivity. However, the choice of a surrogate is not unique, raising the question of how its implementation influences the effectiveness of the method. Here, we use numerical simulations to systematically study how essential design parameters of surrogate gradients affect learning performance on a range of classification problems. We show that surrogate gradient learning is robust to different shapes of underlying surrogate derivatives, but the choice of the derivative's scale can substantially affect learning performance. When we combine surrogate gradients with suitable activity regularization techniques, spiking networks perform robust information processing at the sparse activity limit. Our study provides a systematic account of the remarkable robustness of surrogate gradient learning and serves as a practical guide to model functional spiking neural networks.},

	title = {Unbiased online recurrent optimization},
	abstract = {The novel Unbiased Online Recurrent Optimization (UORO) algorithm allows for online learning of general recurrent computational graphs such as recurrent network models. It works in a streaming fashion and avoids backtracking through past activations and inputs. UORO is computationally as costly as Truncated Backpropagation Through Time (truncated BPTT), a widespread algorithm for online learning of recurrent networks. UORO is a modification of NoBackTrack that bypasses the need for model sparsity and makes implementation easy in current deep learning frameworks, even for complex models. Like NoBackTrack, UORO provides unbiased gradient estimates; unbiasedness is the core hypothesis in stochastic gradient descent theory, without which convergence to a local optimum is not guaranteed. On the contrary, truncated BPTT does not provide this property, leading to possible divergence. On synthetic tasks where truncated BPTT is shown to diverge, UORO converges. For instance, when a parameter has a positive short-term but negative long-term influence, truncated BPTT diverges unless the truncation span is very significantly longer than the intrinsic temporal range of the interactions, while UORO performs well thanks to the unbiasedness of its gradients.},

	title = {A practical sparse approximation for real time recurrent learning},
	abstract = {Current methods for training recurrent neural networks are based on backpropagation through time, which requires storing a complete history of network states, and prohibits updating the weights `online' (after every timestep). Real Time Recurrent Learning (RTRL) eliminates the need for history storage and allows for online weight updates, but does so at the expense of computational costs that are quartic in the state size. This renders RTRL training intractable for all but the smallest networks, even ones that are made highly sparse. We introduce the Sparse n-step Approximation (SnAp) to the RTRL influence matrix, which only keeps entries that are nonzero within n steps of the recurrent core. SnAp with n=1 is no more expensive than backpropagation, and we find that it substantially outperforms other RTRL approximations with comparable costs such as Unbiased Online Recurrent Optimization. For highly sparse networks, SnAp with n=2 remains tractable and can outperform backpropagation through time in terms of learning speed when updates are done online. SnAp becomes equivalent to RTRL when n is large.},

	title = {Memory traces in dynamical systems},
	volume = {105},
	abstract = {To perform nontrivial, real-time computations on a sensory input stream, biological systems must retain a short-term memory trace of their recent inputs. It has been proposed that generic high-dimensional dynamical systems could retain a memory trace for past inputs in their current state. This raises important questions about the fundamental limits of such memory traces and the properties required of dynamical systems to achieve these limits. We address these issues by applying Fisher information theory to dynamical systems driven by time-dependent signals corrupted by noise. We introduce the Fisher Memory Curve (FMC) as a measure of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) embedded in the dynamical state relative to the input SNR. The integrated FMC indicates the total memory capacity. We apply this theory to linear neuronal networks and show that the capacity of networks with normal connectivity matrices is exactly 1 and that of any network of N neurons is, at most, N. A nonnormal network achieving this bound is subject to stringent design constraints: It must have a hidden feedforward architecture that superlinearly amplifies its input for a time of order N, and the input connectivity must optimally match this architecture. The memory capacity of networks subject to saturating nonlinearities is further limited, and cannot exceed 
𝑁
‾
‾
√
𝑁
. This limit can be realized by feedforward structures with divergent fan out that distributes the signal across neurons, thereby avoiding saturation. We illustrate the generality of the theory by showing that memory in fluid systems can be sustained by transient nonnormal amplification due to convective instability or the onset of turbulence.},

One of these avenues is the exploration of new alternative brain-inspired computing architectures that promise to achieve the flexibility and computational efficiency of biological neural processing systems. Within this context, neuromorphic intelligence represents a paradigm shift in computing based on the implementation of spiking neural network architectures tightly co-locating processing and memory. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the field, highlighting the different levels of granularity present in existing silicon implementations, comparing approaches that aim at replicating natural intelligence (bottom-up) versus those that aim at solving practical artificial intelligence applications (top-down), and assessing the benefits of the different circuit design styles used to achieve these goals. First, we present the analog, mixed-signal and digital circuit design styles, identifying the boundary between processing and memory through time multiplexing, in-memory computation and novel devices. Next, we highlight the key tradeoffs for each of the bottom-up and top-down approaches, survey their silicon implementations, and carry out detailed comparative analyses to extract design guidelines. Finally, we identify both necessary synergies and missing elements required to achieve a competitive advantage for neuromorphic edge computing over conventional machine-learning accelerators, and outline the key elements for a framework toward neuromorphic intelligence.},

In this Review, we argue that the persistent discharges of prefrontal neurons play the most important part in the maintenance of information in WM.Effects of WM training include increases in the activity of neurons in the prefrontal cortex, and increases in the strength of connectivity in the prefrontal cortex and between the prefrontal cortex and other areas.Neural changes after training are found in cortical areas that process spatial information in WM and attention, potentially providing a basis for transfer to other cognitive and behavioural tasks that rely on spatial WM and spatially selective attention.},
