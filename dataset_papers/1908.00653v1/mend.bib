abstract = {We study a generalization of covering problems called partial covering. Here we wish to cover only a desired number of elements, rather than covering all elements as in standard covering problems. For example, in k-partial set cover, we wish to choose a minimum number of sets to cover at least k elements. For k-partial set cover, if each element occurs in at most f sets, then we derive a primal-dual f-approximation algorithm (thus implying a 2-approximation for k-partial vertex cover) in polynomial time. Without making any assumption about the number of sets an element is in, for instances where each set has cardinality at most three, we obtain an approximation of 4/3. We also present better-than-2-approximation algorithms for k-partial vertex cover on bounded degree graphs, and for vertex cover on expanders of bounded average degree. We obtain a polynomial-time approximation scheme for k-partial vertex cover on planar graphs, and for covering k points in Rd by disks. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A modified shortest path network interdiction model is approximated in this work by a constrained binary knapsack which uses aggregated arc maximum flow as the objective function coefficient. In the modified shortest path network interdiction problem, an attacker selects a path of highest non-detection probability on a network with multiple origins and multiple available targets. A defender allocates a limited number of resources within the geographic region of the network to reduce the maximum network non-detection probability between all origin-target pairs by reducing arc non-detection probabilities and where path non-detection probability is modeled as a product of all arc non-detection probabilities on that path. Traditional decomposition methods to solve the shortest path network interdiction problem are sensitive to problem size and network/regional complexity. The goal of this paper is to develop a method for approximating the regional allocation of defense resources that maintains accuracy while reducing both computational effort and the sensitivity of computation time to network/regional properties. Statistical and spatial analysis methods are utilized to verify approximation performance of the knapsack method in two real-world networks. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Given a social network G and a constant k, the influence maximization problem asks for k nodes in G that (directly and indirectly) influence the largest number of nodes under a pre-defined diffusion model. This problem finds important applications in viral marketing, and has been extensively studied in the literature. Existing algorithms for influence maximization, however, either trade approximation guarantees for practical efficiency, or vice versa. In particular, among the algorithms that achieve constant factor approximations under the prominent independent cascade (IC) model or linear threshold (LT) model, none can handle a million-node graph without incurring prohibitive overheads. This paper presents TIM, an algorithm that aims to bridge the theory and practice in influence maximization. On the theory side, we show that TIM runs in O((k+$\backslash$ell) (n+m) $\backslash$log n / $\backslash$epsilon{\^{}}2) expected time and returns a (1-1/e-$\backslash$epsilon)-approximate solution with at least 1 - n{\^{}}{\{}-$\backslash$ell{\}} probability. The time complexity of TIM is near-optimal under the IC model, as it is only a $\backslash$log n factor larger than the $\backslash$Omega(m + n) lower-bound established in previous work (for fixed k, $\backslash$ell, and $\backslash$epsilon). Moreover, TIM supports the triggering model, which is a general diffusion model that includes both IC and LT as special cases. On the practice side, TIM incorporates novel heuristics that significantly improve its empirical efficiency without compromising its asymptotic performance. We experimentally evaluate TIM with the largest datasets ever tested in the literature, and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions (with approximation guarantees) by up to four orders of magnitude in terms of running time. In particular, when k = 50, $\backslash$epsilon = 0.2, and $\backslash$ell = 1, TIM requires less than one hour on a commodity machine to process a network with 41.6 million nodes and 1.4 billion edges.},

abstract = {Social networks are commonly used for marketing purposes. For example, free samples of a product can be given to a few influential social network users (or "seed nodes"), with the hope that they will convince their friends to buy it. One way to formalize marketers' objective is through influence maximization (or IM), whose goal is to find the best seed nodes to activate under a fixed budget, so that the number of people who get influenced in the end is maximized. Recent solutions to IM rely on the influence probability that a user influences another one. However, this probability information may be unavailable or incomplete. In this paper, we study IM in the absence of complete information on influence probability. We call this problem Online Influence Maximization (OIM) since we learn influence probabilities at the same time we run influence campaigns. To solve OIM, we propose a multiple-trial approach, where (1) some seed nodes are selected based on existing influence information; (2) an influence campaign is started with these seed nodes; and (3) users' feedback is used to update influence information. We adopt the Explore-Exploit strategy, which can select seed nodes using either the current influence probability estimation (exploit), or the confidence bound on the estimation (explore). Any existing IM algorithm can be used in this framework. We also develop an incremental algorithm that can significantly reduce the overhead of handling users' feedback information. Our experiments show that our solution is more effective than traditional IM methods on the partial information.},

abstract = {Combinatorial (or discrete) optimization is one of the most active fields in the interface of operations research, computer science, and applied math ematics. Combinatorial optimization problems arise in various applications, including communications network design, VLSI design, machine vision, air line crew scheduling, corporate planning, computer-aided design and man ufacturing, database query design, cellular telephone frequency assignment, constraint directed reasoning, and computational biology. Furthermore, combinatorial optimization problems occur in many diverse areas such as linear and integer programming, graph theory, artificial intelligence, and number theory. All these problems, when formulated mathematically as the minimization or maximization of a certain function defined on some domain, have a commonality of discreteness. Historically, combinatorial optimization starts with linear programming. Linear programming has an entire range of important applications including production planning and distribution, personnel assignment, finance, alloca tion of economic resources, circuit simulation, and control systems. Leonid Kantorovich and Tjalling Koopmans received the Nobel Prize (1975) for their work on the optimal allocation of resources. Two important discover ies, the ellipsoid method (1979) and interior point approaches (1984) both provide polynomial time algorithms for linear programming. These algo rithms have had a profound effect in combinatorial optimization. Many polynomial-time solvable combinatorial optimization problems are special cases of linear programming (e.g. matching and maximum flow). In addi tion, linear programming relaxations are often the basis for many approxi mation algorithms for solving NP-hard problems (e.g. dual heuristics).},

abstract = {There is a widespread intuitive sense that different kinds of information spread differently on-line, but it has been difficult to evaluate this question quantitatively since it requires a setting where many different kinds of information spread in a shared environment. Here we study this issue on Twitter, analyzing the ways in which tokens known as hashtags spread on a network defined by the interactions among Twitter users. We find significant variation in the ways that widely-used hashtags on different topics spread. Our results show that this variation is not attributable simply to differences in "stickiness," the probability of adoption based on one or more exposures, but also to a quantity that could be viewed as a kind of "persistence" - the relative extent to which repeated exposures to a hashtag continue to have significant marginal effects. We find that hashtags on politically controversial topics are particularly persistent, with repeated exposures continuing to have unusually large marginal effects on adoption; this provides, to our knowledge, the first large-scale validation of the "complex contagion" principle from sociology, which posits that repeated exposures to an idea are particularly crucial when the idea is in some way controversial or contentious. Among other findings, we discover that hashtags representing the natural analogues of Twitter idioms and neologisms are particularly non-persistent, with the effect of multiple exposures decaying rapidly relative to the first exposure. We also study the subgraph structure of the initial adopters for different widely-adopted hashtags, again finding structural differences across topics. We develop simulation-based and generative models to analyze how the adoption dynamics interact with the network structure of the early adopters on which a hashtag spreads.},

abstract = {A vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) is a subclass of mobile ad hoc networks, considered as one of the most important approach of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). It allows inter-vehicle communication in which their movement is restricted by a VANET mobility model and supported by some roadside base stations as fixed infrastructures. Multicasting provides different traffic information to a limited number of vehicle drivers by a parallel transmission. However, it represents a very important challenge in the application of vehicular ad hoc networks especially, in the case of the network scalability. In the applications of this sensitive field, it is very essential to transmit correct data anywhere and at any time. Consequently, the VANET routing protocols should be adapted appropriately and meet effectively the quality of service (QoS) requirements in an optimized multicast routing. In this paper, we propose a novel bee colony optimization algorithm called bees life algorithm (BLA) applied to solve the quality of service multicast routing problem (QoS-MRP) for vehicular ad hoc networks as NP-Complete problem with multiple constraints. It is considered as swarm-based algorithm which imitates closely the life of the colony. It follows the two important behaviors in the nature of bees which are the reproduction and the food foraging. BLA is applied to solve QoS-MRP with four objectives which are cost, delay, jitter, and bandwidth. It is also submitted to three constraints which are maximum allowed delay, maximum allowed jitter and minimum requested bandwidth. In order to evaluate the performance and the effectiveness of this realized proposal using C++ and integrated at the routing protocol level, a simulation study has been performed using the network simulator (NS2) based on a mobility model of VANET. The comparisons of the experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperformed in an efficient way genetic algorithm (GA), bees algorithm (BA) and marriage in honey bees optimization (MBO) algorithm as state-of-the-art conventional metaheuristics applied to QoS-MRP problem with the same simulation parameters. ?? 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Deorowicz and Grabowski (Bioinformatics, 2011) pointed out that letting each phrase end with a mismatch character usually gives better compression because many of the differences between individuals' genomes are single-nucleotide substitutions. Ferrada et al. (SPIRE 2014) then pointed out that also using relative pointers and run-length compressing them usually gives even better compression. In this paper we generalize Ferrada et al.'s idea to handle well also short insertions, deletions and multi-character substitutions.

Recent work has demonstrated that under perfect information (which nodes are/are not infected), the budget required for curing a graph precisely depends on its CutWidth. We develop a model for observation uncertainty, and show that even a minor degradation in the assumption of perfect knowledge of the state of the infection drastically alters the landscape -- infections that could previously be cured in sublinear time, now may require exponential time to cure. Our main result characterizes the necessary curing budget required as a function of the per-node observation uncertainty.},

abstract = {Our dependence on networks – be they infrastructure, economic, social or others – leaves us prone to crises caused by the vulnerabilities of these networks. There is a great need to develop new methods to protect infrastructure networks and prevent cascade of failures (especially in cases of coupled networks). Terrorist attacks on transportation networks have traumatized modern societies. With a single blast, it has become possible to paralyze airline traffic, electric power supply, ground transportation or Internet communication. How, and at which cost can one restructure the network such that it will become more robust against malicious attacks? The gradual increase in attacks on the networks society depends on – Internet, mobile phone, transportation, air travel, banking, etc. – emphasize the need to develop new strategies to protect and defend these crucial networks of communication and infrastructure networks. One example is the threat of liquid explosives a few years ago, which completely shut down air travel for days, and has created extreme changes in regulations. Such threats and dangers warrant the need for new tools and strategies to defend critical infrastructure. In this paper we review recent advances in the theoretical understanding of the vulnerabilities of interdependent networks with and without spatial embedding, attack strategies and their affect on such networks of networks as well as recently developed strategies to optimize and repair failures caused by such attacks.},

abstract = {IEEE Motivated by online social networks that are linked together through overlapping users, we study the influence maximization problem on a multiplex, with each layer endowed with its own model of influence diffusion. This problem is a novel version of the influence maximization problem that necessitates new analysis incorporating the type of propagation on each layer of the multiplex. We identify a new property, generalized deterministic submodular, which when satisfied by the propagation in each layer, ensures that the propagation on the multiplex overall is submodular-for this case, we formulate influential seed finder (ISF), the greedy algorithm with approximation ratio (1-1/e). Since the size of a multiplex comprising multiple OSNs may encompass billions of users, we formulate an algorithm knapsack seeding of network (KSN) that runs on each layer of the multiplex in parallel. KSN takes an  {\&} {\#}x03B1;-approximation algorithm A for the influence maximization problem on a single network as input, and has approximation ratio ((1 -  {\&} {\#}x03B5;)  {\&} {\#}x03B1;)/((o + 1)k) for arbitrary  {\&} {\#}x03B5;  {\&} {\#}x003E; 0, o is the number of overlapping users, and k is the number of layers in the multiplex.

abstract = {The investigation of community structures in networks is an important issue in many domains and disciplines. This problem is relevant for social tasks (objective analysis of relationships on the web), biological inquiries (functional studies in metabolic and protein networks), or technological problems (optimization of large infrastructures). Several types of algorithms exist for revealing the community structure in networks, but a general and quantitative definition of community is not implemented in the algorithms, leading to an intrinsic difficulty in the interpretation of the results without any additional nontopological information. In this article we deal with this problem by showing how quantitative definitions of community are implemented in practice in the existing algorithms. In this way the algorithms for the identification of the community structure become fully self-contained. Furthermore, we propose a local algorithm to detect communities which outperforms the existing algorithms with respect to computational cost, keeping the same level of reliability. The algorithm is tested on artificial and real-world graphs. In particular, we show how the algorithm applies to a network of scientific collaborations, which, for its size, cannot be attacked with the usual methods. This type of local algorithm could open the way to applications to large-scale technological and biological systems.},

We present an algorithm based on graph theory which allows determining how many and which measurement signals an attacker will attack in order to minimize his efforts in keeping the attack hidden from bad data detection. This provides guidance on which measurements are vulnerable and need increased protection.

abstract = {We consider the problem of maintaining an approximately maximum (fractional) matching and an approximately minimum vertex cover in a dynamic graph. Starting with the seminal paper by Onak and Rubinfeld [STOC 2010], this problem has received significant attention in recent years. There remains, however, a polynomial gap between the best known worst case update time and the best known amortised update time for this problem, even after allowing for randomisation. Specifically, Bernstein and Stein [ICALP 2015, SODA 2016] have the best known worst case update time. They present a deterministic data structure with approximation ratio {\$}(3/2+\backslashepsilon){\$} and worst case update time {\$}O(m{\^{}}{\{}1/4{\}}/\backslashepsilon{\^{}}2){\$}, where {\$}m{\$} is the number of edges in the graph. In recent past, Gupta and Peng [FOCS 2013] gave a deterministic data structure with approximation ratio {\$}(1+\backslashepsilon){\$} and worst case update time {\$}O(\backslashsqrt{\{}m{\}}/\backslashepsilon{\^{}}2){\$}. No known randomised data structure beats the worst case update times of these two results. In contrast, the paper by Onak and Rubinfeld [STOC 2010] gave a randomised data structure with approximation ratio {\$}O(1){\$} and amortised update time {\$}O(\backslashlog{\^{}}2 n){\$}, where {\$}n{\$} is the number of nodes in the graph. This was later improved by Baswana, Gupta and Sen [FOCS 2011] and Solomon [FOCS 2016], leading to a randomised date structure with approximation ratio {\$}2{\$} and amortised update time {\$}O(1){\$}. We bridge the polynomial gap between the worst case and amortised update times for this problem, without using any randomisation. We present a deterministic data structure with approximation ratio {\$}(2+\backslashepsilon){\$} and worst case update time {\$}O(\backslashlog{\^{}}3 n){\$}, for all sufficiently small constants {\$}\backslashepsilon{\$}.},

We empirically and theoretically show that the per-iteration cost of our algorithms is much less than [30], and our algorithms can be used to efficiently minimize a difference between submodular functions under various combinatorial constraints, a problem not previously addressed. We provide computational bounds and a hardness result on the mul- tiplicative inapproximability of minimizing the difference between submodular functions. We show, however, that it is possible to give worst-case additive bounds by providing a polynomial time computable lower-bound on the minima. Finally we show how a number of machine learning problems can be modeled as minimizing the difference between submodular functions.

abstract = {K{\"{o}}nig's theorem states that on bipartite graphs the size of a maximum matching equals the size of a minimum vertex cover. It is known from prior work that for every $\epsilon$ {\textgreater} 0 there exists a constant-time distributed algorithm that finds a (1+$\epsilon$)-approximation of a maximum matching on bounded-degree graphs. In this work, we show—somewhat surprisingly—that no sublogarithmic-time approximation scheme exists for the dual problem: there is a constant $\delta$ {\textgreater} 0 so that no randomised distributed algorithm with running time o(log n) can find a (1+$\delta$)-approximation of a minimum vertex cover on 2-coloured graphs of maximum degree 3. In fact, a simple application of the Linial–Saks (1993) decomposition demonstrates that this run-time lower bound is tight. Our lower-bound construction is simple and, to some extent, independent of previous techniques. Along the way we prove that a certain cut minimisation problem, which might be of independent interest, is hard to approximate locally on expander graphs.},

abstract = {The studies in fault-tolerance in networks mostly focus on the connectivity of the graph as the metric of fault-tolerance. If the underlying graph is k-connected, it can tolerate up to k - 1 failures. In measuring the fault tolerance in terms of connectivity, no assumption regarding the locations of the faulty nodes are made - the failed nodes may be close to each other or far from each other. In other words, the connectivity metric has no way of capturing the notion of locality of faults. However in many networks, faults may be highly localized. This is particularly true in military networks, where an enemy bomb may inflict massive but localized damage to the network. To capture the notion of locality of faults in a network, a new metric region-based connectivity (RBC) was introduced in. It was shown that RBC can achieve the same level of fault-tolerance as the metric connectivity, with much lower networking resources. The study in was restricted to single region fault model (SRFM), where faults are confined to one region only. In this paper, we extend the notion of RBC to multiple region fault model (MRFM), where faults are no longer confined to a single region. As faults in MRFM are still confined to regions, albeit multiple of them, it is different from unconstrained fault model where no constraint on locality of faults is imposed. The MRFM leads to several new concepts, such as region-disjoint paths and region cuts. We show that the classical result, the maximum number of node-disjoint paths between a pair of nodes is equal to the minimum number of nodes whose removal disconnects the pair, is no longer valid when region-disjoint paths and region cuts are considered. We prove that the problems of finding (i) the maximum number of region-disjoint paths between a pair of nodes, and (ii) minimum number of regions whose removal disconnect a pair of nodes, are both NP-complete. We provide heuristic solution to these two problems and evaluate their efficacy by compari-$\backslash$nng the results with optimal solutions.},

In this paper, we develop the first streaming and distributed solutions to this problem.

abstract = {The dramatic growth in practical applications for machine learning over the last ten years has been accompanied by many important developments in the underlying algorithms and techniques. For example, Bayesian methods have grown from a specialist niche to become mainstream, while graphical models have emerged as a general framework for describing and applying probabilistic techniques. The practical applicability of Bayesian methods has been greatly enhanced by the development of a range of approximate inference algorithms such as variational Bayes and expectation propagation, while new models based on kernels have had a significant impact on both algorithms and applications. This completely new textbook reflects these recent developments while providing a comprehensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first-year PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners. No previous knowledge of pattern recognition or machine learning concepts is assumed. Familiarity with multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and some experience in the use of probabilities would be helpful though not essential as the book includes a self-contained introduction to basic probability theory. The book is suitable for courses on machine learning, statistics, computer science, signal processing, computer vision, data mining, and bioinformatics. Extensive support is provided for course instructors, including more than 400 exercises, graded according to difficulty. Example solutions for a subset of the exercises are available from the book web site, while solutions for the remainder can be obtained by instructors from the publisher. The book is supported by a great deal of additional material, and the reader is encouraged to visit the book web site for the latest information. A forthcoming companion volume will deal with practical aspects of pattern recognition and machine learning, and will include free software implementations of the key algorithms along with example data sets and demonstration programs. Christopher Bishop is Assistant Director at Microsoft Research Cambridge, and also holds a Chair in Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh. He is a Fellow of Darwin College Cambridge, and was recently elected Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering.

abstract = {A fundamental problem in quality-of-service (QoS) routing is to find a path between a source-destination node pair that satisfies two or more end-to-end QoS constraints. We model this problem using a graph with n vertices and m edges with K additive QoS parameters associated with each edge, for any constant Kges2. This problem is known to be NP-hard. Fully polynomial time approximation schemes (FPTAS) for the case of K=2 have been reported in the literature. We concentrate on the general case and make the following contributions. 1) We present a very simple (Km+nlogn) time K-approximation algorithm that can be used in hop-by-hop routing protocols. 2) We present an FPTAS for one optimization version of the QoS routing problem with a time complexity of O(m(n/epsi){\textless}sup{\textgreater}K-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}). 3) We present an FPTAS for another optimization version of the QoS routing problem with a time complexity of O(nlogn+m(H/epsi){\textless}sup{\textgreater}K-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) when there exists an H-hop path satisfying all QoS constraints.

abstract = {When monitoring spatial phenomena, which can often be modeled as Gaussian processes (GPs), choosing sensor locations is a fundamental task. There are several common strategies to address this task, for example, geometry or disk models, placing sensors at the points of highest entropy (vari-ance) in the GP model, and A-, D-, or E-optimal design. In this paper, we tackle the combinatorial optimization problem of maximizing the mutual information between the chosen locations and the locations which are not selected. We prove that the problem of finding the configuration that max-imizes mutual information is NP-complete. To address this issue, we describe a polynomial-time approximation that is within (1 − 1/e) of the optimum by exploiting the submodularity of mutual information. We also show how submodularity can be used to obtain online bounds, and design branch and bound search procedures. We then extend our algorithm to exploit lazy evaluations and local structure in the GP, yielding significant speedups. We also extend our approach to find placements which are robust against node failures and uncertainties in the model. These extensions are again associated with rigorous theoretical approximation guarantees, exploiting the submodu-larity of the objective function. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach towards optimizing mutual information in a very extensive empirical study on two real-world data sets.},

abstract = {Propagation of contagion through networks is a fundamental process. It is used to model the spread of information, influence, or a viral infection. Diffusion patterns can be specified by a probabilistic model, such as Independent Cascade (IC), or captured by a set of representative traces. Basic computational problems in the study of diffusion are influence queries (determining the potency of a specified seed set of nodes) and Influence Maximization (identifying the most influential seed set of a given size). Answering each influence query involves many edge traversals, and does not scale when there are many queries on very large graphs. The gold standard for Influence Maximization is the greedy algorithm, which iteratively adds to the seed set a node maximizing the marginal gain in influence. Greedy has a guaranteed approximation ratio of at least (1-1/e) and actually produces a sequence of nodes, with each prefix having approximation guarantee with respect to the same-size optimum. Since Greedy does not scale well beyond a few million edges, for larger inputs one must currently use either heuristics or alternative algorithms designed for a pre-specified small seed set size. We develop a novel sketch-based design for influence computation. Our greedy Sketch-based Influence Maximization (SKIM) algorithm scales to graphs with billions of edges, with one to two orders of magnitude speedup over the best greedy methods. It still has a guaranteed approximation ratio, and in practice its quality nearly matches that of exact greedy. We also present influence oracles, which use linear-time preprocessing to generate a small sketch for each node, allowing the influence of any seed set to be quickly answered from the sketches of its nodes.},

Although algorithms that can assemble a large amount of RNA-Seq data are available, they are generally very memory-intensive and can only be used to construct small assemblies. We develop a divide-and-conquer strategy that allows these algorithms to be utilized, by subdividing a large RNA-Seq data set into small libraries. Each individual library is assembled independently by an existing algorithm, and a merging algorithm is developed to combine these assemblies by picking a subset of high quality transcripts to form a large transcriptome. When compared to existing algorithms that return a single assembly directly, this strategy achieves comparable or increased accuracy as memory-efficient algorithms that can be used to process a large amount of RNA-Seq data, and comparable or decreased accuracy as memory-intensive algorithms that can only be used to construct small assemblies.

In heart failure, cardiac output (supply) is decreased due to pathologic remodeling of the heart. To meet the demands of the body, the sympathetic system is activated and catecholamines stimulate $\beta$-adrenergic receptors ($\beta$-ARs) to increase contractile performance and cardiac output.

abstract = {A key ingredient in social contagion dynamics is reinforcement, as adopting a certain social behavior requires verification of its credibility and legitimacy. Memory of nonredundant information plays an important role in reinforcement, which so far has eluded theoretical analysis. We first propose a general social contagion model with reinforcement derived from nonredundant information memory. Then, we develop a unified edge-based compartmental theory to analyze this model, and a remarkable agreement with numerics is obtained on some specific models. We use a spreading threshold model as a specific example to understand the memory effect, in which each individual adopts a social behavior only when the cumulative pieces of information that the individual received from his or her neighbors exceeds an adoption threshold. Through analysis and numerical simulations, we find that the memory characteristic markedly affects the dynamics as quantified by the final adoption size. Strikingly, we uncover a transition phenomenon in which the dependence of the final adoption size on some key parameters, such as the transmission probability, can change from being discontinuous to being continuous. The transition can be triggered by proper parameters and structural perturbations to the system, such as decreasing individuals' adoption threshold, increasing initial seed size, or enhancing the network heterogeneity.},

abstract = {Given a graph {\$}G=(V,E){\$} with two distinguished vertices {\$}s,t\backslashin V{\$} and an integer parameter {\$}L{\textgreater}0{\$}, an {\$}L{\$}-bounded cut is a subset {\$}F{\$} of edges (nodes) such that the every path between {\$}s{\$} and {\$}t{\$} in {\$}G\backslashsetminus F{\$} has length more than {\$}L{\$}. The task is to find an {\$}L{\$}-bounded cut of minimum cardinality. Though the problem is very simple to state and has been studied since the beginning of the 70's, it is not much understood yet. The problem is known to be {\$}\backslashcal{\{}NP{\}}{\$}-hard to approximate within a small constant factor even for {\$}L\backslashgeq 4{\$} (for {\$}L\backslashgeq 5{\$} for the node cuts). On the other hand, the best known approximation algorithm for general graphs has approximation ratio only {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}O{\}}({\{}n{\^{}}{\{}2/3{\}}{\}}){\$} in the edge case, and {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}O{\}}({\{}\backslashsqrt{\{}n{\}}{\}}){\$} in the node case, where {\$}n{\$} denotes the number of nodes. We show that for planar graphs, it is possible to solve both the edge- and the node-version of the problem optimally in time {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}O{\}}(L{\^{}}{\{}3L{\}}n){\$}. That is, the problem is fixed parameter tractable (FPT) with respect to {\$}L{\$} on planar graphs. Furthermore, we show that the problem remains FPT even for bounded genus graphs, a super class of planar graphs. Our second contribution is an {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}O{\}}(\backslashtau\backslashsqrt{\{}\backslashlog \backslashtau{\}}\backslashlog n){\$}-approximation algorithm for the node version of the problem on graphs with treewidth bounded by {\$}\backslashtau{\$}. For graphs with treewidth bounded by {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}O{\}}(n{\^{}}{\{}1/2-\backslashepsilon{\}}){\$} for any {\$}\backslashepsilon{\textgreater}0{\$}, but not by a constant, this is the best approximation in terms of{\~{}}{\$}n{\$} that we are aware of.},

abstract = {Many complex systems can be represented as networks consisting of distinct types of interactions, which can be categorized as links belonging to different layers. For example, a good description of the full protein-protein interactome requires, for some organisms, up to seven distinct network layers, accounting for different genetic and physical interactions, each containing thousands of protein-protein relationships. A fundamental open question is then how many layers are indeed necessary to accurately represent the structure of a multilayered complex system. Here we introduce a method based on quantum theory to reduce the number of layers to a minimum while maximizing the distinguishability between the multilayer network and the corresponding aggregated graph. We validate our approach on synthetic benchmarks and we show that the number of informative layers in some real multilayer networks of protein-genetic interactions, social, economical and transportation systems can be reduced by up to 75{\%}.},

abstract = { Image retrieval is a common problem in many computer vision applications and the literature abounds with techniques with impressive retrieval accuracies. Several of these techniques use probability distributions to represent the "objects" they intend to retrieve. We present a novel approach to search such collections of distributions efficiently. Like many standard data structures, our method uses an "average" to represent a large set (Le., cluster) of objects, thus allowing the search to disregard an unpromising subset with only one comparison to its average. Our contribution lies in choosing the average: Inspired by information theory, we choose a representative that is optimally "close" in a minimax sense to all members of its set when measured using the Kullback-Liebler (KL) divergence. We present a texture retrieval system and test it on the CUReT database, measuring accuracy and efficiency. We find that using the KL-center yields speed ups of more than a factor of three over an exhaustive search while guaranteeing identical accuracy. The KL-center also out-performs other commonly used representatives such as the arithmetic mean. Although we present results only in texture retrieval, our approach will likely aid image and shape retrieval as well.},

abstract = {Low-rank representation (LRR) is an effective method for subspace clustering and has found wide applications in computer vision and machine learning. The existing LRR solver is based on the alternating direction method (ADM). It suffers from {\$}O(n{\^{}}3){\$} computation complexity due to the matrix-matrix multiplications and matrix inversions, even if partial SVD is used. Moreover, introducing auxiliary variables also slows down the convergence. Such a heavy computation load prevents LRR from large scale applications. In this paper, we generalize ADM by linearizing the quadratic penalty term and allowing the penalty to change adaptively. We also propose a novel rule to update the penalty such that the convergence is fast. With our linearized ADM with adaptive penalty (LADMAP) method, it is unnecessary to introduce auxiliary variables and invert matrices. The matrix-matrix multiplications are further alleviated by using the skinny SVD representation technique. As a result, we arrive at an algorithm for LRR with complexity {\$}O(rn{\^{}}2){\$}, where {\$}r{\$} is the rank of the representation matrix. Numerical experiments verify that for LRR our LADMAP method is much faster than state-of-the-art algorithms. Although we only present the results on LRR, LADMAP actually can be applied to solving more general convex programs.},

abstract = {As a generation of the classical percolation, clique percolation focuses on the connection of cliques in a graph, where the connection of two {\$}k{\$}-cliques means that they share at least {\$}l{\textless}k{\$} vertices. In this paper, we develop a theoretical approach to study clique percolation in Erd$\backslash$H{\{}o{\}}s-R$\backslash$'{\{}e{\}}nyi graphs, which gives not only the exact solutions of the critical point, but also the corresponding order parameter. Based on this, we prove theoretically that the fraction {\$}\backslashpsi{\$} of cliques in the giant clique cluster always makes a continuous phase transition as the classical percolation. However, the fraction {\$}\backslashphi{\$} of vertices in the giant clique cluster for {\$}l{\textgreater}1{\$} makes a step-function-like discontinuous phase transition in the thermodynamic limit and a continuous phase transition for {\$}l=1{\$}. More interesting, our analysis shows that at the critical point, the order parameter {\$}\backslashphi{\_}c{\$} for {\$}l{\textgreater}1{\$} is neither {\$}0{\$} nor {\$}1{\$}, but a constant depending on {\$}k{\$} and {\$}l{\$}.

Instead, they all assumed known rates (either constants or drawn from known distributions) for influence propagation models. However, such models cannot correctly describe influence diffusion in reality. In this paper, we propose a novel model, Dynamic Influence Propagation (DIP), that allows propagation rate to change during the diffusion, based on which we define a new problem: Threshold Activation Problem under DIP (TAP-DIP), which adds another layer of complexity over the already $\backslash${\#}P-Hard TAP problem. Despite the hardness of TAP-DIP, we are able to design a Lipschitz Optimization scheme (LOS) that can solve TAP-DIP with {\$}O(\backslashlog|V|){\$} ratio where {\$}V{\$} is the set of nodes in the OSN. Using various real OSN datasets, we experimentally demonstrate that LOS not only generates high-quality yet much smaller seed sets when being aware of the rate increase, but also scalable.},

Furthermore, several interesting graph mining applications rely on computing the number of triangles in the graph of interest. In this paper, we focus on the problem of counting triangles in a graph. We propose a practical method, out of which all triangle counting algorithms can potentially benefit. Using a straightforward triangle counting algorithm as a black box, we performed 166 experiments on real-world networks and on synthetic datasets as well, where we show that our method works with high accuracy, typically more than 99{\%} and gives significant speedups, resulting in even 130 times faster performance.},

Suppose that we observe m entries selected uniformly at random from a matrix M. Can we complete the matrix and recover the entries that we have not seen? We show that one can perfectly recover most low-rank matrices from what appears to be an incomplete set of entries. We prove that if the number m of sampled entries obeys m {\textgreater}= C n{\^{}}{\{}1.2{\}} r log n for some positive numerical constant C, then with very high probability, most n by n matrices of rank r can be perfectly recovered by solving a simple convex optimization program. This program finds the matrix with minimum nuclear norm that fits the data. The condition above assumes that the rank is not too large. However, if one replaces the 1.2 exponent with 1.25, then the result holds for all values of the rank. Similar results hold for arbitrary rectangular matrices as well. Our results are connected with the recent literature on compressed sensing, and show that objects other than signals and images can be perfectly reconstructed from very limited information.},

While pure topological analyzes from a network security perspective provide some effective techniques, their inability to characterize the physical principles requires a more comprehensive model to approximate failure behavior of a complex network in reality. In this paper, based on an extended topological metric, we proposed an approach to examine the vulnerability of a specific type of complex network, i.e., the power system, against cascading failure threats. The proposed approach adopts a model called extended betweenness that combines network structure with electrical characteristics to define the load of power grid components. By using this power transfer distribution factor-based model, we simulated attacks on different components (buses and branches) in the grid and evaluated the vulnerability of the system components with an extended topological cascading failure simulator. Influence of different loading and overloading situations on cascading failures was also evaluated by testing different tolerance factors. Simulation results from a standard IEEE 118-bus test system revealed the vulnerability of network components, which was then validated on a dc power flow simulator with comparisons to other topological measurements. Finally, potential extensions of the approach were also discussed to exhibit both utility and challenge in more complex scenarios and applications.},

The proposed method is called improved ant colony optimizations (IACO) which introduces two addition techniques in order to improve the search process, i.e. neighborhood search and re-initialization process. To show its efficiency, IACO is applied to test with three different topology network systems and its results are compared with those obtained results from the conventional approaches, i.e. genetic algorithm (GA), tabu search algorithm (TSA) and ACO. Simulation results, obtained these test problems with various constraints, shown that the proposed approach is superior to the conventional algorithms both solution quality and computational time. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We address the algorithmic problem of finding a set of k initial seed nodes in a network so that the expected size of the resulting cascade is maximized, under the standard independent cascade model of network diffusion. Runtime is a primary consideration for this problem due to the massive size of the relevant input networks. We provide a fast algorithm for the influence maximization problem, obtaining the near-optimal approximation factor of (1 - 1/e - epsilon), for any epsilon {\textgreater} 0, in time O((m+n)log(n) / epsilon{\^{}}3). Our algorithm is runtime-optimal (up to a logarithmic factor) and substantially improves upon the previously best-known algorithms which run in time Omega(mnk POLY(1/epsilon)). Furthermore, our algorithm can be modified to allow early termination: if it is terminated after O(beta(m+n)log(n)) steps for some beta {\textless} 1 (which can depend on n), then it returns a solution with approximation factor O(beta). Finally, we show that this runtime is optimal (up to logarithmic factors) for any beta and fixed seed size k.},

abstract = {For every known NP-complete problem, the number of solutions of its instances varies over a large range, from zero to exponentially many. It is therefore natural to ask if the inherent intractability of NP-complete problem is caused by this wide variation. We give a negative answer to this question using the notion of randomized polynomial time reducibility. We show that the problems of distinguishing between instances of SAT having zero or one solution, or of finding solutions to instances of SAT having a unique solution, are as hard as SAT, under randomized reductions. Several corollaries about the difficulty of specific problems follow. For example, computing the parity of the number of solutions of a SAT formula is shown to be NP-hard, and deciding if a SAT formula has a unique solution is shown to be Dp-hard, under randomized reduction. Central to the study of cryptography is the question as to whether there exist NP-problems whose instances have solutions that are unique but are hard to find. Our result can be interpreted as strengthening the belief that such problems exist. ?? 1986.},

@article{Grubesic2008,
abstract = {A common theme in analysis and evaluation of network-based critical infrastructure is the assessment of system vulnerability. Graph theoretic, simulation, and optimization-based techniques have played a significant role in examining potential network vulnerabilities given the insights they can provide for mitigating facility loss and prioritizing fortification efforts. Central to these approaches is the concept of facility (arc—node) importance or criticality to system survivability. Assessments of network vulnerability can dramatically differ based on how facility importance is characterized. In this review, various approaches for assessing facility importance and network vulnerability are examined. The key differences in these approaches are the ways in which a facility's role in maintaining network operability is evaluated given arc—node disruption. Comparative results suggest significant differences exist among measures of facility importance and network performance. Furthermore, the subsequent incongruities in these measures and their implications need to be clearly understood to support interdiction risk and vulnerability assessment for critical infrastructures.},

These results improve on prior work by Candes and Recht, Candes and Tao, and Keshavan, Montanari, and Oh. The reconstruction is accomplished by minimizing the nuclear norm, or sum of the singular values, of the hidden matrix subject to agreement with the provided entries. If the underlying matrix satisfies a certain incoherence condition, then the number of entries required is equal to a quadratic logarithmic factor times the number of parameters in the singular value decomposition. The proof of this assertion is short, self contained, and uses very elementary analysis. The novel techniques herein are based on recent work in quantum information theory.},

abstract = {In this work, we propose a novel information theoretic framework for dictionary learning (DL) and sparse coding (SC) on a statistical manifold (the manifold of probability distributions). Unlike the traditional DL and SC framework, our new formulation {\{}$\backslash$it does not explicitly incorporate any sparsity inducing norm in the cost function but yet yields SCs{\}}. Moreover, we extend this framework to the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices, {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}P{\}}{\_}n{\$}. Our algorithm approximates the data points, which are probability distributions, by the weighted Kullback-Leibeler center (KL-center) of the dictionary atoms. The KL-center is the minimizer of the maximum KL-divergence between the unknown center and members of the set whose center is being sought. Further, {\{}$\backslash$it we proved that this KL-center is a sparse combination of the dictionary atoms{\}}. Since, the data reside on a statistical manifold, the data fidelity term can not be as simple as in the case of the vector-space data. We therefore employ the geodesic distance between the data and a sparse approximation of the data element. This cost function is minimized using an acceleterated gradient descent algorithm. An extensive set of experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed framework. We present several experiments involving a variety of classification problems in Computer Vision applications. Further, we demonstrate the performance of our algorithm by comparing it to several state-of-the-art methods both in terms of classification accuracy and sparsity.},

abstract = {Most community detection methods use network topology and edge density to identify optimal communities. However, in these methods, several objects that are connected by high weights may be decomposed into different communities, even when they intuitively belong to a single community. In this case, it is more effective to classify the objects into the same community because they perform important roles in controlling and understanding the network. To achieve this goal, in this paper, we propose a method of detecting optimal community structures in a complex network using interaction-based edge clustering. Our approach is to consider network topology as well as interaction density when identifying overlapping and hierarchical communities. Additionally, we measure the differences between the quantity and quality of intra- and inter-community interactions to evaluate the quality of the community structure. We test our method on several benchmark networks with known community structures. Additionally, after applying our method to several real-world complex networks, we evaluate our method through comparison with other methods. We find that the community quality and the overlap quality for our method surpass the results of the other methods.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The spreading of behavior, such as the adoption of a new innovation, is influenced by the structure of social networks that interconnect the population. In the experiments of Centola [15], adoption of new behavior was shown to spread further and faster across clustered-lattice networks than across corresponding random networks. This implies that the “complex contagion” effects of social reinforcement are important in such diffusion, in contrast to “simple” contagion models of disease-spread which predict that epidemics would grow more efficiently on random networks than on clustered networks. To accurately model complex contagion on clustered networks remains a challenge because the usual assumptions (e.g., of mean-field theory) regarding tree-like networks are invalidated by the presence of triangles in the network; the triangles are, however, crucial to the social reinforcement mechanism, which posits an increased probability of a person adopting behavior that has been adopted by two or more neighbors. In this paper we modify the analytical approach that was introduced by H{\'{e}}bert-Dufresne et al. [19], to study disease-spread on clustered networks. We show how the approximation method can be adapted to a complex contagion model, and confirm the accuracy of the method with numerical simulations. The analytical results of the model enable us to quantify the level of social reinforcement that is required to observe—as in Centola's experiments—faster diffusion on clustered topologies than on random networks.},

The misinformation containment problem aims at limiting the spread of misinformation in online social networks by launching competing campaigns. Motivated by realistic scenarios, we present the first analysis of the misinformation containment problem for the case when an arbitrary number of cascades are allowed. This paper makes four contributions. First, we provide a formal model for multi-cascade diffusion and introduce an important concept called as cascade priority. Second, we show that the misinformation containment problem cannot be approximated within a factor of {\$}\backslashOmega(2{\^{}}{\{}\backslashlog{\^{}}{\{}1-\backslashepsilon{\}}n{\^{}}4{\}}){\$} in polynomial time unless {\$}NP \backslashsubseteq DTIME(n{\^{}}{\{}\backslashpolylog{\{}n{\}}{\}}){\$}. Third, we introduce several types of cascade priority that are frequently seen in real social networks. Finally, we design novel algorithms for solving the misinformation containment problem. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is supported by encouraging experimental results.},

We consider the problem {\$}\backslashmax{\_}{\{}S \backslashin \backslashcal I{\}} f(S){\$}. It is known that the greedy algorithm yields a 1/2-approximation [9] for this problem.

In this paper, we improve the 1/2-approximation to a (1 {\"{i}}¾¿ 1/e)-approximation, when fis a sum of weighted rank functions of matroids. This class of functions captures a number of interesting problems including set coverage type problems. Our main tools are the pipage rounding technique of Ageev and Sviridenko [1] and a probabilistic lemma on monotone submodular functions that might be of independent interest. We show that the generalized assignment problem (GAP) is a special case of our problem; although the reduction requires |N| to be exponential in the original problem size, we are able to interpret the recent (1 {\"{i}}¾¿ 1/e)-approximation for GAP by Fleischer et al.[10] in our framework. This enables us to obtain a (1 {\"{i}}¾¿ 1/e)-approximation for variants of GAP with more complex constraints.},

abstract = {We study the parameterized complexity of two families of problems: the bounded length disjoint paths problem and the bounded length cut problem. From Menger's theorem both problems are equivalent (and computationally easy) in the unbounded case for single source, single target paths. However, in the bounded case, they are combinatorially distinct and are both NP-hard, even to approximate. Our results indicate that a more refined landscape appears when we study these problems with respect to their parameterized complexity. For this, we consider several parameterizations (with respect to the maximum length l of paths, the number k of paths or the size of a cut, and the treewidth of the input graph) of all variants of both problems (edge/vertex-disjoint paths or cuts, directed/undirected). We provide FPT-algorithms (for all variants) when parameterized by both k and l and hardness results when the parameter is only one of k and l. Our results indicate that the bounded length disjoint-path variants are structurally harder than their bounded length cut counterparts. Also, it appears that the edge variants are harder than their vertex-disjoint counterparts when parameterized by the treewidth of the input graph. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The community detection problem in networks consists of determining a clustering of "related" vertices in a graph or network. Nowadays, studies involving this problem are primarily composed of modularity maximization based heuristics. In this paper, the author proposes a spectral heuristic based on a measure known as clustering coefficient to detect communities in networks. This measure favors clusterings with a strong neighborhood structure inside clusters, apparently, overcoming the scale deficiency of the modularity maximization problem. The computational experiments indicate a very successful performance by the proposed heuristic in comparison with other community detection heuristics in the literature. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Low latency analytics on geographically distributed dat- asets (across datacenters, edge clusters) is an upcoming and increasingly important challenge. The dominant approach of aggregating all the data to a single data- center significantly inflates the timeliness of analytics. At the same time, running queries over geo-distributed inputs using the current intra-DC analytics frameworks also leads to high query response times because these frameworks cannot cope with the relatively low and variable capacity of WAN links. We present Iridium, a system for low latency geo-distri- buted analytics. Iridium achieves low query response times by optimizing placement of both data and tasks of the queries. The joint data and task placement op- timization, however, is intractable. Therefore, Iridium uses an online heuristic to redistribute datasets among the sites prior to queries' arrivals, and places the tasks to reduce network bottlenecks during the query's ex- ecution. Finally, it also contains a knob to budget WAN usage. Evaluation across eight worldwide EC2 re- gions using production queries show that Iridium speeds up queries by 3× − 19× and lowers WAN usage by 15{\%}−64{\%} compared to existing baselines.},

abstract = {In this paper, we focus on the efficient and scalable processing of setreachability queries over a distributed, directed data graph. A setreachability query is a generalized form of a reachability query, in which we consider two sets S and T of source and target vertices, respectively, to be given as the query. The result of a setreachability query are all pairs of source and target vertices (s, t), with s ∈ S and t ∈ T , where s is reachable to t (denoted as S ; T). In case the data graph is partitioned into multiple, edgeand vertexdisjoint subgraphs (e.g., when distributed across multiple compute nodes in a cluster), we refer to the resulting setreachability problem as distributed set reachability. The key goal in processing a distributed setreachability query over a partitioned data graph both efficiently and in a scalable manner is (1) to avoid redundant computations within the local compute nodes as much as possible, (2) to partially evaluate the local components of a setreachability query S ; T among all compute nodes in parallel, and (3) to minimize both the size and number of messages exchanged among the compute nodes. Distributed set reachability has a plethora of applications in graph analytics and for query processing. The current W3C recommendation for SPARQL 1.1, for example, introduces a notion of labeled property paths which resolves to processing a form of generalized graphpattern queries with setreachability predicates. Moreover, analyzing dependencies among socialnetwork communities inherently involves reachability checks between large sets of source and target vertices. Our experiments confirm very significant performance gains of our approach in comparison to stateoftheart graph engines such as Giraph ++ , and over a variety of graph collections with up to 1.4 billion edges.},

abstract = {Human genetic studies have recently suggested that the postsynaptic activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc) complex is a convergence signal for several genes implicated in schizophrenia. However, the functional significance of Arc in schizophrenia-related neurobehavioral phenotypes and brain circuits is unclear. Here, we find that, consistent with schizophrenia-related phenotypes, disruption of Arc in mice produces deficits in sensorimotor gating, cognitive functions, social behaviors, and amphetamine-induced psychomotor responses. Furthermore, genetic disruption of Arc leads to concomitant hypoactive mesocortical and hyperactive mesostriatal dopamine pathways. Application of a D1 agonist to the prefrontal cortex or a D2 antagonist in the ventral striatum rescues Arc-dependent cognitive or psychomotor abnormalities, respectively. Our findings demonstrate a role for Arc in the regulation of dopaminergic neurotransmission and related behaviors. The results also provide initial biological support implicating Arc in dopaminergic and behavioral abnormalities related to schizophrenia.

Our theory accurately predicts how many copies of any nucleotide are expected inside each such cluster, and how an elegant and precise LCP array based procedure can locate these clusters in the eBWT. Our findings are very general and can be applied to a wide range of different problems. In this paper, we consider the case of alignment-free and reference-free SNPs discovery in multiple collections of reads. We note that, in accordance with our theoretical results, SNPs are clustered in the eBWT of the reads collection, and we develop a tool finding SNPs with a simple scan of the eBWT and LCP arrays. Preliminary results show that our method requires much less coverage than state-of-the-art tools while drastically improving precision and sensitivity.},

In addition to its influence on search result quality, the size of the indexed Web can also tell us something about which parts of the WWW are directly accessible to the everyday user. We propose a novel method of estimating the size of a Web search engine's index by extrapolating from document frequencies of words observed in a large static corpus of Web pages. In addition, we provide a unique longitudinal perspective on the size of Google and Bing's indices over a nine-year period, from March 2006 until January 2015. We find that index size estimates of these two search engines tend to vary dramatically over time, with Google generally possessing a larger index than Bing. This result raises doubts about the reliability of previous one-off estimates of the size of the indexed Web. We find that much, if not all of this variability can be explained by changes in the indexing and ranking infrastructure of Google and Bing. This casts further doubt on whether Web search engines can be used reliably for cross-sectional webometric studies.},

As existing approximation algorithms for this NP-hard problem either do not scale well to massive networks or have poor solution quality, we formulate two algorithms, TARL and DART, with worst-case guarantees 5/2 and 3 with respect to optimal, respectively. Furthermore, DART is able to efficiently maintain its worst-case guarantee under dynamic edge insertion and removal to the network. In our comprehensive experimental evaluation, we demonstrate that DART is able to run on networks with billions of triangles within 2 hours and is able to dynamically update its solution in microseconds.},

This finding reveals an intriguing paradox7, 8: if natural systems organize in interconnected networks, how can they be so stable? Here we provide a solution to this conundrum, showing that the stability of a system of networks relies on the relation between the internal structure of a network and its pattern of connections to other networks. Specifically, we demonstrate that if interconnections are provided by network hubs, and the connections between networks are moderately convergent, the system of networks is stable and robust to failure. We test this theoretical prediction on two independent experiments of functional brain networks (in task and resting states), which show that brain networks are connected with a topology that maximizes stability according to the theory},

abstract = {Long-Term Evolution (LTE) allows operators to use new and wider spectrum and complements 3G networks with higher data rates, lower latency and a flat IP-based architecture. To further improve broadband user experience in a ubiquitous and cost effective manner, 3GPP has been working on various aspects in the framework of LTE Advanced. Since radio link performance is approaching theoretical limits with 3G enhancements and LTE, the next performance leap in wireless networks will come from the network topology. LTE Advanced is about improving spectral efficiency per unit area. Using a mix of macro, pico, femto and relay base-stations, heterogeneous networks enable flexible and low-cost deployments and provide a uniform broadband experience to users anywhere in the network. This paper discusses the need for an alternative deployment model or topology using heterogeneous networks. To enhance the performance of these networks, advanced techniques are described which are needed to manage and control interference and deliver the full benefits of such networks. Range extension allows more user terminals to benefit directly from low-power base-stations such as picos, femtos, and relays. Adaptive inter-cell interference coordination provides smart resource allocation amongst interfering cells and improves inter-cell fairness in a heterogeneous network. In addition, the performance gains with heterogeneous networks using an example macro/pico network are shown.},

abstract = {Cognitive radio is a promising technology aiming to improve the utilization of the radio electromagnetic spectrum. A cognitive radio device uses general purpose computer processors that run radio applications software to perform signal processing. The use of this software enables the device to sense and understand its environment and actively change its mode of operation based on its observations. Unfortunately, this solution entails new security challenges. Our objective in this paper is to analyze the security issues of the main recent developments and architectures of cognitive radio networks. We present vulnerabilities inherent to those systems, identify novel types of abuse, classify attacks, and analyze their impact on the operation of cognitive radio-based systems. Moreover, we discuss and propose security solutions to mitigate such threats. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2010 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

Military applications such as Blue Force Tracking, inter-team communications, remote unmanned vehicle control, and sensor data mining/fusion thus have to deal with unstable links with limited bandwidth and variable latency. The peculiar characteristics of tactical networks call for peer-to-peer approaches to realize complex, adaptive, and fault-tolerant applications to be deployed in the battlefield. This article reports on our observations from several tactical networking experiments in which we have deployed state-of-the-art applications and services that leverage P2P communications. More specifically, we discuss why P2P approaches are critical for tactical network environments and applications. We then analyze the requirements that should be satisfied by P2P middleware for tactical environments. Finally, we discuss a case study, the Agile Computing Middleware, and present experimental results that demonstrate its effectiveness.},

While there are strong theoretical guarantees on the performance of Greedy for maximizing submodular functions, there are few guarantees for non-submodular ones. However, Greedy enjoys strong empirical performance for many important non-submodular functions, e.g., the Bayesian A-optimality objective in experimental design. We prove theoretical guarantees supporting the empirical performance. Our guarantees are characterized by the (generalized) submodularity ratio {\$}\backslashgamma{\$} and the (generalized) curvature {\$}\backslashalpha{\$}. In particular, we prove that Greedy enjoys a tight approximation guarantee of {\$}\backslashfrac{\{}1{\}}{\{}\backslashalpha{\}}(1- e{\^{}}{\{}-\backslashgamma\backslashalpha{\}}){\$} for cardinality constrained maximization. In addition, we bound the submodularity ratio and curvature for several important real-world objectives, e.g., the Bayesian A-optimality objective, the determinantal function of a square submatrix and certain linear programs with combinatorial constraints. We experimentally validate our theoretical findings for several real-world applications.},

While previous studies assumed a noise-free environment or a noisy monotone submodular objective function, this paper considers a more realistic and general situation where the evaluation of a subset is a noisy monotone function (not necessarily submodular), with both multiplicative and additive noises. To understand the impact of the noise, we firstly show the approximation ratio of the greedy algorithm and POSS, two powerful algorithms for noise-free subset selection, in the noisy environments. We then propose to incorporate a noise-aware strategy into POSS, resulting in the new PONSS algorithm. We prove that PONSS can achieve a better approximation ratio under some assumption such as i.i.d. noise distribution. The empirical results on influence maximization and sparse regression problems show the superior performance of PONSS.},

abstract = {How to assess the topology vulnerability of a network has attracted more and more attentions recently. Due to the rapid growing number of real-time internet applications developed since the last decade, the discovery of topology weakness related to its quality of service (QoS) is of more interest. In this paper, we provide a novel QoS-aware measurement for assessing the vulnerability of general network topologies. Specifically, we evaluate the vulnerability by detecting the minimum number of link failures that decrease the satisfactory level of the QoS-Optimal source-destination path to a given value, which means a topology with a smaller amount of such link failures is more vulnerable. We formulate this process as a graph optimization problem called QoSCE and provide several exact and heuristic algorithms for various QoS constraint amounts. To our best knowledge, this is the first graph-theoretical framework to evaluate QoS-aware topology vulnerability. Through extensive simulations, the performance of the proposed algorithms are validated in terms of assessment accuracy and time complexity.},

abstract = {We study the power of fractional allocations of resources to maximize influence in a network. This work extends in a natural way the well-studied model by Kempe, Kleinberg, and Tardos (2003), where a designer selects a (small) seed set of nodes in a social network to influence directly, this influence cascades when other nodes reach certain thresholds of neighbor influence, and the goal is to maximize the final number of influenced nodes. Despite extensive study from both practical and theoretical viewpoints, this model limits the designer to a binary choice for each node, with no way to apply intermediate levels of influence. This model captures some settings precisely, e.g. exposure to an idea or pathogen, but it fails to capture very relevant concerns in others, for example, a manufacturer promoting a new product by distributing five "20{\%} off" coupons instead of giving away one free product. While fractional versions of problems tend to be easier to solve than integral versions, for influence maximization, we show that the two versions have essentially the same computational complexity. On the other hand, the two versions can have vastly different solutions: the added flexibility of fractional allocation can lead to significantly improved influence. Our main theoretical contribution is to show how to adapt the major positive results from the integral case to the fractional case. Specifically, Mossel and Roch (2006) used the submodularity of influence to obtain their integral results; we introduce a new notion of continuous submodularity, and use this to obtain matching fractional results. We conclude that we can achieve the same greedy {\$}(1-1/e-\backslashepsilon){\$}-approximation for the fractional case as the integral case. In practice, we find that the fractional model performs substantially better than the integral model, according to simulations on real-world social network data.},

Here, we formulate the problem of inferring latent social networks based on network diffusion or disease propagation data. We consider contagions propagating over the edges of an unobserved social network, where we only observe the times when nodes became infected, but not who infected them. Given such node infection times, we then identify the optimal network that best explains the observed data. We present a maximum likelihood approach based on convex programming with a l1-like penalty term that encourages sparsity. Experiments on real and synthetic data reveal that our method near-perfectly recovers the underlying network structure as well as the parameters of the contagion propagation model. Moreover, our approach scales well as it can infer optimal networks of thousands of nodes in a matter of minutes.},

Half of the names had previously been judged to be of high familiarity (e.g., Gwyneth Paltrow), and half were of lower familiarity (e.g., Billy Bob Thornton). The results showed that when in a tip-of-the-tongue (TOT) state, the participants were able to estimate at above-chance rates whether a celebrity's name comprised two or three words. Accurate information about the number of words was not available to the participants unless they were in a TOT state or had already named the person. Attempts to identify celebrities whose name had three elements were associated with an increased number of TOTs, relative to celebrities whose name had two units, but there was no difference in the number of don't know responses for names containing two or three words. Calculations based on Gollan and Brown (2006) suggested that having three names impaired the phonological but not the semantic stage of lexical retrieval, whereas low familiarity impaired both semantic and phonological retrieval stages.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is well understood that distinct communities of bacteria are present at different sites of the body, and that changes in the structure of these communities have strong implications for human health. Yet, challenges remain in understanding the complex interconnections between the bacterial taxa within these microbial communities and how they change during the progression of diseases. Many recent studies attempt to analyze the human microbiome using traditional ecological measures and cataloging differences in bacterial community membership. In this paper, we show how to push metagenomic analyses beyond mundane questions related to the bacterial taxonomic profiles that differentiate one sample from another.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We develop tools and techniques that help us to investigate the nature of social interactions in microbial communities, and demonstrate ways of compactly capturing extensive information about these networks and visually conveying them in an effective manner. We define the concept of bacterial "social clubs", which are groups of taxa that tend to appear together in many samples. More importantly, we define the concept of "rival clubs", entire groups that tend to avoid occurring together in many samples. We show how to efficiently compute social clubs and rival clubs and demonstrate their utility with the help of examples including a smokers' dataset and a dataset from the Human Microbiome Project (HMP).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The tools developed provide a framework for analyzing relationships between bacterial taxa modeled as bacterial co-occurrence networks. The computational techniques also provide a framework for identifying clubs and rival clubs and for studying differences in the microbiomes (and their interactions) of two or more collections of samples.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Microbial relationships are similar to those found in social networks. In this work, we assume that strong (positive or negative) tendencies to co-occur or co-infect is likely to have biological, physiological, or ecological significance, possibly as a result of cooperation or competition. As a consequence of the analysis, a variety of biological interpretations are conjectured. In the human microbiome context, the pattern of strength of interactions between bacterial taxa is unique to body site.},

Despite that several individual-level diffusion data have been investigated, we still lack the detailed understanding of the spreading pattern of information. Here, by comparing information flows and social links in a blog community, we find that the diffusion processes are induced by three different spreading mechanisms: social spreading, self-promotion and broadcast. Although numerous previous studies have employed epidemic spreading models to simulate information diffusion, we observe that such models fail to reproduce the realistic diffusion pattern. In respect to users behaviors, strikingly, we find that most users would stick to one specific diffusion mechanism. Moreover, our observations indicate that the social spreading is not only crucial for the structure of diffusion trees, but also capable of inducing more subsequent individuals to acquire the information. Our findings suggest new directions for modeling of information diffusion in social systems, and could inform design of efficient propagation strategies based on users behaviors.},

abstract = {Indexing highly repetitive texts --- such as genomic databases, software repositories and versioned text collections --- has become an important problem since the turn of the millennium. A relevant compressibility measure for repetitive texts is {\$}r{\$}, the number of runs in their Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT). One of the earliest indexes for repetitive collections, the Run-Length FM-index, used {\$}O(r){\$} space and was able to efficiently count the number of occurrences of a pattern of length {\$}m{\$} in the text (in loglogarithmic time per pattern symbol, with current techniques). However, it was unable to locate the positions of those occurrences efficiently within a space bounded in terms of {\$}r{\$}. Since then, a number of other indexes with space bounded by other measures of repetitiveness --- the number of phrases in the Lempel-Ziv parse, the size of the smallest grammar generating the text, the size of the smallest automaton recognizing the text factors --- have been proposed for efficiently locating, but not directly counting, the occurrences of a pattern. In this paper we close this long-standing problem, showing how to extend the Run-Length FM-index so that it can locate the {\$}occ{\$} occurrences efficiently within {\$}O(r){\$} space (in loglogarithmic time each), and reaching optimal time {\$}O(m+occ){\$} within {\$}O(r\backslashlog(n/r)){\$} space, on a RAM machine of {\$}w=\backslashOmega(\backslashlog n){\$} bits. Within {\$}O(r\backslashlog (n/r)){\$} space, our index can also count in optimal time {\$}O(m){\$}. Raising the space to {\$}O(r w\backslashlog{\_}\backslashsigma(n/r)){\$}, we support count and locate in {\$}O(m\backslashlog(\backslashsigma)/w){\$} and {\$}O(m\backslashlog(\backslashsigma)/w+occ){\$} time, which is optimal in the packed setting and had not been obtained before in compressed space. We also describe a structure using {\$}O(r\backslashlog(n/r)){\$} space that replaces the text and extracts any text substring of length {\$}\backslashell{\$} in almost-optimal time {\$}O(\backslashlog(n/r)+\backslashell\backslashlog(\backslashsigma)/w){\$}.

abstract = {Betweenness centrality is a fundamental measure in social network analysis, expressing the importance or influence of individual vertices (or edges) in a network in terms of the fraction of shortest paths that pass through them. Since exact computation in large networks is prohibitively expensive, we present two efficient randomized algorithms for betweenness estimation. The algorithms are based on random sampling of shortest paths and offer probabilistic guarantees on the quality of the approximation. The first algorithm estimates the betweenness of all vertices (or edges): all approximate values are within an additive factor {\$}\backslash{\$}{\{}$\backslash$backslash{\}}varepsilon {\{}$\backslash${\}}in (0,1){\$}{\$} $\epsilon$ ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) from the real values, with probability at least {\$}{\$}1-{\{}$\backslash${\}}delta {\$}{\$} 1 - $\delta$ . The second algorithm focuses on the top-K vertices (or edges) with highest betweenness and estimate their betweenness value to within a multiplicative factor {\$}\backslash{\$}{\{}$\backslash$backslash{\}}varepsilon {\$}{\$} $\epsilon$ , with probability at least {\$}{\$}1-{\{}$\backslash${\}}delta {\$}{\$} 1 - $\delta$ . This is the first algorithm that can compute such approximation for the top-K vertices (or edges). By proving upper and lower bounds to the VC-dimension of a range set associated with the problem at hand, we can bound the sample size needed to achieve the desired approximations. We obtain sample sizes that are independent from the number of vertices in the network and only depend on a characteristic quantity that we call the vertex-diameter, that is the maximum number of vertices in a shortest path. In some cases, the sample size is completely independent from any quantitative property of the graph. An extensive experimental evaluation on real and artificial networks shows that our algorithms are significantly faster and much more scalable as the number of vertices grows than other algorithms with similar approximation guarantees.},

The paper describes a dynamic programming (DP) scheme to solve the NTD-CR problem, and proposes a DP approach, called Dynamic Programming Algorithm to solve NTD-CR (DPCR-ST), to generate the topology using a selected sequence of spanning trees of the network, STXmin The paper shows that our DPCR-ST approach always provides a feasible solution, and produces an optimal topology given an optimal order of spanning trees. The paper proves that the problem of optimally ordering the spanning trees is NP-complete, and proposes three greedy heuristics to generate and order only spanning trees of the network. Each heuristic allows the DPCR-ST approach to generate STXmin using only spanning trees, which improves the time complexity while producing a near optimal topology. Simulations based on fully connected networks that contain up to 2.3 x 10(9) spanning trees show the merits of using the ordering methods and the effectiveness of our algorithm vis-a-vis to four existing state-of-the-art techniques. Our DPCR-ST approach is able to generate 81.5{\%} optimal results, while using only 0.77{\%} of the spanning trees contained in networks. Further, for a typical 2 100 grid network that contains up to 1.899(102) spanning trees, DPCR-ST approach requires only k = 1214 spanning trees to generate a topology with a reliability no larger than 5.05{\%} off from optimal.},

abstract = {Betweenness centrality ranks the importance of nodes by their participation in all shortest paths of the network. Therefore computing exact betweenness values is impractical in large networks. For static networks, approximation based on randomly sampled paths has been shown to be significantly faster in practice. However, for dynamic networks, no approximation algorithm for betweenness centrality is known that improves on static recomputation. We address this deficit by proposing two incremental approximation algorithms (for weighted and unweighted connected graphs) which provide a provable guarantee on the absolute approximation error. Processing batches of edge insertions, our algorithms yield significant speedups up to a factor of {\$}10{\^{}}4{\$} compared to restarting the approximation. This is enabled by investing memory to store and efficiently update shortest paths. As a building block, we also propose an asymptotically faster algorithm for updating the SSSP problem in unweighted graphs. Our experimental study shows that our algorithms are the first to make in-memory computation of a betweenness ranking practical for million-edge semi-dynamic networks. Moreover, our results show that the accuracy is even better than the theoretical guarantees in terms of absolutes errors and the rank of nodes is well preserved, in particular for those with high betweenness.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study the set cover problem in the fully dynamic model. In this model, the set of active elements, i.e., those that must be covered at any given time, can change due to element arrivals and departures. The goal is to maintain an algorithmic solution that is competitive with respect to the current optimal solution. This model is popular in both the dynamic algorithms and online algorithms communities. The difference is in the restriction placed on the algorithm: in dynamic algorithms, the running time of the algorithm making updates (called update time) is bounded, while in online algorithms, the number of updates made to the solution (called recourse) is limited. In this paper we show the following results: In the update time setting, we obtain O(log n)-competitiveness with O(f log n) amortized update time, and O(f{\^{}}3)-competitiveness with O(f{\^{}}2) update time. The O(log n)-competitive algorithm is the first one to achieve a competitive ratio independent of f in this setting. In the recourse setting, we show a competitive ratio of O(min{\{}log n,f{\}}) with constant amortized recourse. Note that this matches the best offline bounds with just constant recourse, something that is impossible in the classical online model. Our results are based on two algorithmic frameworks in the fully-dynamic model that are inspired by the classic greedy and primal-dual algorithms for offline set cover. We show that both frameworks can be used for obtaining both recourse and update time bounds, thereby demonstrating algorithmic techniques common to these strands of research.},

For two different attacking strategies we find that the system changes from a secondorder phase transition to a firstorder phase transition as coupling strength q increases. We also notice that the firstorder region becomes smaller and the secondorder region becomes larger as average degree or clustering coefficient increases. And, as the average supported degree approaches infinity, coupled clustered networks become independent and only the secondorder transition is observed, which is similar to q = 0. Furthermore, we find that clustering coefficient has a significant impact on robustness of the system for strong coupling strength, but for weak coupling strength it has little influence, especially for attacking both networks. The study implies that we can obtain a more robust network by reducing clustering coefficient and increasing average degree for strong coupling strength. However, for weak coupling strength, a more robust network is obtained only by increasing average degree for the same support average degree. Additionally, we find that for attacking both networks the system becomes more vulnerable and difficult to defend compared to attacking only one network.},

abstract = {Information flow in social network is assumed to be transmitted from node to node through the edges of network. In real world, however, people are influenced not only by local social neighbors but also by out-of-network services and sources, such as mass media and external websites. As a consequence, in addition to spreading by social edges, information can also reach a long-distance node by "jumping" cross the network. Then one of important issues coming out of the phenomenon is: how do these external services affect the diffusion process in social network? In this paper we develop an algorithm which allows us to distinguish the effects of external influence in diffusion process. By applying the algorithm to millions of diffusion cascades, we find that, although only a small portion of reshare activities arise from external influence directly, external influence plays a significant role in information diffusion. In particular, external influence affects nearly 50{\%} to 70{\%} of cascade node in average, and the effects become stronger as the cascade becomes larger. In addition, we characterize external influence as two categories, and show that one category mainly affects the size of diffusion tree and the other focuses on affecting the depth. Finally, we find that, due to the external services, the influentials become less important and more large cascades can be triggered by ordinary people. Together, these observations suggest new directions for modeling diffusion process and constructing more useful viral marketing strategy.},

abstract = {In this paper we study the problem of local triangle counting in large graphs. Namely, given a large graph G = (V;E) we want to estimate as accurately as possible the number of triangles incident to every node $\upsilon$ ∈ V in the graph. The problem of computing the global number of triangles in a graph has been considered before, but to our knowledge this is the first paper that addresses the problem of local triangle counting with a focus on the efficiency issues arising in massive graphs. The distribution of the local number of triangles and the related local clustering coefficient can be used in many interesting applications. For example, we show that the measures we compute can help to detect the presence of spamming activity in large-scale Web graphs, as well as to provide useful features to assess content quality in social networks. For computing the local number of triangles we propose two approximation algorithms, which are based on the idea of min-wise independent permutations (Broder et al. 1998). Our algorithms operate in a semi-streaming fashion, using O(jV j) space in main memory and performing O(log jV j) sequential scans over the edges of the graph. The first algorithm we describe in this paper also uses O(jEj) space in external memory during computation, while the second algorithm uses only main memory. We present the theoretical analysis as well as experimental results in massive graphs demonstrating the practical efficiency of our approach.},

abstract = {Competitive interactions represent one of the driving forces behind evolution and natural selection in biological and sociological systems 1,2 . For example, animals in an ecosystem may vie for food or mates; in a market economy, firms may compete over the same group of customers; sensory stimuli may compete for limited neural resources to enter the focus of attention. Here, we derive rules based on the spectral properties of the network governing the competitive interactions between groups of agents organized in networks. In the scenario studied here the winner of the competition, and the time needed to prevail, essentially depend on the way a given network connects to its competitors and on its internal structure. Our results allow assessment of the extent to which real networks optimize the outcome of their interaction, but also provide strategies through which competing networks can improve on their situation. The proposed approach is applicable to a wide range of systems that can be modelled as networks 3 . Often, the outcome of a competitive process between agents is affected not only by their direct competitors but also by the specific network of connections in which they operate. Complex networks theory offers a large number of topological measures 3 , which can be derived in a simple way from the adjacency matrix G, containing the information on network connectivity. These measures can then be used to explain important dynamical and functional properties such as robustness 4,5 , synchronization 6 , spreading 7 or congestion 8,9 . Hitherto, the emphasis has been on the properties of single isolated networks. Typically, however, networks interact with other networks, while simultaneously retaining their original identity. Recently, a few studies have examined how global structural properties or dynamical processes are affected by the existence of connected networks, showing for instance that robustness 10–13 , synchronization 14 , cooperation 15,16 , transport 17 or epidemic spreading 18–21 change markedly when considering a network of networks 22 . Interestingly, although certain types of network interdependence may enhance vulnerability with respect to the case of isolated networks 10 , the addition of links between networks may also hinder cascading processes, such as failures in a power grid, on interconnected networks 23 . This holistic view requires a broad redefinition of classical network parameters 24 . Even more importantly, one of the major challenges lies in the identification of guidelines for how to best link networks 25 . If one considers the outcome of interaction from the perspective of a single network, which is either forced into or evaluates the benefits from interacting with another one, an important challenge arises: How can I make the most of my interaction with another network? To answer this question, we consider two separate networks competing for given limited resources, which in general are related to the structural properties of the network and to the outcome of a certain dynamical process. The two networks interact by creating common links, but retain their original identity.},

We present new computational tools for simulating and analyzing RNA folding kinetic metrics such as population kinetics, folding rates, and the folding of particular subsequences. Our method first builds an approximate representation (called a map) of the RNA's folding energy landscape, and then uses specialized analysis techniques to extract folding kinetics from the map. We provide a new sampling strategy called Probabilistic Boltzmann Sampling (PBS) that enables us to approximate the folding landscape with much smaller maps, typically by several orders of magnitude. We also describe a new analysis technique, Map-based Monte Carlo (MMC) simulation, to stochastically extract folding pathways from the map. We demonstrate that our technique can be applied to large RNA (e.g., 200+ nucleotides), where representing the full landscape is infeasible, and that our tools provide results comparable to other simulation methods that work on complete energy landscapes. We present results showing that our approach computes the same relative functional rates as seen in experiments for the relative plasmid replication rates of ColE1 RNAII and its mutants, and for the relative gene expression rates of MS2 phage RNA and its mutants.},

abstract = {We introduce network L-cloning, a technique for creating ensembles of random networks from any given real-world or artificial network. Each member of the ensemble is an L-cloned network constructed from L copies of the original network. The degree distribution of an L-cloned network and, more importantly, the degree-degree correlation between and beyond nearest neighbors are identical to those of the original network. The density of triangles in an L-cloned network, and hence its clustering coefficient, is reduced by a factor of L compared to those of the original network. Furthermore, the density of loops of any fixed length approaches zero for sufficiently large values of L. Other variants of L-cloning allow us to keep intact the short loops of certain lengths. As an application, we employ these network cloning methods to investigate the effect of short loops on dynamical processes running on networks and to inspect the accuracy of corresponding tree-based theories. We demonstrate that dynamics on L-cloned networks (with sufficiently large L) are accurately described by the so-called adjacency tree-based theories, examples of which include the message passing technique, some pair approximation methods, and the belief propagation algorithm used respectively to study bond percolation, SI epidemics, and the Ising model.},

abstract = {Complex systems are very often organized under the form of networks where nodes and edges are embedded in space. Transportation and mobility networks, Internet, mobile phone networks, power grids, social and contact networks, and neural networks, are all examples where space is relevant and where topology alone does not contain all the information. Characterizing and understanding the structure and the evolution of spatial networks is thus crucial for many different fields, ranging from urbanism to epidemiology. An important consequence of space on networks is that there is a cost associated with the length of edges which in turn has dramatic effects on the topological structure of these networks. We will thoroughly explain the current state of our understanding of how the spatial constraints affect the structure and properties of these networks. We will review the most recent empirical observations and the most important models of spatial networks. We will also discuss various processes which take place on these spatial networks, such as phase transitions, random walks, synchronization, navigation, resilience, and disease spread. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Traditional online algorithms encapsulate decision making under uncertainty, and give ways to hedge against all possible future events, while guaranteeing a nearly optimal solution as compared to an offline optimum. On the other hand, machine learning algorithms are in the business of extrapolating patterns found in the data to predict the future, and usually come with strong guarantees on the expected generalization error. In this work we develop a framework for augmenting online algorithms with a machine learned oracle to achieve competitive ratios that provably improve upon unconditional worst case lower bounds when the oracle has low error. Our approach treats the oracle as a complete black box, and is not dependent on its inner workings, or the exact distribution of its errors. We apply this framework to the traditional caching problem -- creating an eviction strategy for a cache of size {\$}k{\$}. We demonstrate that naively following the oracle's recommendations may lead to very poor performance, even when the average error is quite low. Instead we show how to modify the Marker algorithm to take into account the oracle's predictions, and prove that this combined approach achieves a competitive ratio that both (i) decreases as the oracle's error decreases, and (ii) is always capped by {\$}O(\backslashlog k){\$}, which can be achieved without any oracle input. We complement our results with an empirical evaluation of our algorithm on real world datasets, and show that it performs well empirically even using simple off-the-shelf predictions.},

abstract = {The problem of deploying sensors in a large water distribution network is considered, in order to detect the malicious introduction of contaminants. It is shown that a large class of realistic objective functions-such as reduction of detection time and the population protected from consuming contaminated water-exhibits an important diminishing returns effect called submodularity. The submodularity of these objectives is exploited in order to design efficient placement algorithms with provable performance guarantees. The algorithms presented in this paper do not rely on mixed integer programming, and scale well to networks of arbitrary size. The problem instances considered in the approach presented in this paper are orders of magnitude (a factor of 72) larger than the largest problems solved in the literature. It is shown how the method presented here can be extended to multicriteria optimization, selecting placements robust to sensor failures and optimizing minimax criteria. Extensive empirical evidence on the effectiveness of the method presented in this paper on two benchmark distribution networks, and an actual drinking water distribution system of greater than 21,000 nodes, is presented.},

abstract = {In this paper we analyze an adaptive sampling approach for submodular maximization. Adap-tive sampling is a technique that has recently been shown to achieve a constant factor approximation guarantee for submodular maximization under a cardinality constraint with exponentially fewer adaptive rounds than any previously studied con-stant factor approximation algorithm for this prob-lem. Adaptivity quantifies the number of sequen-tial rounds that an algorithm makes when function evaluations can be executed in parallel and is the parallel running time of an algorithm, up to low order terms. Adaptive sampling achieves its expo-nential speedup at the expense of approximation. In theory, it is guaranteed to produce a solution that is a 1/3 approximation to the optimum. Nev-ertheless, experiments show that adaptive sam-pling techniques achieve far better values in prac-tice. In this paper we provide theoretical justifica-tion for this phenomenon. In particular, we show that under very mild conditions of curvature of a function, adaptive sampling techniques achieve an approximation arbitrarily close to 1/2 while maintaining their low adaptivity. Furthermore, we show that the approximation ratio approaches 1 in direct relationship to a homogeneity property of the submodular function. In addition, we con-duct experiments on real data sets in which the curvature and homogeneity properties can be eas-ily manipulated and demonstrate the relationship between approximation and curvature, as well as the effectiveness of adaptive sampling in practice.},

abstract = {Advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques tried to automatically categorize the emotions elicited by abstract paintings with limited success. Since the annotation of the emotional content is highly resourceconsuming, datasets of abstract paintings are either constrained in size or partially annotated. Consequently, it is natural to address the targeted task within a transductive framework. Intuitively, the use of multi-label classification techniques is desirable so to synergically exploit the relations between multiple latent variables, such as emotional content, technique, author, etc. A very popular approach for transductive multi-label recognition under linear classification settings is matrix completion. In this study we introduce non-linear matrix completion (NLMC), thus extending classical linear matrix completion techniques to the non-linear case. Together with the theory grounding the model, we propose an efficient optimization solver. As shown by our extensive experimental validation on two publicly available datasets, NLMC outperforms state-of-the-art methods when recognizing emotions from abstract paintings.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of maximizing a nonnegative (possibly non-monotone) submodular set function with or without constraints. Feige et al. [FOCS'07] showed a 2/5-approximation for the unconstrained problem and also proved that no approximation better than 1/2 is possible in the value oracle model. Constant-factor approximation was also given for submodular maximization subject to a matroid independence constraint (a factor of 0.309 Vondrak [FOCS'09]) and for submodular maximization subject to a matroid base constraint, provided that the fractional base packing number is at least 2 (a 1/4-approximation, Vondrak [FOCS'09]). In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for submodular maximization which is based on the idea of {\{}$\backslash$em simulated annealing{\}}. We prove that this algorithm achieves improved approximation for two problems: a 0.41-approximation for unconstrained submodular maximization, and a 0.325-approximation for submodular maximization subject to a matroid independence constraint. On the hardness side, we show that in the value oracle model it is impossible to achieve a 0.478-approximation for submodular maximization subject to a matroid independence constraint, or a 0.394-approximation subject to a matroid base constraint in matroids with two disjoint bases. Even for the special case of cardinality constraint, we prove it is impossible to achieve a 0.491-approximation. (Previously it was conceivable that a 1/2-approximation exists for these problems.) It is still an open question whether a 1/2-approximation is possible for unconstrained submodular maximization.},

In this paper, we study influence maximization in the linear threshold model, one of the important models formalizing the behavior of influence propagation in social networks. We first show that computing exact influence in general networks in the linear threshold model is {\#}P-hard, which closes an open problem left in the seminal work on influence maximization by Kempe, Kleinberg, and Tardos, 2003. As a contrast, we show that computing influence in directed a cyclic graphs (DAGs) can be done in time linear to the size of the graphs. Based on the fast computation in DAGs, we propose the first scalable influence maximization algorithm tailored for the linear threshold model. We conduct extensive simulations to show that our algorithm is scalable to networks with millions of nodes and edges, is orders of magnitude faster than the greedy approximation algorithm proposed by Kempe et al. and its optimized versions, and performs consistently among the best algorithms while other heuristic algorithms not design specifically for the linear threshold model have unstable performances on different real-world networks.},

The cost of the update operations depends on the class of the considered graph and on the number of the output updates, i.e., on the number of vertices that, due to an edge modification, either change the distance from the source or change the parent in the shortest paths tree. We first show that, if we deal only with updates on the weights of edges, then the update procedures require O(logn) worst case time per output update for several classes of graphs, as in the case of graphs with bounded genus, bounded arboricity, bounded degree, bounded treewidth, and bounded pagenumber. For general graphs with n vertices and m edges the algorithms require O(mlogn) worst case time per output update. We also show that, if insertions and deletions of edges are allowed, then similar amortized bounds hold.},

abstract = {In the Submodular Welfare Problem, m items are to be distributed among n players with utility functions wi: 2[m] → R+. The utility functions are assumed to be monotone and submodular. Assuming that player i receives a set of items Si, we wish to maximize the total utility $\backslash$Sigmai=1n wi(Si). In this paper, we work in the value oracle model where the only access to the utility functions is through a black box returning wi(S) for a given set S. Submodular Welfare is in fact a special case of the more general problem of submodular maximization subject to a matroid constraint: maxf(S): S ∈ I, where f is monotone submodular and I is the collection of independent sets in some matroid. For both problems, a greedy algorithm is known to yield a 1/2-approximation [21, 16]. In special cases where the matroid is uniform (I = S: $\backslash$textbarS$\backslash$textbar ≤ k) [20] or the submodular function is of a special type [4, 2], a (1-1/e)-approximation has been achieved and this is optimal for these problems in the value oracle model [22, 6, 15]. A (1-1/e)-approximation for the general Submodular Welfare Problem has been known only in a stronger demand oracle model [4], where in fact 1-1/e can be improved [9]. In this paper, we develop a randomized continuous greedy algorithm which achieves a (1-1/e)-approximation for the Submodular Welfare Problem in the value oracle model. We also show that the special case of n equal players is approximation resistant, in the sense that the optimal (1-1/e)-approximation is achieved by a uniformly random solution. Using the pipage rounding technique [1, 2], we obtain a (1-1/e)-approximation for submodular maximization subject to any matroid constraint. The continuous greedy algorithm has a potential of wider applicability, which we demonstrate on the examples of the Generalized Assignment Problem and the AdWords Assignment Problem.},

abstract = {Measures that estimate the clustering coefficients of ego and overall social networks are important to social network studies. Existing measures differ in how they define and estimate triplet clustering with implications for how network theoretic properties are reflected. In this paper, we propose a novel definition of triplet clustering for weighted and undirected social networks that explicitly considers the relative strength of the tie connecting the two alters of the ego in the triplet. We argue that our proposed definition better reflects theorized effects of the important third tie in the social network literature. We also develop new methods for estimating triplet, local and global clustering. Three different types of mathematical means, i.e. arithmetic, geometric, and quadratic, are used to reflect alternative theoretical assumptions concerning the marginal effect of tie substitution. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Many real-world complex systems consist of a set of elementary units connected by relationships of different kinds. All such systems are better described in terms of multiplex networks, where the links at each layer represent a different type of interaction between the same set of nodes, rather than in terms of (single-layer) networks. In this paper we present a general framework to describe and study multiplex networks, whose links are either unweighted or weighted. In particular we propose a series of measures to characterize the multiplexicity of the systems in terms of: i) basic node and link properties such as the node degree, and the edge overlap and reinforcement, ii) local properties such as the clustering coefficient and the transitivity, iii) global properties related to the navigability of the multiplex across the different layers. The measures we introduce are validated on a genuine multiplex data set of Indonesian terrorists, where information among 78 individuals are recorded with respect to mutual trust, common operations, exchanged communications and business relationships.},

abstract = {Identifying influential nodes in very large-scale directed networks is a big challenge relevant to disparate applications, such as accelerating information propagation, controlling rumors and diseases, designing search engines, and understanding hierarchical organization of social and biological networks. Known methods range from node centralities, such as degree, closeness and betweenness, to diffusion-based processes, like PageRank and LeaderRank. Some of these methods already take into account the influences of a node's neighbors but do not directly make use of the interactions among it's neighbors. Local clustering is known to have negative impacts on the information spreading. We further show empirically that it also plays a negative role in generating local connections. Inspired by these facts, we propose a local ranking algorithm named ClusterRank, which takes into account not only the number of neighbors and the neighbors' influences, but also the clustering coefficient. Subject to the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) spreading model with constant infectivity, experimental results on two directed networks, a social network extracted from delicious.com and a large-scale short-message communication network, demonstrate that the ClusterRank outperforms some benchmark algorithms such as PageRank and LeaderRank. Furthermore, ClusterRank can also be applied to undirected networks where the superiority of ClusterRank is significant compared with degree centrality and k-core decomposition. In addition, ClusterRank, only making use of local information, is much more efficient than global methods: It takes only 191 seconds for a network with about [Formula: see text] nodes, more than 15 times faster than PageRank.},

abstract = {We describe a mechanism for biological learning and adaptation based on two simple principles: (i) Neuronal activity propagates only through the network's strongest synaptic connections (extremal dynamics), and (ii) the strengths of active synapses are reduced if mistakes are made, otherwise no changes occur (negative feedback). The balancing of those two tendencies typically shapes a synaptic landscape with configurations which are barely stable, and therefore highly flexible. This allows for swift adaptation to new situations. Recollection of past successes is achieved by punishing synapses which have once participated in activity associated with successful outputs much less than neurons that have never been successful. Despite its simplicity, the model can readily learn to solve complicated nonlinear tasks, even in the presence of noise. In particular, the learning time for the benchmark parity problem scales algebraically with the problem size N, with an exponent k∼1.4.},

abstract = {DR-submodular continuous functions are important objectives with wide real-world applications spanning MAP inference in determinantal point processes (DPPs), and mean-field inference for probabilistic submodular models, amongst others. DR-submodularity captures a subclass of non-convex functions that enables both exact minimization and approximate maximization in polynomial time. In this work we study the problem of maximizing non-monotone DR-submodular continuous functions under general down-closed convex constraints. We start by investigating geometric properties that underlie such objectives, e.g., a strong relation between (approximately) stationary points and global optimum is proved. These properties are then used to devise two optimization algorithms with provable guarantees. Concretely, we first devise a "two-phase" algorithm with {\$}1/4{\$} approximation guarantee. This algorithm allows the use of existing methods for finding (approximately) stationary points as a subroutine, thus, harnessing recent progress in non-convex optimization. Then we present a non-monotone Frank-Wolfe variant with {\$}1/e{\$} approximation guarantee and sublinear convergence rate. Finally, we extend our approach to a broader class of generalized DR-submodular continuous functions, which captures a wider spectrum of applications. Our theoretical findings are validated on synthetic and real-world problem instances.},

The automation of epilepsy detection using signal processing techniques such as wavelet transform and entropies may optimise the performance of the system. Many algorithms have been developed to diagnose the presence of seizure in the EEG signals. The entropy is a nonlinear parameter that reflects the complexity of the EEG signal. Many entropies have been used to differentiate normal, interictal and ictal EEG signals. This paper discusses various entropies used for an automated diagnosis of epilepsy using EEG signals. We have presented unique ranges for various entropies used to differentiate normal, interictal, and ictal EEG signals and also ranked them depending on the ability to discrimination ability of three classes. These entropies can be used to classify the different stages of epilepsy and can also be used for other biomedical applications.},

Betweenness is, in some sense, a measure of the influence a node has over the spread of information through the network. By counting only shortest paths, however, the conventional definition implicitly assumes that information spreads only along those shortest paths. Here, we propose a betweenness measure that relaxes this assumption, including contributions from essentially all paths between nodes, not just the shortest, although it still gives more weight to short paths. The measure is based on random walks, counting how often a node is traversed by a random walk between two other nodes. We show how our measure can be calculated using matrix methods, and give some examples of its application to particular networks.},

abstract = {The paper studies the qualitative behavior of a set of ordinary differential equations (ODE) that models the dynamics of bi-virus epidemics over bilayer networks. Each layer is a weighted digraph associated with a strain of virus; the weights gz$\iota$́represent the rates of infection from node i to node j of strain z. We establish a sufficient condition on the g's that guarantees survival of the fittest-only one strain survives. We propose an ordering of the weighted digraphs, the *-order, and show that if the weighted digraph of strain y is *-dominated by the weighted digraph of strain x, then y dies out in the long run. We prove that the orbits of the ODE accumulate to an attractor that captures the survival of the fittest phenomenon. Due to the coupled nonlinear high-dimension nature of the ODEs, there is no natural Lyapunov function to study their global qualitative behavior. We prove our results by combining two important properties of these ODEs: (i) monotonicity under a partial ordering on the set of graphs; and (ii) dimension-reduction under symmetry of the graphs. Property (ii) allows us to fully address the survival of the fittest for regular graphs. Then, by bounding the epidemics dynamics for generic networks by the dynamics on regular networks, we prove the result for general networks.},

abstract = {We propose an external memory algorithm for the computation of the BWT and LCP array for a collection of sequences. Our algorithm takes the amount of available memory as an input parameter, and tries to make the best use of it by splitting the input collection into subcollections sufficiently small that it can compute their BWT in RAM using an optimal linear time algorithm. Next, it merges the partial BWTs in external memory and in the process it also computes the LCP values. We prove that our algorithm performs O(n AveLcp) sequential I/Os, where n is the total length of the collection, and AveLcp is the average Longest Common Prefix of the collection. This bound is an improvement over the known algorithms for the same task. The experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms the current best algorithm for collections of sequences with different lengths and for collections with relatively small average Longest Common Prefix. In the second part of the paper, we show that our algorithm can be modified to output two additional arrays that, used with the BWT and LCP arrays, provide simple, scan based, external memory algorithms for three well known problems in bioinformatics: the computation of maximal repeats, the all pairs suffix-prefix overlaps, and the construction of succinct de Bruijn graphs. To our knowledge, there are no other known external memory algorithms for these problems.},

abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance has become an imminent concern for public health. As methods for detection and characterization of antimicrobial resistance move from targeted culture and polymerase chain reaction to high throughput metagenomics, appropriate resources for the analysis of large-scale data are required. Currently, antimicrobial resistance databases are tailored to smaller-scale, functional profiling of genes using highly descriptive annotations. Such characteristics do not facilitate the analysis of large-scale, ecological sequence datasets such as those produced with the use of metagenomics for surveillance. In order to overcome these limitations, we present MEGARes (https://megares.meglab.org), a hand-curated antimicrobial resistance database and annotation structure that provides a foundation for the development of high throughput acyclical classifiers and hierarchical statistical analysis of big data. MEGARes can be browsed as a stand-alone resource through the website or can be easily integrated into sequence analysis pipelines through download. Also via the website, we provide documentation for AmrPlusPlus, a user-friendly Galaxy pipeline for the analysis of high throughput sequencing data that is pre-packaged for use with the MEGARes database.},

abstract = {Brands and agencies use marketing as a tool to influence customers. One of the major decisions in a marketing plan deals with the allocation of a given budget among media channels in order to maximize the impact on a set of potential customers. A similar situation occurs in a social network, where a marketing budget needs to be distributed among a set of potential influencers in a way that provides high-impact. We introduce several probabilistic models to capture the above scenarios. The common setting of these models consists of a bipartite graph of source and target nodes. The objective is to allocate a fixed budget among the source nodes to maximize the expected number of influenced target nodes. The concrete way in which source nodes influence target nodes depends on the underlying model. We primarily consider two models: a source-side influence model, in which a source node that is allocated a budget of k makes k independent trials to influence each of its neighboring target nodes, and a target-side influence model, in which a target node becomes influenced according to a specified rule that depends on the overall budget allocated to its neighbors. Our main results are an optimal (1 - 1/e)-approximation algorithm for the source-side model, and several inapproximability results for the target-side model, establishing that influence maximization in the latter model is provably harder.},

A subset of E that intersects every triangle of G is called a triangle cover of (G, w), and its weight is the total weight of its edges. A collection of triangles in G (repetition allowed) is called a triangle packing of (G, w) if each edge e ∈ E appears in at most w(e) members of the collection. Let $\tau$ t (G, w) and $\nu$ t (G, w) denote the minimum weight of a triangle cover and the maximum cardinality of a triangle packing of (G, w), respectively.

In this paper, using a hypergraph approach, we design polynomial-time combinatorial algorithms for finding triangle covers of small weights. These algorithms imply new sufficient conditions for the conjecture of Chapuy et al. More precisely, given (G, w), suppose that all edges of G are covered by the set (Formula presented.) consisting of edge sets of triangles in G.

Betweenness is, in some sense, a measure of the influence a node has over the spread of information through the network. By counting only shortest paths, however, the conventional definition implicitly assumes that information spreads only along those shortest paths. Here, we propose a betweenness measure that relaxes this assumption, including contributions from essentially all paths between nodes, not just the shortest, although it still gives more weight to short paths. The measure is based on random walks, counting how often a node is traversed by a random walk between two other nodes. We show how our measure can be calculated using matrix methods, and give some examples of its application to particular networks. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

While efficient streaming methods have been recently developed for monotone submodular maximization, in a wide range of applications, such as video summarization, the underlying utility function is non-monotone, and there are often various constraints imposed on the optimization problem to consider privacy or personalization.

abstract = {In this paper, we propose the amphibious influence maximization (AIM) model that combines traditional marketing via content providers and viral marketing to consumers in social networks in a single framework. In AIM, a set of content providers and consumers form a bipartite network while consumers also form their social network, and influence propagates from the content providers to consumers and among consumers in the social network following the independent cascade model. An advertiser needs to select a subset of seed content providers and a subset of seed consumers, such that the influence from the seed providers passing through the seed consumers could reach a large number of consumers in the social network in expectation. We prove that the AIM problem is NP-hard to approximate to within any constant factor via a reduction from Feige's k-prover proof system for 3-SAT5. We also give evidence that even when the social network graph is trivial (i.e. has no edges), a polynomial time constant factor approximation for AIM is unlikely. However, when we assume that the weighted bi-adjacency matrix that describes the influence of content providers on consumers is of constant rank, a common assumption often used in recommender systems, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm that achieves approximation ratio of {\$}(1-1/e-\backslashepsilon){\^{}}3{\$} for any (polynomially small) {\$}\backslashepsilon {\textgreater} 0{\$}.

These features also make the smart grid a target for a number of cyber attacks. In this paper, we study the problem of price modification attack (PMA) through fabrication of price messages, which induces changes in load profiles of individual users and eventually causes major alteration in the load profile of the entire network. Combining with cascading failure, it ends up with a highly damaging attack. We prove that the problem is nondeterministic polynomial-time-complete and provide its inapproximability. We devise two approaches for the problem, the former deals with maximizing failure of lines with the given resource and then extending the effect with cascading failure, while the later takes cascading potential into account while choosing the lines to fail. We formulate new protection strategy against PMA and this includes two new algorithms, namely bi-level programming with new branching method and an effective heuristic to improve the running time. Empirical results on both IEEE bus data and real network help us evaluate our approaches under various settings of grid parameters.},

abstract = {With a rapid expansion of online social networks (OSNs), millions of users are tweeting and sharing their personal status daily without being aware of where that information eventually travels to. Likewise, with a huge magnitude of data available on OSNs, it poses a substantial challenge to track how a piece of information leaks to specific targets. In this paper, we study the problem of smartly sharing information to control the propagation of sensitive information in OSNs. In particular, we formulate and investigate the Maximum Circle of Trust problem of which we seek to construct a circle of trust on the fly so that OSN users can safely share their information knowing that it will not be propagated to their unwanted targets (whom they are not willing to share with). Since most of messages in OSNs are propagated within 2 to 5 hops, we first investigate this problem under 2-hop information propagation by showing the hardness of obtaining an optimal solution, along with an algorithm with proven performance guarantee. In a general case where information can be propagated more than two hops, the problem is {\#}P-hard i.e. the problem cannot be solved in a polynomial time. Thus we propose a novel greedy algorithm, hybridizing the handy but costly sampling method with a novel cut-based estimation. The quality of the hybrid algorithm is comparable to that of the sampling method while taking only a tiny fraction of the time. We have validated the effectiveness of our solutions in many real-world traces. Such an extensive experiment also highlights several important observations on information leakage which help to sharpen the security of OSNs in the future.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Copyright 2016, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved. In multi-label learning, there are two main challenges: missing labels and class imbalance (CIB). The former assumes that only a partial set of labels are provided for each training instance while other labels are missing. CIB is observed from two perspectives: first, the number of negative labels of each instance is much larger than its positive labels; second, the rate of positive instances (i.e. the number of positive instances divided by the total number of instances) of different classes are significantly different. Both missing labels and CIB lead to significant performance degradation. In this work, we propose a new method to handle these two challenges simultaneously. We formulate the problem as a constrained submodular minimization that is composed of a submodular objective function that encourages label consistency and smoothness, as well as, class cardinality bound constraints to handle class imbalance. We further present a convex approximation based on the Lovasz extension of submodular functions, leading to a linear program, which can be efficiently solved by the alternative direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the improved performance of our method over several state-of-the-art methods.},

Using these measures, motif scores and clustering coefficient can be generalized to weighted networks. To demonstrate these concepts, we apply them to financial and metabolic networks and find that inclusion of weights may considerably modify the conclusions obtained from the study of unweighted characteristics.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

In particular, for these datasets, we construct and investigate the retweet graphs. We find that the retweet graph for a trending topic has a relatively dense largest connected component (LCC). Next, based on the insights obtained from the analyses of the datasets, we design a mathematical model that describes the evolution of a retweet graph by three main parameters. We then quantify, analytically and by simulation, the influence of the model parameters on the basic characteristics of the retweet graph, such as the density of edges and the size and density of the LCC. Finally, we put the model in practice, estimate its parameters and compare the resulting behavior of the model to our datasets.},

In addition, the decision-making process sometimes has to be made under uncertainty where certain inputs are not known exactly. In this paper, we develop three stochastic multi-objective models for designing transportation network under demand uncertainty. These three stochastic multi-objective NDP models are formulated as the expected value multi-objective programming (EVMOP) model, chance constrained multi-objective programming (CCMOP) model, and dependent chance multi-objective programming (DCMOP) model in a bi-level programming framework using different criteria to hedge against demand uncertainty. To solve these stochastic multi-objective NDP models, we develop a solution approach that explicitly optimizes all objectives under demand uncertainty by simultaneously generating a family of optimal solutions known as the Pareto optimal solution set. Numerical examples are also presented to illustrate the concept of the three stochastic multi-objective NDP models as well as the effectiveness of the solution approach.},

abstract = {Recent advances in the study of networked systems have highlighted that our interconnected world is composed of networks that are coupled to each other through different "layers" that each represent one of many possible subsystems or types of interactions. Nevertheless, it is traditional to aggregate multilayer networks into a single weighted network in order to take advantage of existing tools. This is admittedly convenient, but it is also extremely problematic, as important information can be lost as a result. It is therefore important to develop multilayer generalizations of network concepts. In this paper, we analyze triadic relations and generalize the idea of transitivity to multiplex networks. By focusing on triadic relations, which yield the simplest type of transitivity, we generalize the concept and computation of clustering coefficients to multiplex networks. We show how the layered structure of such networks introduces a new degree of freedom that has a fundamental effect on transitivity. We compute multiplex clustering coefficients for several real multiplex networks and illustrate why one must take great care when generalizing standard network concepts to multiplex networks. We also derive analytical expressions for our clustering coefficients for ensemble averages of networks in a family of random multiplex networks. Our analysis illustrates that social networks have a strong tendency to promote redundancy by closing triads at every layer and that they thereby have a different type of multiplex transitivity from transportation networks, which do not exhibit such a tendency. These insights are invisible if one only studies aggregated networks.},

abstract = {In this paper, we showcase the interplay between discrete and continuous optimization in network-structured settings. We propose the first fully decentralized optimization method for a wide class of non-convex objective functions that possess a diminishing returns property. More specifically, given an arbitrary connected network and a global continuous submodular function, formed by a sum of local functions, we develop Decentralized Continuous Greedy (DCG), a message passing algorithm that converges to the tight (1-1/e) approximation factor of the optimum global solution using only local computation and communication. We also provide strong convergence bounds as a function of network size and spectral characteristics of the underlying topology. Interestingly, DCG readily provides a simple recipe for decentralized discrete submodular maximization through the means of continuous relaxations. Formally, we demonstrate that by lifting the local discrete functions to continuous domains and using DCG as an interface we can develop a consensus algorithm that also achieves the tight (1-1/e) approximation guarantee of the global discrete solution once a proper rounding scheme is applied.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prevalence of obesity has increased substantially over the past 30 years. We performed a quantitative analysis of the nature and extent of the person-to-person spread of obesity as a possible factor contributing to the obesity epidemic. METHODS: We evaluated a densely interconnected social network of 12,067 people assessed repeatedly from 1971 to 2003 as part of the Framingham Heart Study. The body-mass index was available for all subjects. We used longitudinal statistical models to examine whether weight gain in one person was associated with weight gain in his or her friends, siblings, spouse, and neighbors. RESULTS: Discernible clusters of obese persons (body-mass index [the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters], {\textgreater} or =30) were present in the network at all time points, and the clusters extended to three degrees of separation. These clusters did not appear to be solely attributable to the selective formation of social ties among obese persons. A person's chances of becoming obese increased by 57{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 6 to 123) if he or she had a friend who became obese in a given interval. Among pairs of adult siblings, if one sibling became obese, the chance that the other would become obese increased by 40{\%} (95{\%} CI, 21 to 60). If one spouse became obese, the likelihood that the other spouse would become obese increased by 37{\%} (95{\%} CI, 7 to 73). These effects were not seen among neighbors in the immediate geographic location. Persons of the same sex had relatively greater influence on each other than those of the opposite sex. The spread of smoking cessation did not account for the spread of obesity in the network. CONCLUSIONS: Network phenomena appear to be relevant to the biologic and behavioral trait of obesity, and obesity appears to spread through social ties. These findings have implications for clinical and public health interventions.},

abstract = {Developments in the wind power industry have enabled a new generation of wind turbines with longer blades, taller towers, higher efficiency, and lower maintenance costs due to the maturity of related technologies. Nevertheless, wind turbines are still blind machines because the control center is responsible for managing and controlling individual wind turbines that are turned on or off according to demand for electricity. In this paper, we propose a communication network architecture for smart-wind power farms (Smart-WPFs). The proposed architecture is designed for wind turbines to communicate directly and share sensing data in order to maximize power generation, WPF availability, and turbine efficiency. We also designed a sensor data frame structure to carry sensing data from different wind turbine parts such as the rotor, transformer, nacelle, etc. The data frame includes a logical node ID (LNID), sensor node ID (SNID), sensor type (ST), and sensor data based on the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 61400-25 standard. We present an analytical model that describes upstream traffic between the wind turbines and the control center. Using a queueing theory approach, the upstream traffic is evaluated in view of bandwidth utilization and average queuing delay. The performance of the proposed network architectures are evaluated by using analytical and simulation models.},

abstract = {This paper initiates the studies of parallel algorithms for core maintenance in dynamic graphs. The core number is a fundamental index reflecting the cohesiveness of a graph, which are widely used in large-scale graph analytics. The core maintenance problem requires to update the core numbers of vertices after a set of edges and vertices are inserted into or deleted from the graph. We investigate the parallelism in the core update process when multiple edges and vertices are inserted or deleted. Specifically, we discover a structure called superior edge set, the insertion or deletion of edges in which can be processed in parallel. Based on the structure of superior edge set, efficient parallel algorithms are then devised for incremental and decremental core maintenance respectively. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed algorithms are the first parallel ones for the fundamental core maintenance problem. The algorithms show a significant speedup in the processing time compared with previous results that sequentially handle edge and vertex insertions/deletions. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on different types of real-world and synthetic datasets, and the results illustrate the efficiency, stability and scalability of the proposed algorithms.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE. Smart Grid addresses the problem of existing power grid's increasing complexity, growing demand and requirement for greater reliability, through two-way communication and automated residential load control among others. These features also makes the Smart Grid a target for a number of cyber attacks. In the paper, we study the problem of rate alteration attack (RAA) through fabrication of price messages which induces changes in load profiles of individual users and eventually causes major alteration in the load profile of the entire network. Combining with cascading failure, it ends up with a highly damaging attack. We prove that the problem is NP-Complete and provide its inapproximability. We devise two approaches for the problem, former deals with maximizing failure of lines with the given resource and then extending the effect with cascading failure while the later takes cascading potential into account while choosing the lines to fail. To get more insight into the impact of RAA, we also extend our algorithms to maximize number of node failures. Empirical results on both IEEE Bus data and real network help us evaluate our approaches under various settings of grid parameters.},

Our scheme results in an increased alphabet size, and by using a wavelet tree encoding of the BWT we reduce the performance impact on rank operations. We give a specialised form of the backward search that allows variation-aware exact matching. We implement this, and demonstrate the cost of constructing an index of the whole human genome with 8 million genetic variants is 25 GB of RAM.

The problem has been extensively studied but most works focus on the submodular influence diffusion models. In this paper, motivated by empirical evidences, we explore influence maximization in the non-submodular regime. In particular, we study the general threshold model in which a fraction of nodes have non-submodular threshold functions, but their threshold functions are closely upper-and lower-bounded by some submodular functions (we call them $\epsilon$-almost submodular). We first show a strong hardness result: there is no 1/n $\gamma$/c approximation for influence maximization (unless P = NP) for all networks with up to n $\gamma$ $\epsilon$-almost submodular nodes, where $\gamma$ is in (0,1) and c is a parameter depending on $\epsilon$. This indicates that influence maximization is still hard to approximate even though threshold functions are close to submodular. We then provide (1 − $\epsilon$) (1 − 1/e) approximation algorithms when the number of $\epsilon$-almost submodular nodes is . Finally, we conduct experiments on a number of real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate that our approximation algorithms outperform other baseline algorithms.},

abstract = {The high variability of solar power due to intrinsic diurnal variability, as well as additional stochastic variations due to cloud cover, have made it difficult for solar farms to participate in electricity markets that require pre-committed constant power generation. We study the use of battery storage to 'firm' solar power, that is, to remove variability so that such a pre-commitment can be made. Due to the high cost of storage, it is necessary to size the battery parsimoniously, choosing the minimum size to meet a certain reliability guarantee. Inspired by recent work that identifies an isomorphism between batteries and network buffers, we introduce a new model for solar power generation that models it as a stochastic traffic source. This permits us to use techniques from the stochastic network calculus to both size storage and to maximize the revenue that a solar farm owner can make from the day-ahead power market. Using a 10-year of recorded solar irradiance, we show that our approach attains 93{\%} of the maximum revenue in a summer day that would have been achieved in daily market had the entire solar irradiance trace been known ahead of time.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Research suggests that the growing prevalence of obesity may be related to the influence of the health behaviours of peers. We look at clustering of exercise and eating health behaviours amongst a previously unstudied group, young adults in Sweden. Previous research has mainly been conducted in the United States and Britain, countries that have relatively high rates of obesity. METHODS: Using ego-alter dyads from the egocentric network data as the unit of analysis, we conduct logistic regressions to investigate the association between ego and alter exercise and eating behaviours. RESULTS: Respondents have a significantly greater probability of engaging in regular exercise and eating healthily if a nominated peer also does so. Furthermore, the degree to which this behavior is shared is modulated by the strength of the relationship between the two individuals, with a greater probability of engaging in these behaviours observed when the relationship with the nominated peer is strong relative to when the relationship is weak. However, we find that ego-alter homogeneity in terms of gender and migration status was not associated with a significantly greater probability of behaving in a similar manner to a nominated peer. Furthermore, the status of the nominated peer as a relative or not did not impact the probability that the ego would engage in similar health behaviours to that alter. CONCLUSIONS: We observe strong associations between ego and alter health behaviours for young adults, consistent with previous research. Although we cannot draw causal inferences, these results suggest that the health behaviours of an individual's peers may play a role in shaping their own health behaviours.},

abstract = {Motivation: Building the histogram of occurrences of every {\$}k{\$}-symbol long substring of nucleotide data is a standard step in many bioinformatics applications, known under the name of {\$}k{\$}-mer counting. Its applications include developing de Bruijn graph genome assemblers, fast multiple sequence alignment and repeat detection. The tremendous amounts of NGS data require fast algorithms for {\$}k{\$}-mer counting, preferably using moderate amounts of memory. Results: We present a novel method for {\$}k{\$}-mer counting, on large datasets at least twice faster than the strongest competitors (Jellyfish{\~{}}2, KMC{\~{}}1), using about 12$\backslash$,GB (or less) of RAM memory. Our disk-based method bears some resemblance to MSPKmerCounter, yet replacing the original minimizers with signatures (a carefully selected subset of all minimizers) and using {\$}(k, x){\$}-mers allows to significantly reduce the I/O, and a highly parallel overall architecture allows to achieve unprecedented processing speeds. For example, KMC{\~{}}2 allows to count the 28-mers of a human reads collection with 44-fold coverage (106$\backslash$,GB of compressed size) in about 20 minutes, on a 6-core Intel i7 PC with an SSD.

abstract = {A well-known fact in the field of lossless text compression is that high-order entropy is a weak model when the input contains long repetitions. Motivated by this fact, decades of research have generated myriads of so-called dictionary compressors: algorithms able to reduce the text's size by exploiting its repetitiveness. Lempel-Ziv 77 is probably one of the most successful and known tools of this kind, followed by straight-line programs, run-length Burrows-Wheeler transform, and other less-known schemes. In this paper, we show that these techniques are different solutions to the same, elegant, combinatorial problem: to find a small set of positions capturing all distinct text's substrings. We call such a set a string attractor. We first show reductions between dictionary compressors and string attractors. This gives us the approximation ratios of dictionary compressors with respect to the smallest string attractor and allows us to solve several open problems related to the asymptotic relations between the output sizes of different dictionary compressors. We then show that the k-attractor problem - that is, deciding whether a text has a size-t set of positions capturing all substrings of length at most k - is NP-complete for k {\textgreater}= 3. We provide approximation techniques for the smallest k-attractor, show that the problem is APX-complete for constant k, and give strong inapproximability results. To conclude, we provide matching lower- and upper- bounds for the random access problem on string attractors. Our optimal data structure is universal: by our reductions to string attractors, it supports random access on any dictionary-compression scheme. In particular, our solution matches the lower bound also on LZ77, straight-line programs, collage systems, and macro schemes, and therefore essentially closes (at once) the random access problem for all these compressors.},

abstract = {Emerging single-molecule sequencing technologies from Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore have revived interest in long read mapping algorithms. Alignment-based seed-and-extend methods demonstrate good accuracy, but face limited scalability, while faster alignment-free methods typically trade decreased precision for efficiency. In this paper, we combine a fast approximate read mapping algorithm based on minimizers with a novel MinHash identity estimation technique to achieve both scalability and precision. In contrast to prior methods, we develop a mathematical framework that defines the types of mapping targets we uncover, establish probabilistic estimates of p-value and sensitivity , and demonstrate tolerance for alignment error rates up to 20{\%}. With this framework, our algorithm automatically adapts to different minimum length and identity requirements and provides both positional and identity estimates for each mapping reported. For mapping human PacBio reads to the hg38 reference, our method is 290x faster than BWA-MEM with a lower memory footprint and recall rate of 96{\%}. We further demonstrate the scalability of our method by mapping noisy PacBio reads (each ≥ 5 kbp in length) to the complete NCBI RefSeq database containing 838 Gbp of sequence and {\textgreater} 60, 000 genomes.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE. Device-to-device (D2D) communications has recently emerged as a promising technology for boosting the capacity of cellular systems. D2D enables direct communication between mobile devices over the cellular band without utilizing infrastructure nodes such as base stations, thereby reducing the load on cellular base stations and increasing network throughput through spatial reuse of radio resources. Hence it is important to optimally allocate these radio resources. Furthermore, since the composition of a cellular macro cell is highly dynamic, it is critical to adaptively update the resource allocation for D2D communications rather than recomputing it from scratch. In this work, we develop the first online algorithm, namely ODSRA, for dynamic resource allocation while maximizing spatial reuse. At the core of the resource allocation problem is the online set multicover problem, for which we present the first deterministic O (log n log m)-competitive online algorithm, where n is the number of elements, and m the number of sets. By simulation, we show the efficacy of ODSRA by analyzing network throughput and other metrics, obtaining a large improvement in running time over offline methods.},

As an example, the access to, and distribution of, sensor data is a major tenet of network-centric warfare and yet radio frequency (RF) links will struggle to provide the needed capacity. Free-space optical communications (FSOC) has the potential to meet these emerging military needs by offering dramatic increases in capacity. However, there are many technical challenges al multiple layers of the communications protocol stack. This article describes these challenges and discusses some mitigation approaches to provide a path to realizing this capability on the battlefield},

In contrast to the existing social contagion models, the strength of links between agents changes gradually rather than abruptly based on a threshold mechanism. An essential feature of the model - the ability to form clusters - is extensively investigated in the paper analytically and by simulation. Specifically, the distribution of clusters in random and scale-free networks is investigated, the dynamics of links within and between clusters are determined, the minimal distance between two clusters is identified. Moreover, model abstraction methods are proposed by using which aggregated opinion states of clusters of agents can be approximated with a high accuracy. These techniques also improve the computational efficiency of social contagion models (up to 6 times). ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In this paper we consider the problem of minimizing a submodular function from training data. Submodular functions can be efficiently minimized and are conse-quently heavily applied in machine learning. There are many cases, however, in which we do not know the function we aim to optimize, but rather have access to training data that is used to learn it. In this paper we consider the question of whether submodular functions can be minimized when given access to its training data. We show that even learnable submodular functions cannot be minimized within any non-trivial approximation when given access to polynomially-many sam-ples. Specifically, we show that there is a class of submodular functions with range in [0, 1] such that, despite being PAC-learnable and minimizable in polynomial-time, no algorithm can obtain an approximation strictly better than 1/2 o(1) using polynomially-many samples drawn from any distribution. Furthermore, we show that this bound is tight via a trivial algorithm that obtains an approximation of 1/2.},

abstract = {—For the purpose of propagating information and ideas through a social network, a seeding strategy aims to find a small set of seed users that are able to maximize the spread of the influence, which is termed as influence maximization problem. Despite a large number of works have studied this problem, the existing seeding strategies are limited to the static social networks. In fact, due to the high speed data transmission and the large population of participants, the diffusion processes in real-world social networks have many aspects of uncertainness. Unfortunately, as shown in the experiments, in such cases the state-of-art seeding strategies are pessimistic as they fails to trace the dynamic changes in a social network. In this paper, we study the strategies selecting seed users in an adaptive manner. We first formally model the Dynamic Independent Cascade model and introduce the concept of adaptive seeding strategy. Then based on the proposed model, we show that a simple greedy adaptive seeding strategy finds an effective solution with a provable performance guarantee. Besides the greedy algorithm an efficient heuristic algorithm is provided in order to meet practical requirements. Extensive experiments have been performed on both the real-world networks and synthetic power-law networks. The results herein demonstrate the superiority of the adaptive seeding strategies to other standard methods.

An overview of basic concepts of information consensus in networks and methods of convergence and performance analysis for the algorithms are provided. Our analysis framework is based on tools from matrix theory, algebraic graph theory, and control theory. We discuss the connections between consensus problems in networked dynamic systems and diverse applications including synchronization of coupled oscillators, flocking, formation control, fast consensus in small-world networks, Markov processes and gossip-based algorithms, load balancing in networks, rendezvous in space, distributed sensor fusion in sensor networks, and belief propagation. We establish direct connections between spectral and structural properties of complex networks and the speed of information diffusion of consensus algorithms. A brief introduction is provided on networked systems with nonlocal information flow that are considerably faster than distributed systems with lattice-type nearest neighbor interactions. Simulation results are presented that demonstrate the role of small-world effects on the speed of consensus algorithms and cooperative control of multivehicle formations},

@article{Hernandez2017,
abstract = {Many proteins work together with others in groups called complexes in order to achieve a specific function. Discovering protein complexes is important for understanding biological processes and predict protein functions in living organisms. Large-scale and throughput techniques have made possible to compile protein-protein interaction networks (PPI networks), which have been used in several computational approaches for detecting protein complexes. Those predictions might guide future biologic experimental research. Some approaches are topology-based, where highly connected proteins are predicted to be complexes; some propose different clustering algorithms using partitioning, overlaps among clusters for networks modeled with unweighted or weighted graphs; and others use density of clusters and information based on protein functionality. However, some schemes still require much processing time or the quality of their results can be improved. Furthermore, most of the results obtained with computational tools are not accompanied by an analysis of false positives. We propose an effective and efficient mining algorithm for discovering highly connected subgraphs, which is our base for defining protein complexes. Our representation is based on transforming the PPI network into a directed acyclic graph that reduces the number of represented edges and the search space for discovering subgraphs. Our approach considers weighted and unweighted PPI networks. We compare our best alternative using PPI networks from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) and Homo sapiens (human) with state-of-the-art approaches in terms of clustering, biological metrics and execution times, as well as three gold standards for yeast and two for human. Furthermore, we analyze false positive predicted complexes searching the PDBe (Protein Data Bank in Europe) database in order to identify matching protein complexes that have been purified and structurally characterized. Our analysis shows that more than 50 yeast protein complexes and more than 300 human protein complexes found to be false positives according to our prediction method, i.e., not described in the gold standard complex databases, in fact contain protein complexes that have been characterized structurally and documented in PDBe. We also found that some of these protein complexes have recently been classified as part of a Periodic Table of Protein Complexes. The latest version of our software is publicly available at http://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5297314.v1.},

abstract = {Time plays an essential role in the diffusion of information, influence and disease over networks. In many cases we only observe when a node copies information, makes a decision or becomes infected -- but the connectivity, transmission rates between nodes and transmission sources are unknown. Inferring the underlying dynamics is of outstanding interest since it enables forecasting, influencing and retarding infections, broadly construed. To this end, we model diffusion processes as discrete networks of continuous temporal processes occurring at different rates. Given cascade data -- observed infection times of nodes -- we infer the edges of the global diffusion network and estimate the transmission rates of each edge that best explain the observed data. The optimization problem is convex. The model naturally (without heuristics) imposes sparse solutions and requires no parameter tuning. The problem decouples into a collection of independent smaller problems, thus scaling easily to networks on the order of hundreds of thousands of nodes. Experiments on real and synthetic data show that our algorithm both recovers the edges of diffusion networks and accurately estimates their transmission rates from cascade data.},

abstract = {Vulnerability to sudden service disruptions due to deliberate sabotage and terrorist attacks is one of the major threats of today. In this paper, we present a bilevel formulation of the r-interdiction median problem with fortification (RIMF). RIMF identifies the most cost-effective way of allocating protective resources among the facilities of an existing but vulnerable system so that the impact of the most disruptive attack to r unprotected facilities is minimized. The model is based upon the classical p-median location model and assumes that the efficiency of the system is measured in terms of accessibility or service provision costs. In the bilevel formulation, the top level problem involves the decisions about which facilities to fortify in order to minimize the worst-case efficiency reduction due to the loss of unprotected facilities. Worst-case scenario losses are modeled in the lower-level interdiction problem. We solve the bilevel problem through an implicit enumeration (IE) algorithm, which relies on the efficient solution of the lower-level interdiction problem. Extensive computational results are reported, including comparisons with earlier results obtained by a single-level approach to the problem. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In this exploratory research paper, we start from this premise and posit that all existing index structures can be replaced with other types of models, including deep-learning models, which we term learned indexes. The key idea is that a model can learn the sort order or structure of lookup keys and use this signal to effectively predict the position or existence of records. We theoretically analyze under which conditions learned indexes outperform traditional index structures and describe the main challenges in designing learned index structures. Our initial results show, that by using neural nets we are able to outperform cache-optimized B-Trees by up to 70{\%} in speed while saving an order-of-magnitude in memory over several real-world data sets. More importantly though, we believe that the idea of replacing core components of a data management system through learned models has far reaching implications for future systems designs and that this work just provides a glimpse of what might be possible.},

@article{Gottschalk2015,
abstract = {The problem of maximizing non-negative submodular functions has been studied extensively in the last few years. However, most papers consider submodular set functions. Recently, several advances have been made for the more general case of submodular functions on the integer lattice. In this paper, we present a deterministic {\$}\backslashfrac{\{}1{\}}{\{}3{\}}{\$}-approximation for maximizing a submodular function on a bounded integer lattice {\$}\backslash{\{}0, \backslashldots, C\backslash{\}}{\^{}}n{\$} using a Double Greedy framework. Moreover, we show that the analysis is tight and that other ideas used for approximating set functions cannot easily be extended. In contrast to set functions, submodularity on the integer lattice does not imply the so-called diminishing returns property. Assuming this property, it was shown that many results for set functions can also be obtained for the integer lattice. In this paper, we consider a further generalization. Instead of the integer lattice, we consider a distributive lattice as the function domain and assume the diminishing returns (DR) property. On the one hand, we show that some approximation algorithms match the set functions setting. In particular, we can obtain a {\$}\backslashfrac{\{}1{\}}{\{}2{\}}{\$}-approximation for unconstrained maximization, a {\$}(1-\backslashfrac{\{}1{\}}{\{}e{\}}){\$}-approximation for monotone functions under a cardinality constraint and a {\$}\backslashfrac{\{}1{\}}{\{}2{\}}{\$}-approximation for a poset matroid constraint. On the other hand, for a knapsack constraint, the problem becomes significantly harder: even for monotone DR-submodular functions, we show that there is no {\$}2{\^{}}{\{}(\backslashlog (n{\^{}}{\{}1/2{\}} - 1)){\^{}}\backslashdelta - 1{\}}{\$}-approximation for every {\$}\backslashdelta {\textgreater} 0{\$} under the assumption that {\$}3-SAT{\$} cannot be solved in time {\$}2{\^{}}{\{}n{\^{}}{\{}3/4 + \backslashepsilon{\}}{\}}{\$}.},

abstract = {This paper studies the problem of detecting the information source in a network in which the spread of information follows the popular Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model. We assume all nodes in the network are in the susceptible state initially except the information source which is in the infected state. Susceptible nodes may then be infected by infected nodes, and infected nodes may recover and will not be infected again after recovery. Given a snapshot of the network, from which we know all infected nodes but cannot distinguish susceptible nodes and recovered nodes, the problem is to find the information source based on the snapshot and the network topology. We develop a sample path based approach where the estimator of the information source is chosen to be the root node associated with the sample path that most likely leads to the observed snapshot. We prove for infinite-trees, the estimator is a node that minimizes the maximum distance to the infected nodes. A reverse-infection algorithm is proposed to find such an estimator in general graphs. We prove that for {\$}g{\$}-regular trees such that {\$}gq{\textgreater}1,{\$} where {\$}g{\$} is the node degree and {\$}q{\$} is the infection probability, the estimator is within a constant distance from the actual source with a high probability, independent of the number of infected nodes and the time the snapshot is taken. Our simulation results show that for tree networks, the estimator produced by the reverse-infection algorithm is closer to the actual source than the one identified by the closeness centrality heuristic. We then further evaluate the performance of the reverse infection algorithm on several real world networks.},

abstract = {Distances in a network capture relations between nodes and are the basis of centrality, similarity, and influence measures. Often, however, the relevance of a node {\$}u{\$} to a node {\$}v{\$} is more precisely measured not by the magnitude of the distance, but by the number of nodes that are closer to {\$}v{\$} than {\$}u{\$}. That is, by the {\{}$\backslash$em rank{\}} of {\$}u{\$} in an ordering of nodes by increasing distance from {\$}v{\$}. Accordingly, rank-based measures provide a semantically different alternative to distance-based measures. In contrast to single-source distances (and "forward" ranks), which can be computed in near-linear time by Dijkstra's algorithm, we show that {\{}$\backslash$em exact{\}} reverse ranks for a single source are, in the worst-case, as hard to compute as all-pairs shortest paths, and thus can not be scalably computed even on a medium size graph. Our main contribution is the first scalable algorithm to compute {\{}$\backslash$em approximate{\}} reverse ranks within a small relative error. Our design uses near-linear processing of the graph, after which we can perform "Dijkstra-like" single-source computations that return nodes in order of increasing approximate reverse rank. Another contribution we make that is of independent interest is a novel algorithm for computing all-distances sketches, which we use for preprocessing, on multi-core architectures. We conduct an experimental evaluation on graphs with hundreds of millions of edges, demonstrating both scalability and accuracy. Finally, we define reverse-rank influence, which naturally extends reverse nearest neighbors influence [Korn and Muthukrishnan 2000] and show how our reverse-rank single-source computation facilitates scalable greedy reverse-rank influence maximization.},

abstract = {Theory of mind (ToM; Premack {\&} Woodruff, 1978) broadly refers to humans' ability to represent the mental states of others, including their desires, beliefs, and intentions. We propose to train a machine to build such models too. We design a Theory of Mind neural network -- a ToMnet -- which uses meta-learning to build models of the agents it encounters, from observations of their behaviour alone. Through this process, it acquires a strong prior model for agents' behaviour, as well as the ability to bootstrap to richer predictions about agents' characteristics and mental states using only a small number of behavioural observations. We apply the ToMnet to agents behaving in simple gridworld environments, showing that it learns to model random, algorithmic, and deep reinforcement learning agents from varied populations, and that it passes classic ToM tasks such as the "Sally-Anne" test (Wimmer {\&} Perner, 1983; Baron-Cohen et al., 1985) of recognising that others can hold false beliefs about the world. We argue that this system -- which autonomously learns how to model other agents in its world -- is an important step forward for developing multi-agent AI systems, for building intermediating technology for machine-human interaction, and for advancing the progress on interpretable AI.},

abstract = {Continuous-time Markov process models of contagions are widely studied, not least because of their utility in predicting the evolution of real-world contagions and in formulating control measures. It is often the case, however, that discrete-time approaches are employed to analyze such models or to simulate them numerically. In such cases, time is discretized into uniform steps and transition rates between states are replaced by transition probabilities. In this paper, we illustrate potential limitations to this approach. We show how discretizing time leads to a restriction on the values of the model parameters that can accurately be studied. We examine numerical simulation schemes employed in the literature, showing how synchronous-type updating schemes can bias discrete-time formalisms when compared against continuous-time formalisms. Event-based simulations, such as the Gillespie algorithm, are proposed as optimal simulation schemes both in terms of replicating the continuous-time process and computational speed. Finally, we show how discretizing time can affect the value of the epidemic threshold for large values of the infection rate and the recovery rate, even if the ratio between the former and the latter is small.},

abstract = {Providing quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees in packet networks gives rise to several challenging issues. One of them is how to determine a feasible path that satisfies a set of constraints while maintaining high utilization of network resources. The latter objective implies the need to impose an additional optimality requirement on the feasibility problem. This can be done through a primary cost function (e.g., administrative weight, hop count) according to which the selected feasible path is optimal. In general, multi-constrained path selection, with or without optimization, is an NP-complete problem that cannot be exactly solved in polynomial-time. Heuristics and approximation algorithms with polynomial and pseudo-polynomial-time complexities are often used to deal with this problem. However, existing solutions suffer either from excessive computational complexities that cannot be used for online network operation or from low performance. Moreover, they only deal with special cases of the problem (e.g., two constraints without optimization, one constraint with optimization, etc.). For the feasibility problem under multiple constraints, some researchers have proposed a nonlinear cost function whose minimization provides a continuous spectrum of solutions ranging from a generalized linear approximation (GLA) to an asymptotically exact solution. We propose an efficient heuristic algorithm for the most general form of the problem. We first formalize the theoretical properties of the above nonlinear cost function. We then introduce our heuristic algorithm (H MCOP), which attempts to minimize both the nonlinear cost function (for the feasibility part) and the primary cost function (for the optimality part). We prove that H MCOP guarantees at least the performance of GLA and often improves upon it. H MCOP has the same order of complexity as Dijkstra's algorithm. Using extensive simulations on random graphs with correlated and uncorrelated link weights, we show that under the same level of computational complexity, H MCOP outperforms its (less general) contenders in its success rate in finding feasible paths and in the cost of such paths},

Previous studies are mostly focused on single clustered network and coupled clustered networks with dependency links. Here we study two clustered networks coupled with both interdependent and interconnected links by introducing generating function of the joint degree distribution. When the networks are fully dependent, we obtain the analytical solution of giant component P ∞ . We show rich phase transition phenomena and analyze their behaviors. We find that, as dependency coupling strength increases, the system changes from second order phase transition through hybrid transition to first order phase transition. For weak dependency coupling strength q A , corresponding to second order phase transition, we find that, clustering has almost no effect on the robustness of network, but for strong dependency coupling strength q A , corresponding to first order transition, the more clustered system is more vulnerable. At the same time, we notice that when the system is more clustered, the hybrid order region is almost unchangeable, the first order region becomes smaller, and the second order region is larger. Additionally, we can see that, the bigger the clustering coefficient c is, the bigger the second order region becomes. For the same c, the density of connectivity links between networks is higher, the second order region becomes smaller, and the density of connectivity links within each network is higher, the second order region becomes bigger.},

abstract = {The Feedback Vertex Set problem (FVS), where the goal is to find a small subset of vertices that intersects every cycle in an input directed graph, is among the fundamental problems whose approximability is not well-understood. One can efficiently find an O(logn) factor approximation, and while a constant-factor approximation is ruled out under the Unique Games Conjecture (UGC), the best NP-hardness result is only a factor of about 1.36 (via a simple reduction from Vertex Cover). This work studies a natural variant of the Feedback Vertex Set problem (FVS), where the goal is to find a small subset of vertices that intersects every cycle of *bounded length*. For this variant, we prove strong *NP-hardness* of approximation results: For any integer constant k3 and 0, it is hard to find a (k−1−)-approximate solution to the problem of intersecting every cycle of length at most k. The hardness result almost matches the trivial factor k approximation algorithm for the problem. In fact, the hardness holds also for the problem of hitting every cycle of length at most a parameter kk where k can be taken to be (lognloglogn). Taking k=(lognloglogn) would be enough to prove a hardness for FVS (for arbitrary length cycles). Our work thus identifies the problem of hitting cycles of length logn as the key towards resolving the approximability of FVS. Our result is based on reductions from k-uniform Hypergraph Vertex Cover with random matching and labeling techniques. As byproducts of our techniques, we also prove a factor (k−1−) hardness of approximation result for k-Clique Transversal, where one must hit every k-clique in the graph with fewest possible vertices, and a factor (k) hardness result for finding a minimum-sized set of *edges* to hit all k-cycles. We also obtain almost tight (k) factor hardness results for the dual problem of packing vertex-disjoint k-cycles and k-cliques in a graph, albeit relying on the UGC for k-Cycle Packing (but we do get a weaker factor (k) NP-hardness result).},

We present a model in which information can reach a node via the links of the social network or through the influence of external sources. We then develop an efficient model parameter fitting technique and apply the model to the emergence of URL mentions in the Twitter network. Using a complete one month trace of Twitter we study how information reaches the nodes of the network. We quantify the external influences over time and describe how these influences affect the information adoption. We discover that the information tends to "jump" across the network, which can only be explained as an effect of an unobservable external influence on the network. We find that only about 71{\%} of the information volume in Twitter can be attributed to network diffusion, and the remaining 29{\%} is due to external events and factors outside the network. {\textcopyright} 2012 ACM.},

A number of issues arise in this transformation process, especially when analyzing ties among nodes' contacts. For example, the values attained by the global and local clustering coefficients on projected random two-mode networks deviate from the expected values in corresponding classical one-mode networks.

abstract = {Device-to-Device (D2D) communication has been recognized as a promising technique to offload the traffic for the evolved Node B (eNB). However, the D2D transmission as an underlay causes severe interference to both the cellular and other D2D links, which imposes a great technical challenge to radio resource allocation. Conventional graph based resource allocation methods typically consider the interference between two user equipments (UEs), but they cannot model the interference from multiple UEs to completely characterize the interference. In this paper, we study channel allocation using hypergraph theory to coordinate the interference between D2D pairs and cellular UEs, where an arbitrary number of D2D pairs are allowed to share the uplink channels with the cellular UEs. Hypergraph coloring is used to model the cumulative interference from multiple D2D pairs, and thus, eliminate the mutual interference. Simulation results show that the system capacity is significantly improved using the proposed hypergraph method in comparison to the conventional graph based one.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE. Information propagation in online social networks (OSNs), which helps shaping consumers' purchasing decisions, has received a lot of attention. The ultimate goal of marketing and advertising in OSNs is to massively influence audiences and enlarge the number of product adoptions. Most of existing works focus on maximizing the influence of a single product or promoting the adoption of one product in competing campaigns. However, in reality, the majority of companies produce various products for supplying customers with different needs. Therefore, it is truly significant and also challenging to wisely distribute limited budget across multiple products in viral marketing. In this paper, we investigate a Profit Maximization with Multiple Adoptions (PM2A) problem, which aims at maximizing the overall profit across all products. The natural greedy fails to provide a bounded result. In order to select high quality seeds for information propagation, we first proposed the PMCE algorithm, which has a ratio 1/2 (1 - 1/e2). Moreover, we further improve this ratio to (1-1/e) by proposing the PMIS algorithm. Comprehensive experiments on three real social networks are conducted. And results show that our algorithms outperform other heuristics, and better distribute the budget in terms of profit maximization.},

In this paper, we propose a holistic solution to the influence maximization (IM) problem. (1) We introduce an opinioncuminteraction (OI) model that closely mirrors the realworld scenarios. Under the OI model, we introduce a novel problem of Maximizing the Effective Opinion (MEO) of influenced users. We prove that the MEO problem is NPhard and cannot be approximated within a constant ratio unless P=NP. (2) We propose a heuristic algorithm OSIM to efficiently solve the MEO problem. To better explain the OSIM heuristic, we first introduce EaSyIM – the opinionoblivious version of OSIM, a scalable algorithm capable of running within practical compute times on commodity hardware. In addition to serving as a fundamental building block for OSIM, EaSyIM is capable of addressing the scalability aspect – memory consumption and running time, of the IM problem as well. Empirically, our algorithms are capable of maintaining the deviation in the spread always within 5{\%} of the best known methods in the literature. In addition, our experiments show that both OSIM and EaSyIM are effective, efficient, scalable and significantly enhance the ability to analyze real datasets.},

Recent advances in stochastic actor-based modeling, combined with self-reported data on a popular online social network site, allow us to address this question with a greater degree of precision than has heretofore been possible. Using data on the Facebook activity of a cohort of college students over 4 years, we find that students who share certain tastes in music and in movies, but not in books, are significantly likely to befriend one another. Meanwhile, we find little evidence for the diffusion of tastes among Facebook friends-except for tastes in classical/jazz music. These findings shed light on the mechanisms responsible for observed network homogeneity; provide a statistically rigorous assessment of the coevolution of cultural tastes and social relationships; and suggest important qualifications to our understanding of both homophily and contagion as generic social processes.},

abstract = {A repetitive sequence collection is a set of sequences which are small variations of each other. A prominent example are genome sequences of individuals of the same or close species, where the differences can be expressed by short lists of basic edit operations. Flexible and efficient data analysis on such a typically huge collection is plausible using suffix trees. However, the suffix tree occupies much space, which very soon inhibits in-memory analyses. Recent advances in full-text indexing reduce the space of the suffix tree to, essentially, that of the compressed sequences, while retaining its functionality with only a polylogarithmic slowdown. However, the underlying compression model considers only the predictability of the next sequence symbol given the k previous ones, where k is a small integer. This is unable to capture longer-term repetitiveness. For example, r identical copies of an incompressible sequence will be incompressible under this model. We develop new static and dynamic full-text indexes that are able of capturing the fact that a collection is highly repetitive, and require space basically proportional to the length of one typical sequence plus the total number of edit operations. The new indexes can be plugged into a recent dynamic fully-compressed suffix tree, achieving full functionality for sequence analysis, while retaining the reduced space and the polylogarithmic slowdown. Our experimental results confirm the practicality of our proposal.},

abstract = {Spreading dynamics of information and diseases are usually analyzed by using a unified framework and analogous models. In this paper, we propose a model to emphasize the essential difference between information spreading and epidemic spreading, where the memory effects, the social reinforcement and the non-redundancy of contacts are taken into account. Under certain conditions, the information spreads faster and broader in regular networks than in random networks, which to some extent supports the recent experimental observation of spreading in online society [D. Centola, Science {\{}$\backslash$bf 329{\}}, 1194 (2010)]. At the same time, simulation result indicates that the random networks tend to be favorable for effective spreading when the network size increases. This challenges the validity of the above-mentioned experiment for large-scale systems. More significantly, we show that the spreading effectiveness can be sharply enhanced by introducing a little randomness into the regular structure, namely the small-world networks yield the most effective information spreading. Our work provides insights to the understanding of the role of local clustering in information spreading.},

abstract = {heoretical models that social networks influence the suggest evolution of cooperation, but to date there have been few exper imental studies. Observational data suggest that a wide variety of behaviors may spread in human social networks, but subjects in such studies can choose to befriend people with similar behaviors, posing difficulty for causal inference. Here, we exploit a seminal set of laboratory experiments that originally showed that voluntary costly punishment can help sustain cooperation. In these experiments, subjects were randomly assigned to a sequence of different groups to play a series of single-shot public goods games with strangers; this feature allowed us to draw networks of interactions to explore how cooperative and uncooperative behaviors spread from person to person to person. We show that, in both an ordinary public goods game and in a public goods game with punishment focal individuals are influenced by fellow group members' contribution behavior in future interactions with other individuals who were not a party to the initial interaction. Furthermore, this influence persists for multiple periods and spreads up to three degrees of separation (f rpm person to person to person to person). The results suggest that each additional contribution a subject makes to the public good in the first period is tripled over the course of the experiment by other subjects who are directly or indirectly influenced to contribute more as a consequence. These results show experimentally that cooperative behavior cascades in human social netowrks.},

abstract = {In many real-world situations, different and often opposite opinions, innovations, or products are competing with one another for their social influence in a networked society. In this paper, we study competitive influence propagation in social networks under the competitive linear threshold (CLT) model, an extension to the classic linear threshold model. Under the CLT model, we focus on the problem that one entity tries to block the influence propagation of its competing entity as much as possible by strategically selecting a number of seed nodes that could initiate its own influence propagation. We call this problem the influence blocking maximization (IBM) problem. We prove that the objective function of IBM in the CLT model is submodular, and thus a greedy algorithm could achieve 1-1/e approximation ratio. However, the greedy algorithm requires Monte-Carlo simulations of competitive influence propagation, which makes the algorithm not efficient. We design an efficient algorithm CLDAG, which utilizes the properties of the CLT model, to address this issue. We conduct extensive simulations of CLDAG, the greedy algorithm, and other baseline algorithms on real-world and synthetic datasets. Our results show that CLDAG is able to provide best accuracy in par with the greedy algorithm and often better than other algorithms, while it is two orders of magnitude faster than the greedy algorithm.},

abstract = {In online social media systems users are not only posting, consuming, and resharing content, but also creating new and destroying existing connections in the underlying social network. While each of these two types of dynamics has individually been studied in the past, much less is known about the connection between the two. How does user information posting and seeking behavior interact with the evolution of the underlying social network structure? Here, we study ways in which network structure reacts to users posting and sharing content. We examine the complete dynamics of the Twitter information network, where users post and reshare information while they also create and destroy connections. We find that the dynamics of network structure can be characterized by steady rates of change, interrupted by sudden bursts. Information diffusion in the form of cascades of post re-sharing often creates such sudden bursts of new connections, which significantly change users' local network structure. These bursts transform users' networks of followers to become structurally more cohesive as well as more homogenous in terms of follower interests. We also explore the effect of the information content on the dynamics of the network and find evidence that the appearance of new topics and real-world events can lead to significant changes in edge creations and deletions. Lastly, we develop a model that quantifies the dynamics of the network and the occurrence of these bursts as a function of the information spreading through the network. The model can successfully predict which information diffusion events will lead to bursts in network dynamics.},

@article{Ran2015,
abstract = {The largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of a network (referred to as the spectral radius) is an important metric in its own right. Further, for several models of epidemic spread on networks (e.g., the ‘flu-like' SISmodel), it has been shown that an epidemic dies out quickly if the spectral radius of the graph is below a certain threshold that depends on themodel parameters. This motivates a strategy to control epidemic spread by reducing the spectral radius of the underlying network. In this paper, we develop a suite of provable approxima- tion algorithms for reducing the spectral radius by removing the minimum cost set of edges (modeling quarantining) or nodes (modeling vaccinations), with different time and qual- ity tradeoffs. Our main algorithm, GreedyWalk, is based on the idea of hitting closed walks of a given length, and gives an O(log2 n)-approximation, where n denotes the number of nodes; it also performs much better in practice compared to all prior heuristics proposed for this problem. We further present a novel sparsification method to improve its running time. In addition, we give a new primal-dual based algorithm with an even better approximation guarantee (O(log n)), albeit with slower running time. We also give lower bounds on the worst-case performance of some of the popular heuristics. Finally we demonstrate the applicability of our algorithms and the properties of our solutions via extensive experiments on multiple synthetic and real networks},

abstract = {The majority of influence maximization (IM) studies focus on targeting influential seeders to trigger substantial information spread in social networks. In this paper, we consider a new and complementary problem of how to further increase the influence spread of given seeders. Our study is motivated by the observation that direct incentives could "boost" users so that they are more likely to be influenced by friends. We study the {\$}k{\$}-boosting problem which aims to find {\$}k{\$} users to boost so that the final "boosted" influence spread is maximized. The {\$}k{\$}-boosting problem is different from the IM problem because boosted users behave differently from seeders: boosted users are initially uninfluenced and we only increase their probability to be influenced. Our work also complements the IM studies because we focus on triggering larger influence spread on the basis of given seeders. Both the NP-hardness of the problem and the non-submodularity of the objective function pose challenges to the {\$}k{\$}-boosting problem. To tackle the problem on general graphs, we devise two efficient algorithms with the data-dependent approximation ratio. For the {\$}k{\$}-boosting problem on bidirected trees, we present an efficient greedy algorithm and a rounded dynamic programming that is a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme. We conduct extensive experiments using real social networks and synthetic bidirected trees. We show that boosting solutions returned by our algorithms achieves boosts of influence that are up to several times higher than those achieved by boosting solutions returned by intuitive baselines, which have no guarantee of solution quality. We also explore the "budget allocation" problem in our experiments. Compared with targeting seeders with all budget, larger influence spread is achieved when we allocation the budget to both seeders and boosted users.},

abstract = {Shannon's entropy is a clear lower bound for statistical compression. The situation is not so well understood for dictionary-based compression. A plausible lower bound is b, the least number of phrases of a general bidirectional parse of a text, where phrases can be copied from anywhere else in the text. Since computing b is NP-complete, a popular gold standard is z, the number of phrases in the Lempel-Ziv parse of the text, which is the optimal one when phrases can be copied only from the left. While z can be computed in linear time with a greedy algorithm, almost nothing has been known for decades about its approximation ratio with respect to b. In this paper we prove that z = O(b log(n/b)), where n is the text length. We also show that the bound is tight as a function of n, by exhibiting a string family where z = {\{}$\backslash$Omega{\}}(b log n). Our upper bound is obtained by building a run-length context-free grammar based on a locally consistent parsing of the text. Our lower bound is obtained by relating b with r, the number of equal-letter runs in the Burrows-Wheeler transform of the text. We proceed by observing that Lempel-Ziv is just one particular case of greedy parse, and introduce a new parse where phrases can only be copied from lexicographically smaller text locations. We prove that the size v of the smallest parse of this kind has properties similar to z, including the same approximation ratio with respect to b. Interestingly, we also show that v = O(r), whereas r = o(z) holds on some particular classes of strings. On our way, we prove other relevant bounds between compressibility measures.},

abstract = {A topic propagating in a social network reaches its tipping point if the number of users discussing it in the network exceeds a critical threshold such that a wide cascade on the topic is likely to occur. In this paper, we consider the task of selecting initial seed users of a topic with minimum size so that {\{}$\backslash$em with a guaranteed probability{\}} the number of users discussing the topic would reach a given threshold. We formulate the task as an optimization problem called {\{}$\backslash$em seed minimization with probabilistic coverage guarantee (SM-PCG){\}}. This problem departs from the previous studies on social influence maximization or seed minimization because it considers influence coverage with {\{}$\backslash$em probabilistic{\}} guarantees instead of guarantees on {\{}$\backslash$em expected{\}} influence coverage. We show that the problem is not submodular, and thus is harder than previously studied problems based on submodular function optimization. We provide an approximation algorithm and show that it approximates the optimal solution with both a multiplicative ratio and an additive error. The multiplicative ratio is tight while the additive error would be small if influence coverage distributions of certain seed sets are well concentrated. For one-way bipartite graphs we analytically prove the concentration condition and obtain an approximation algorithm with an {\$}O(\backslashlog n){\$} multiplicative ratio and an {\$}O(\backslashsqrt{\{}n{\}}){\$} additive error, where {\$}n{\$} is the total number of nodes in the social graph. Moreover, we empirically verify the concentration condition in real-world networks and experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm comparing to commonly adopted benchmark algorithms.},

abstract = {The function of a real network depends not only on the reliability of its own components, but is affected also by the simultaneous operation of other real networks coupled with it. Robustness of systems composed of interdependent network layers has been extensively studied in recent years. However, the theoretical frameworks developed so far apply only to special models in the limit of infinite sizes. These methods are therefore of little help in practical contexts, given that real interconnected networks have finite size and their structures are generally not compatible with those of graph toy models. Here, we introduce a theoretical method that takes as inputs the adjacency matrices of the layers to draw the entire phase diagram for the interconnected network, without the need of actually simulating any percolation process. We demonstrate that percolation transitions in arbitrary interdependent networks can be understood by decomposing these system into uncoupled graphs: the intersection among the layers, and the remainders of the layers. When the intersection dominates the remainders, an interconnected network undergoes a continuous percolation transition. Conversely, if the intersection is dominated by the contribution of the remainders, the transition becomes abrupt even in systems of finite size. We provide examples of real systems that have developed interdependent networks sharing a core of "high quality" edges to prevent catastrophic failures.},

abstract = {Recent advances in the study of networked systems have highlighted that our interconnected world is composed of networks that are coupled to each other through different ‘layers' that each represent one of many possible subsystems or types of interactions. Nevertheless, it is traditional to aggregate multilayer networks into a single weighted network in order to take advantage of existing tools. This is admittedly convenient, but it is also extremely problematic, as important information can be lost as a result. It is therefore important to develop multilayer generalizations of network concepts. In this paper, we analyze triadic relations and generalize the idea of transitivity to multiplex networks. By focusing on triadic relations, which yield the simplest type of transitivity, we generalize the concept and computation of clustering coefficients to multiplex networks. We show how the layered structure of such networks introduces a new degree of freedom that has a fundamental effect on transitivity. We compute multiplex clustering coefficients for several real multiplex networks and illustrate why one must take great care when generalizing standard network concepts to multiplex networks. We also derive analytical expressions for our clustering coefficients for ensemble averages of networks in a family of random multiplex networks. Our analysis illustrates that social networks have a strong tendency to promote redundancy by closing triads at every layer and that they thereby have a different type of multiplex transitivity from transportation networks, which do not exhibit such a tendency. These insights are invisible if one only studies aggregated networks.},

abstract = {In this paper, we develop a formal framework for what a good community should look like and how strong a community is (community strength). One of the key innovations is to incorporate the concept of relative centrality into structural analysis of networks. In our framework, relative centrality is a measure that measures how important a set of nodes in a network is with respect to another set of nodes, and it is a generalization of centrality. Building on top of relative centrality, the community strength for a set of nodes is measured by the difference between its relative centrality with respect to itself and its centrality. A community is then a set of nodes with a nonnegative community strength. We show that our community strength is related to conductance that is commonly used for measuring the strength of a small community. We define the modularity for a partition of a network as the average community strength for a randomly selected node. Such a definition generalizes the original Newman's modularity and recovers the stability in as special cases. For the local community detection problem, we also develop efficient agglomerative algorithms that guarantee the community strength of the detected local community.},

abstract = {With the rapid advances of sensing technologies and wireless communications, large amounts of dynamic data pertaining to industrial production are being collected from many sensor nodes deployed in the industrial Internet of Things. Analyzing those data effectively can help to improve the industrial services and mitigate the system unprepared breakdowns. As an important technique of data analysis, clustering attempts to find the underlying pattern structures embedded in unlabeled information. Unfortunately, most of the current clustering techniques that could only deal with static data become infeasible to cluster a significant volume of data in the dynamic industrial applications. To tackle this problem, an incremental clustering algorithm by fast finding and searching of density peaks based on k-mediods is proposed in this paper. In the proposed algorithm, two cluster operations, namely cluster creating and cluster merging, are defined to integrate the current pattern into the previous one for the final clustering result, and k-mediods is employed to modify the clustering centers according to the new arriving objects. Finally, experiments are conducted to validate the proposed scheme on three popular UCI datasets and two real datasets collected from industrial Internet of Things in terms of clustering accuracy and computational time.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of maximizing a nonnegative (possibly non-monotone) submodular set function with or without constraints. Feige et al. [FOCS'07] showed a 2/5-approximation for the unconstrained problem and also proved that no approximation better than 1/2 is possible in the value oracle model. Constant-factor approximation was also given for submodular maximization subject to a matroid independence constraint (a factor of 0.309 Vondrak [FOCS'09]) and for submodular maximization subject to a matroid base constraint, provided that the fractional base packing number is at least 2 (a 1/4-approximation, Vondrak [FOCS'09]). In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for submodular maximization which is based on the idea of {\{}$\backslash$em simulated annealing{\}}. We prove that this algorithm achieves improved approximation for two problems: a 0.41-approximation for unconstrained submodular maximization, and a 0.325-approximation for submodular maximization subject to a matroid independence constraint. On the hardness side, we show that in the value oracle model it is impossible to achieve a 0.478-approximation for submodular maximization subject to a matroid independence constraint, or a 0.394-approximation subject to a matroid base constraint in matroids with two disjoint bases. Even for the special case of cardinality constraint, we prove it is impossible to achieve a 0.491-approximation. (Previously it was conceivable that a 1/2-approximation exists for these problems.) It is still an open question whether a 1/2-approximation is possible for unconstrained submodular maximization.},

abstract = {Trophic coherence, a measure of the extent to which the nodes of a directed network are organised in levels, has recently been shown to be closely related to many structural and dynamical aspects of complex systems, including graph eigenspectra, the prevalence or absence of feed-back cycles, and linear stability. Furthermore, non-trivial trophic structures have been observed in networks of neurons, species, genes, metabolites, cellular signalling, concatenated words, P2P users, and world trade. Here we consider two simple yet apparently quite different dynamical models -- one a Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) epidemic model adapted to include complex contagion, the other an Amari-Hopfield neural network -- and show that in both cases the related spreading processes are modulated in similar ways by the trophic coherence of the underlying networks. To do this, we propose a network assembly model which can generate structures with tunable trophic coherence, limiting in either perfectly stratified networks or random graphs. We find that trophic coherence can exert a qualitative change in spreading behaviour, determining whether a pulse of activity will percolate through the entire network or remain confined to a subset of nodes, and whether such activity will quickly die out or endure indefinitely. These results could be important for our understanding of phenomena such as epidemics, rumours, shocks to ecosystems, neuronal avalanches, and many other spreading processes.},

abstract = {Background To maintain the balance between the demand of the body and supply (cardiac output), cardiac performance is tightly regulated via the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems. In heart failure, cardiac output (supply) is decreased due to pathologic remodeling of the heart. To meet the demands of the body, the sympathetic system is activated and catecholamines stimulate $\beta$-adrenergic receptors ($\beta$-ARs) to increase contractile performance and cardiac output. Although this is beneficial in the acute phase, chronic $\beta$-ARs stimulation initiates a cascade of alterations at the cellular level, resulting in a diminished contractile performance of the heart.},

abstract = {We propose an external memory algorithm for the computation of the BWT and LCP array for a collection of sequences. Our algorithm takes the amount of available memory as an input parameter, and tries to make the best use of it by splitting the input collection into subcollections sufficiently small that it can compute their BWT in RAM using an optimal linear time algorithm. Next, it merges the partial BWTs in external memory and in the process it also computes the LCP values. We prove that our algorithm performs O(n AveLcp) sequential I/Os, where n is the total length of the collection, and AveLcp is the average Longest Common Prefix of the collection. This bound is an improvement over the known algorithms for the same task. The experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms the current best algorithm for collections of sequences with different lengths and for collections with relatively small average Longest Common Prefix. In the second part of the paper, we show that our algorithm can be modified to output two additional arrays that, used with the BWT and LCP arrays, provide simple, scan based, external memory algorithms for three well known problems in bioinformatics: the computation of maximal repeats, the all pairs suffix-prefix overlaps, and the construction of succinct de Bruijn graphs. To our knowledge, there are no other known external memory algorithms for these problems.},

Many times the collected network data is incomplete with nodes and edges missing. Com- monly, only a part of the network can be observed and we would like to infer the unobserved part of the network. We address this issue by studying the Network Completion Problem: Given a network with missing nodes and edges, can we complete the missing part? We cast the problem in the Expectation Maximization (EM) framework where we use the observed part of the network to fit a model of network structure, and then we estimate the missing part of the network us- ing the model, re-estimate the parameters and so on. We combine the EM with the Kronecker graphs model and design a scalable Metropolized Gibbs sampling ap- proach that allows for the estimation of the model pa- rameters as well as the inference about missing nodes and edges of the network. Experiments on synthetic and several real-world networks show that our approach can effectively recover the network even when about half of the nodes in the network are missing. Our algorithm outperforms not only classical link-prediction approaches but also the state of the art Stochastic block modeling approach. Furthermore, our algorithm easily scales to networks with tens of thousands of nodes.},

@article{Cohen2015,
abstract = {Graph datasets with billions of edges, such as social and Web graphs, are prevalent. To be feasible, computation on such large graphs should scale linearly with graph size. All-distances sketches (ADSs) are emerging as a powerful tool for scalable computation of some basic properties of individual nodes or the whole graph. ADSs were first proposed two decades ago (Cohen 1994) and more recent algorithms include ANF (Palmer, Gibbons, and Faloutsos 2002) and hyperANF (Boldi, Rosa, and Vigna 2011). A sketch of logarithmic size is computed for each node in the graph and the computation in total requires only a near linear number of edge relaxations. From the ADS of a node, we can estimate its neighborhood cardinalities (the number of nodes within some query distance) and closeness centrality. We make several contributions. We provide, for the first time, a unified exposition of ADS algorithms and applications. We present the Historic Inverse Probability (HIP) estimators which are applied to the ADS of a node to estimate a large natural class of queries including neighborhood cardinalities and closeness centralities. We show that our HIP estimators have at most half the variance of previous neighborhood cardinality estimators and that this is essentially optimal. Moreover, HIP obtains a polynomial improvement for more general queries and the estimators are simple, flexible, unbiased, and elegant. We apply HIP for approximate distinct counting on streams by comparing HIP and the original estimators applied to the HyperLogLog Min-Hash sketches (Flajolet et al. 2007). We demonstrate significant improvement in estimation quality for this state-of-the-art practical algorithm and also illustrate the ease of applying HIP. Finally, we study the quality of ADS estimation of distance ranges, generalizing the near-linear time factor-2 approximation of the diameter.},

This influence estimation problem is very challenging since both the time-sensitive nature of the problem and the issue of scalability need to be addressed simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a randomized algorithm for influence estimation in continuous-time diffusion networks. Our algorithm can estimate the influence of every node in a network with |$\backslash$Vcal| nodes and |$\backslash$Ecal| edges to an accuracy of ϵ using n=O(1/ϵ2) randomizations and up to logarithmic factors O(n|$\backslash$Ecal|+n|$\backslash$Vcal|) computations. When used as a subroutine in a greedy influence maximization algorithm, our proposed method is guaranteed to find a set of nodes with an influence of at least (1−1/e)OPT−2ϵ, where OPT is the optimal value. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data show that the proposed method can easily scale up to networks of millions of nodes while significantly improves over previous state-of-the-arts in terms of the accuracy of the estimated influence and the quality of the selected nodes in maximizing the influence.},

abstract = {Indexing highly repetitive texts --- such as genomic databases, software repositories and versioned text collections --- has become an important problem since the turn of the millennium. A relevant compressibility measure for repetitive texts is {\$}r{\$}, the number of runs in their Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT). One of the earliest indexes for repetitive collections, the Run-Length FM-index, used {\$}O(r){\$} space and was able to efficiently count the number of occurrences of a pattern of length {\$}m{\$} in the text (in loglogarithmic time per pattern symbol, with current techniques). However, it was unable to locate the positions of those occurrences efficiently within a space bounded in terms of {\$}r{\$}. Since then, a number of other indexes with space bounded by other measures of repetitiveness --- the number of phrases in the Lempel-Ziv parse, the size of the smallest grammar generating the text, the size of the smallest automaton recognizing the text factors --- have been proposed for efficiently locating, but not directly counting, the occurrences of a pattern. In this paper we close this long-standing problem, showing how to extend the Run-Length FM-index so that it can locate the {\$}occ{\$} occurrences efficiently within {\$}O(r){\$} space (in loglogarithmic time each), and reaching optimal time {\$}O(m+occ){\$} within {\$}O(r\backslashlog(n/r)){\$} space, on a RAM machine of {\$}w=\backslashOmega(\backslashlog n){\$} bits. Within {\$}O(r\backslashlog (n/r)){\$} space, our index can also count in optimal time {\$}O(m){\$}. Raising the space to {\$}O(r w\backslashlog{\_}\backslashsigma(n/r)){\$}, we support count and locate in {\$}O(m\backslashlog(\backslashsigma)/w){\$} and {\$}O(m\backslashlog(\backslashsigma)/w+occ){\$} time, which is optimal in the packed setting and had not been obtained before in compressed space. We also describe a structure using {\$}O(r\backslashlog(n/r)){\$} space that replaces the text and extracts any text substring of length {\$}\backslashell{\$} in almost-optimal time {\$}O(\backslashlog(n/r)+\backslashell\backslashlog(\backslashsigma)/w){\$}.

Our algorithm is based on a replacement paths algorithm proposed by Hershberger and Suri [2001], and can yield a factor {\&}Theta;( n ) improvement for this problem. But there is a caveat: The fast replacement paths subroutine is known to fail for some directed graphs. However, the failure is easily detected, and so our k shortest paths algorithm optimistically uses the fast subroutine, then switches to a slower but correct algorithm if a failure is detected. Thus, the algorithm achieves its {\&}Theta;( n ) speed advantage only when the optimism is justified. Our empirical results show that the replacement paths failure is a rare phenomenon, and the new algorithm outperforms the current best algorithms; the improvement can be substantial in large graphs. For instance, on GIS map data with about 5,000 nodes and 12,000 edges, our algorithm is 4--8 times faster. In synthetic graphs modeling wireless ad hoc networks, our algorithm is about 20 times faster.},

Recently, motivated by the design of viral marketing strategies, Domingos and Richardson posed a fundamental algorithmic problem for such social network processes: if we can try to convince a subset of individuals to adopt a new product or innovation, and the goal is to trigger a large cascade of further adoptions, which set of individuals should we target? We consider this problem in several of the most widely studied models in social network analysis. The optimization problem of selecting the most influential nodes is NP-hard here, and we provide the first provable approximation guarantees for efficient algorithms. Using an analysis framework based on submodular functions, we show that a natural greedy strategy obtains a solution that is provably within 63{\%} of optimal for several classes of models; our framework suggests a general approach for reasoning about the performance guarantees of algorithms for these types of influence problems in social networks. We also provide computational experiments on large collaboration networks, showing that in addition to their provable guarantees, our approximation algorithms significantly out-perform nodeselection heuristics based on the well-studied notions of degree centrality and distance centrality from the field of social networks.},

A key concept is introduced, the edge multiplicity, that measures the number of triangles passing through an edge. This quantity extends the clustering coefficient in that it involves the properties of two-and not just one-vertices. The formalism is completed with the definition of a three-vertex correlation function, which is the fundamental quantity describing the properties of clustered networks. The formalism suggests different metrics that are able to thoroughly characterize transitive relations. A rigorous analysis of several real networks, which makes use of this formalism and the metrics, is also provided. It is also found that clustered networks can be classified into two main groups: the weak and the strong transitivity classes. In the first class, edge multiplicity is small, with triangles being disjoint. In the second class, edge multiplicity is high and so triangles share many edges. As we shall see in the following paper, the class a network belongs to has strong implications in its percolation properties.},

abstract = {IEEE Network measures derived from empirical observations are often poor estimators of the true structure of system as it is impossible to observe all components and all interactions in many real world complex systems. Here, we study attack robustness of complex networks with data missing caused by: 1) a uniform random sampling and 2) a nonuniform random sampling. By introducing the subgraph robustness problem, we develop analytically a framework to investigate robustness properties of the two types of subgraphs under random attacks, localized attacks, and targeted attacks. Interestingly, we find that the benchmark models, such as Erd {\&} {\#}x0151;s-R {\&} {\#}x00E9;nyi graphs, random regular networks, and scale-free networks possess distinct characteristic subgraph robustness features. We show that the network robustness depends on several factors including network topology, attack mode, sampling method and the amount of data missing, generalizing some well-known robustness principles of complex networks. Our results offer insight into the structural effect of missing data in networks and highlight the significance of understanding different sampling processes and their consequences on attack robustness, which may be instrumental in designing robust systems.},

abstract = {In the {\{}$\backslash$em capacitated{\}} survivable network design problem (Cap-SNDP), we are given an undirected multi-graph where each edge has a capacity and a cost. The goal is to find a minimum cost subset of edges that satisfies a given set of pairwise minimum-cut requirements. Unlike its classical special case of SNDP when all capacities are unit, the approximability of Cap-SNDP is not well understood; even in very restricted settings no known algorithm achieves a {\$}o(m){\$} approximation, where {\$}m{\$} is the number of edges in the graph.

abstract = {To explore the advantages of power saving offered by the wireless multicast advantage property, we consider the case of source-initiated multicast traffic. Current research activity for the minimum energy multicast (MEM) problem has been focused on devising efficient centralized greedy algorithms for static ad hoc networks. In this paper, we consider mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) that use omnidirectional antennas and have limited energy resources. We propose the design and initial evaluation of the distributed minimum energy multicast (DMEM) algorithm for MANETs that attempts to reduce as much as possible the total RF energy required by the multicast communication. Several localized operations are presented for the DMEM algorithm, in which each node requires only the knowledge of and distances to all neighboring tree nodes. Through extensive simulation studies, we show that these operations are very efficient both in terms of energy saving and operation overhead},

In particular, for these datasets, we construct and investigate the retweet graphs. We find that the retweet graph for a trending topic has a relatively dense largest connected component (LCC). Next, based on the insights obtained from the analyses of the datasets, we design a mathematical model that describes the evolution of a retweet graph by three main parameters. We then quantify, analytically and by simulation, the influence of the model parameters on the basic characteristics of the retweet graph, such as the density of edges and the size and density of the LCC. Finally, we put the model in practice, estimate its parameters and compare the resulting behavior of the model to our datasets.},

ESGD combines SGD and gradient-free evolutionary algorithms as complementary algorithms in one framework in which the optimization alternates between the SGD step and evolution step to improve the average fitness of the population. With a back-off strategy in the SGD step and an elitist strategy in the evolution step, it guarantees that the best fitness in the population will never degrade. In addition, individuals in the population optimized with various SGD-based optimizers using distinct hyper-parameters in the SGD step are considered as competing species in a coevolution setting such that the complementarity of the optimizers is also taken into account. The effectiveness of ESGD is demonstrated across multiple applications including speech recognition, image recognition and language modeling, using networks with a variety of deep architectures.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Social media are dynamic and interactive computer-mediated communication tools that have high penetration rates in the general population in high-income and middle-income countries. However, in medicine and health care, a large number of stakeholders (eg, clinicians, administrators, professional colleges, academic institutions, ministries of health, among others) are unaware of social media's relevance, potential applications in their day-to-day activities, as well as the inherent risks and how these may be attenuated and mitigated. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a narrative review with the aim to present case studies that illustrate how, where, and why social media are being used in the medical and health care sectors. METHODS: Using a critical-interpretivist framework, we used qualitative methods to synthesize the impact and illustrate, explain, and provide contextual knowledge of the applications and potential implementations of social media in medicine and health care. Both traditional (eg, peer-reviewed) and nontraditional (eg, policies, case studies, and social media content) sources were used, in addition to an environmental scan (using Google and Bing Web searches) of resources. RESULTS: We reviewed, evaluated, and synthesized 76 articles, 44 websites, and 11 policies/reports. Results and case studies are presented according to 10 different categories of social media: (1) blogs (eg, WordPress), (2) microblogs (eg, Twitter), (3) social networking sites (eg, Facebook), (4) professional networking sites (eg, LinkedIn, Sermo), (5) thematic networking sites (eg, 23andMe), (6) wikis (eg, Wikipedia), (7) mashups (eg, HealthMap), (8) collaborative filtering sites (eg, Digg), (9) media sharing sites (eg, YouTube, Slideshare), and others (eg, SecondLife). Four recommendations are provided and explained for stakeholders wishing to engage with social media while attenuating risk: (1) maintain professionalism at all times, (2) be authentic, have fun, and do not be afraid, (3) ask for help, and (4) focus, grab attention, and engage. CONCLUSIONS: The role of social media in the medical and health care sectors is far reaching, and many questions in terms of governance, ethics, professionalism, privacy, confidentiality, and information quality remain unanswered. By following the guidelines presented, professionals have a starting point to engage with social media in a safe and ethical manner. Future research will be required to understand the synergies between social media and evidence-based practice, as well as develop institutional policies that benefit patients, clinicians, public health practitioners, and industry alike.},

abstract = {Bootstrap percolation is a well-known activation process in a graph, in which a node becomes active when it has at least {\$}r{\$} active neighbors. Such process, originally studied on regular structures, has been recently investigated also in the context of random graphs, where it can serve as a simple model for a wide variety of cascades, such as the spreading of ideas, trends, viral contents, etc. over large social networks. In particular, it has been shown that in {\$}G(n,p){\$} the final active set can exhibit a phase transition for a sub-linear number of seeds. In this paper, we propose a unique framework to study similar sub-linear phase transitions for a much broader class of graph models and epidemic processes. Specifically, we consider i) a generalized version of bootstrap percolation in {\$}G(n,p){\$} with random activation thresholds and random node-to-node influences; ii) different random graph models, including graphs with given degree sequence and graphs with community structure (block model). The common thread of our work is to show the surprising sensitivity of the critical seed set size to extreme values of distributions, which makes some systems dramatically vulnerable to large-scale outbreaks. We validate our results running simulation on both synthetic and real graphs.},

abstract = {Some epidemic spreading models are usually applied to analyze the propagation of opinions or news. However, the dynamics of epidemic spreading and information or behavior spreading are essentially different in many aspects. Centola's experiments [Science 329, 1194 (2010)] on behavior spreading in online social networks showed that the spreading is faster and broader in regular networks than in random networks. This result contradicts with the former understanding that random networks are preferable for spreading than regular networks. To describe the spreading in online social networks, a unknown-known-approved-exhausted four-status model was proposed, which emphasizes the effect of social reinforcement and assumes that the redundant signals can improve the probability of approval (i.e., the spreading rate). Performing the model on regular and random networks, it is found that our model can well explain the results of Centola's experiments on behavior spreading and some former studies on information spreading in different parameter space. The effects of average degree and network size on behavior spreading process are further analyzed. The results again show the importance of social reinforcement and are accordant with Centola's anticipation that increasing the network size or decreasing the average degree will enlarge the difference of the density of final approved nodes between regular and random networks. Our work complements the former studies on spreading dynamics, especially the spreading in online social networks where the information usually requires individuals' confirmations before being transmitted to others.},

abstract = {The whole frame of interconnections in complex networks hinges on a specific set of structural nodes, much smaller than the total size, which, if activated, would cause the spread of information to the whole network, or, if immunized, would prevent the diffusion of a large scale epidemic. Localizing this optimal, that is, minimal, set of structural nodes, called influencers, is one of the most important problems in network science. Despite the vast use of heuristic strategies to identify influential spreaders, the problem remains unsolved. Here we map the problem onto optimal percolation in random networks to identify the minimal set of influencers, which arises by minimizing the energy of a many-body system, where the form of the interactions is fixed by the non-backtracking matrix of the network. Big data analyses reveal that the set of optimal influencers is much smaller than the one predicted by previous heuristic centralities. Remarkably, a large number of previously neglected weakly connected nodes emerges among the optimal influencers. These are topologically tagged as low-degree nodes surrounded by hierarchical coronas of hubs, and are uncovered only through the optimal collective interplay of all the influencers in the network. The present theoretical framework may hold a larger degree of universality, being applicable to other hard optimization problems exhibiting a continuous transition from a known phase.},

abstract = {Vulnerability analysis on the power grid has been widely conducted from the substation-only and transmission-line-only perspectives. In order words, it is considered that attacks can occur on substations or transmission lines separately. In this paper, we naturally extend existing two perspectives and introduce the joint-substation-transmission-line's perspective, which means attacks can concurrently occur on substations and transmission lines. Vulnerabilities are referred to as these multiple-component combinations that can yield large damage to the power grid. One such combination consists of substations, transmission lines, or both. The new perspective is promising to discover more power grid vulnerabilities. In particular, we conduct the vulnerability analysis on the IEEE 39 bus system. Compared with known substation-only/transmission-line-only vulnerabilities, joint-substation-transmission-line vulnerabilities account for the largest percentage. Referring to three-component vulnerabilities, for instance, joint-substation-transmission-line vulnerabilities account for 76.06{\%}; substation-only and transmission-line-only vulnerabilities account for 10.96{\%} and 12.98{\%}, respectively. In addition, we adopt two existing metrics, degree and load, to study the joint-substation-transmission-line attack strategy. Generally speaking, the joint-substation-transmission-line attack strategy based on the load metric has better attack performance than comparison schemes.},

We then develop STRICT, an efficient algorithm for selecting examples to teach to workers. Our solution greedily maximizes a submodular surrogate objective function in order to select examples to show to the learners. We prove that our strategy is competitive with the optimal teaching policy. Moreover, for the special case of linear separators, we prove that an exponential reduction in error probability can be achieved.

However, it is difficult to accommodate variations in the number of contacts, clustering coefficient and assortativity. Investigations of the relationship between these properties and epidemic behaviour have led to inconsistent conclusions and have not accounted for their interrelationship. In this study, simulation is used to estimate the impact of social network structure on the probability of an SIR (susceptible-infective-removed) epidemic occurring and, if it does, the final size. Increases in assortativity and clustering coefficient are associated with smaller epidemics and the impact is cumulative. Derived values of the basic reproduction ratio (R0) over networks with the highest property values are more than 20{\%} lower than those derived from simulations with zero values of these network properties. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Balanced partitioning is often a crucial first step in solving large-scale graph optimization problems: in some cases, a big graph is chopped into pieces that fit on one machine to be processed independently before stitching the results together, leading to certain suboptimality from the interaction among different pieces. In other cases, links between different parts may show up in the running time and/or network communications cost, hence the desire to have small cut size. We study a distributed balanced partitioning problem where the goal is to partition the vertices of a given graph into k pieces, minimizing the total cut size. Our algorithm is composed of a few steps that are easily implementable in distributed computation frameworks, e.g., MapReduce. The algorithm first embeds nodes of the graph onto a line, and then processes nodes in a distributed manner guided by the linear embedding order. We examine various ways to find the first embedding, e.g., via a hierarchical clustering or Hilbert curves. Then we apply four different techniques such as local swaps, minimum cuts on partition boundaries, as well as contraction and dynamic programming. Our empirical study compares the above techniques with each other, and to previous work in distributed algorithms, e.g., a label propagation method [34], FENNEL [32] and Spinner [23]. We report our results both on a private map graph and several public social networks, and show that our results beat previous distributed algorithms: we notice, e.g., 15-25{\%} reduction in cut size over [34]. We also observe that our algorithms allow for scalable distributed implementation for any number of partitions. Finally, we apply our techniques for the Google Maps Driving Directions to minimize the number of multi-shard queries with the goal of saving in CPU usage. During live experiments, we observe an ≈ 40{\%} drop in the number of multi-shard queries when comparing our method with a standard geography-based method. {\textcopyright} 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract = {The problem of selecting a group of vertices under certain constraints that maximize their joint centrality arises in many practical scenarios. In this paper, we extend the notion of current flow close-ness centrality (CFCC) to a set of vertices in a graph, and investigate the problem of selecting a subset S to maximizes its CFCC C(S), with the cardinality constraint |S | = k. We show the NP-hardness of the problem, but propose two greedy algorithms to minimize the reciprocal of C(S). We prove the approximation ratios by showing the monotonicity and supermodularity. A proposed deterministic greedy algorithm has an approximation factor (1 − k k−1 {\textperiodcentered} 1 e) and cubic running time. To compare with, a proposed randomized algorithm gives (1 − k k −1 {\textperiodcentered} 1 e − ϵ)-approximation in nearly-linear time, for any ϵ {\textgreater} 0. Extensive experiments on model and real networks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms , with the randomized algorithm being applied to massive networks with more than a million vertices.},

abstract = {This book provides a complete and comprehensive reference/guide to Pyomo (Python Optimization Modeling Objects) for both beginning and advanced modelers, including students at the undergraduate and graduate levels, academic researchers, and practitioners. The text illustrates the breadth of the modeling and analysis capabilities that are supported by the software and support of complex real-world applications. Pyomo is an open source software package for formulating and solving large-scale optimization and operations research problems. The text begins with a tutorial on simple linear and integer programming models. A detailed reference of Pyomo's modeling components is illustrated with extensive examples, including a discussion of how to load data from data sources like spreadsheets and databases. Chapters describing advanced modeling capabilities for nonlinear and stochastic optimization are also included. The Pyomo software provides familiar modeling features within Python, a powerful dynamic programming language that has a very clear, readable syntax and intuitive object orientation. Pyomo includes Python classes for defining sparse sets, parameters, and variables, which can be used to formulate algebraic expressions that define objectives and constraints. Moreover, Pyomo can be used from a command-line interface and within Python's interactive command environment, which makes it easy to create Pyomo models, apply a variety of optimizers, and examine solutions. The software supports a different modeling approach than commercial AML (Algebraic Modeling Languages) tools, and is designed for flexibility, extensibility, portability, and maintainability but also maintains the central ideas in modern AMLs.},

abstract = {Many social networks and complex systems are found to be naturally divided into clusters of densely connected nodes, known as community structure (CS). Finding CS is one of fundamental yet challenging topics in network science. One of the most popular classes of methods for this problem is to maximize Newman's modularity. However, there is a little understood on how well we can approximate the maximum modularity as well as the implications of finding community structure with provable guarantees. In this paper, we settle definitely the approximability of modularity clustering, proving that approximating the problem within any (multiplicative) positive factor is intractable, unless P = NP. Yet we propose the first additive approximation algorithm for modularity clustering with a constant factor. Moreover, we provide a rigorous proof that a CS with modularity arbitrary close to maximum modularity QOPT might bear no similarity to the optimal CS of maximum modularity. Thus even when CS with near-optimal modularity are found, other verification methods are needed to confirm the significance of the structure.},

This study examines whether mediated social networks serve the same palliative function. A survey of 401 undergraduate Facebook users revealed that, as predicted, number of Facebook friends associated with stronger perceptions of social support, which in turn associated with reduced stress, and in turn less physical illness and greater well-being. This effect was minimized when interpersonal network size was taken into consideration. However, for those who have experienced many objective life stressors, the number of Facebook friends emerged as the stronger predictor of perceived social support. The "more-friends-the-better" heuristic is proposed as the most likely explanation for these findings.},

abstract = {Submodular functions have become a ubiquitous tool in machine learning. They are learnable from data, and can be optimized efficiently and with guarantees. Nonetheless, recent negative results show that optimizing learned surrogates of submodular functions can result in arbitrarily bad approximations of the true optimum. Our goal in this paper is to highlight the source of this hardness, and propose an alternative criterion for optimizing general combinatorial functions from sampled data. We prove a tight equivalence showing that a class of functions is optimizable if and only if it can be learned. We provide efficient and scalable optimization algorithms for several function classes of interest, and demonstrate their utility on the task of optimally choosing trending social media items.},

Since then, many details of the described vision have become reality: Our mobile phones are powerful multimedia systems, our cars computer systems on wheels, and our homes are turning into smart living environments. All these advances must be turned into products for very cost-sensitive world markets in shorter cycles than ever before. Today, the resulting requirements for design, setup, and operation of our factories become crucial for success. In the past, we often increased the complexity in structures and control systems, resulting in inflexible monolithic production systems. But the future must become "lean"-not only in organization, but also in planning and technology!Wemust develop technologies which allow us to speed up planning and setup, to adapt to rapid product changes during operation, and to reduce the planning effort. To meet these challenges we should also make use of the smart technologies of our daily lives. But for industrial use, there are many open questions to be answered. The existing technologies may be acceptable for consumer use but not yet for industrial applications with high safety and security requirements. Therefore, the SmartFactoryKL initiative was founded by industrial and academic partners to create and operate a demonstration and research test bed for future factory technologies. Many projects develop, test, and evaluate new solutions. This presentation describes changes and challenges, and it summarizes the experience gained to date in the SmartFactoryKL. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Di erent variations of the problem have been studied depending on whether the graph edges are provided in arbitrary order or as incidence lists. However, with a few exceptions, the algorithms have considered insert-only streams. We present a new algorithm estimating the number of triangles in dynamic graph streams where edges can be both inserted and deleted. We show that our algorithm achieves better time and space complexity than previous solutions for various graph classes, for example sparse graphs with a relatively small number of triangles. Also, for graphs with constant transitivity coecient, a common situation in real graphs, this is the rst algorithm achieving constant processing time per edge.},

Both these problems are NP-hard. We prove that (1 2 o(1)) ln n is a threshold below which set cover cannot be approximated efficiently, unless NP has slightly superpolynomial time algorithms.

The algorithm runs in time O ($\alpha$ -2 log (n/$\eta$) (n + m)A), where n, m, refer to the number of nodes, edges in the network.

This means that a set (vertex) can only cover a limited number of its elements (adjacent edges) and the number of available copies of each set (vertex) is bounded. This is a natural generalization of the classical problems that also captures resource limitations in practical scenarios. We obtain the following results. For the unweighted vertex cover problem with hard capacities we give a 3-approximation algorithm which is based on randomized rounding with alterations. We prove that the weighted version is at least as hard as the set cover problem. This is an interesting separation between the approximability of weighted and unweighted versions of a "natural" graph problem. A logarithmic approximation factor for both the set cover and the weighted vertex cover problem with hard capacities follows from the work of Wolsey (1982) on submodular set cover. We provide in this paper a simple and intuitive proof for this bound.},

abstract = {Satisfiability of large random Boolean formulas with K variables per clause (random K-satisfiability) is a fundamental problem in combinatorial discrete optimization. Here we study random K -satisfiability for K = 3, 4 by the Backtracking Survey Propagation (BSP) algorithm, which is able to find, in a time almost linear in the problem size, solutions within a region never reached before: for K = 3 the algorithmic threshold practically coincides with the SAT-UNSAT threshold, while for K=4 it extrapolates beyond the rigidity threshold, where most of the solutions acquire a positive density of frozen variables. All solutions found by BSP have no frozen variables, thus supporting the conjecture that only unfrozen solutions can be found in linear time. The iterative algorithm for determining which variables are frozen in a solution (whitening) reaches the all-variables-unfrozen fixed point following a two step process and has a relaxation time diverging at the algorithmic threshold.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of designing a network of minimum cost while satisfying a prescribed survivability criterion. The survivability criterion requires that a feasible flow must still exists (i.e. all demands can be satisfied without violating arc capacities) even after the disruption of a subset of the network's arcs. Specifically, we consider the case in which a disruption (random or malicious) can destroy a subset of the arcs, with the cost of the disruption not to exceed a disruption budget. This problem takes the form of a tri-level, two-player game, in which the network operator designs (or augments) the network, then the attacker launches a disruption that destroys a subset of arcs, and then the network operator attempts to find a feasible flow over the residual network. We first show how this can be modeled as a two-stage stochastic program from the network operator's perspective, with each of the exponential number of potential attacks considered as a disruption scenario. We then reformulate this problem, via a Benders decomposition, to consider the recourse decisions implicitly, greatly reducing the number of variables but at the expense of an exponential increase in the number of constraints. We next develop a cut-generation based algorithm. Rather than explicitly considering each disruption scenario to identify these Benders cuts, however, we develop a bi-level program and corresponding separation algorithm that enables us to implicitly evaluate the exponential set of disruption scenarios. Our computational results demonstrate the efficacy of this approach.},

Although many researches have been done, the evolving feature of information diffusion hasn't been well treated, including the promising direction of group-level popularity prediction. To this end, we identify the Incremental Group-level Popularity Prediction (IGPP) problem, and propose a novel model IGP-P to address it. We first conduct preprocess on the target topic being predicted, so as to build the initial group-level popularity tensor. Then, we predict the group-level popularity incrementally by exploiting the incremental CP decomposition algorithm. To reduce the cumulative error by incremental prediction, we propose two strategies to restart the CP decomposition. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments in two real datasets. The results show significant improvements of the IGPP method over other works both in the prediction accuracy and the efficiency.

A network reliability concept is embedded into the continuous network design problem in which travelers' route choice behavior follows the stochastic user equilibrium assumption. A new capacity-reliability index is introduced to measure the probability that all of the network links are operated below their capacities when serving different traffic patterns deviating from the average condition. The reliability-based network design problem is formulated as a bi-level program in which the lower level sub-program is the probit-based stochastic user equilibrium problem and the upper level sub-program is the maximization of the new capacity reliability index. The lower level sub-program is solved by a variant of the method of successive averages using the exponential average to represent the learning process of network users on a daily basis that results in the daily variation of traffic-flow pattern, and Monte Carlo stochastic loading. The upper level sub-program is tackled by means of genetic algorithms. A numerical example is used to demonstrate the concept of the proposed framework.},

abstract = {Anyone who has worked with matroids has come away with the conviction that matroids are one of the richest and most useful ideas of our day. —Gian Carlo Rota [10] Why matroids? Have you noticed hidden connections between seemingly unrelated mathematical ideas? Strange that finding roots of polynomials can tell us important things about how to solve certain ordinary differential equations, or that computing a determinant would have anything to do with finding solutions to a linear system of equations. But this is one of the charming features of mathematics—that disparate objects share similar traits. Properties like independence appear in many contexts. Do you find independence everywhere you look? In 1933, three Harvard Junior Fellows unified this recurring theme in mathematics by defining a new mathematical object that they dubbed matroid [4]. Matroids are everywhere, if only we knew how to look. What led those junior-fellows to matroids? The same thing that will lead us: Ma-troids arise from shared behaviors of vector spaces and graphs. We explore this natural motivation for the matroid through two examples and consider how properties of in-dependence surface. We first consider the two matroids arising from these examples, and later introduce three more that are probably less familiar. Delving deeper, we can find matroids in arrangements of hyperplanes, configurations of points, and geometric lattices, if your tastes run in that direction. While tying together similar structures is important and enlightening, matroids do not reside merely in the halls of pure mathematics; they play an essential role in combinatorial optimization, and we consider their role in two contexts, constructing minimum-weight spanning trees and determining optimal schedules. What's that, you say? Minimum-weight what? The mathematical details will be-come clear later, but suppose you move your company into a new office building and your 25 employees need to connect their 25 computers to each other in a network. The cable needed to do this is expensive, so you want to connect them with the least cable possible; this will form a minimum-weight spanning tree, where by weight we mean the length of cable needed to connect the computers, by spanning we mean that we reach each computer, and by tree we mean we have no redundancy in the network. How do we find this minimum length? Test all possible networks for the minimum total cost? That would be 25 23 ≈ 1.4 × 10 32 networks to consider. (There are n n−2 possible trees on n vertices; Bogart [2] gives details.) A computer checking one billion configurations per second would take over a quadrillion years to complete the task. (That's 10 15 years—a very long time.) Matroids provide a more efficient method. VOL. 82, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2009 27 Not only are matroids useful in these optimization settings, it turns out that they are the very characterizations of the problems. Recognizing that a problem involves a matroid tells us whether certain algorithms will return an optimal solution. Knowing that an algorithm effects a solution tells us whether we have a matroid. In the undergraduate curriculum, notions of independence arise in various contexts, yet are often not tied together. Matroids surface naturally in these situations. We pro-vide a brief, accessible introduction so that matroids can be included in undergraduate courses, and so that students (or faculty!) interested in matroids have a place to start. For further study of matroids, please see Oxley's Matroid Theory [9], especially its 61-page chapter, Brief Definitions and Examples. Only a cursory knowledge of linear algebra and graph theory is assumed, so take out your pencil and work along.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study crucial elements of a complex network, namely its nodes and connections, which play a key role in maintaining the network's structure and function under unexpected structural perturbations of nodes and edges removal. Specifically, we want to identify vital nodes and edges whose failure (either random or intentional) will break the most number of connected triples (or triangles) in the network. This problem is extremely important because connected triples form the foundation of strong connections in many real-world systems, such as mutual relationships in social networks, reliable data transmission in communication networks, and stable routing strategies in mobile networks. Disconnected triples, analog to broken mutual connections, can greatly affect the network's structure and disrupt its normal function, which can further lead to the corruption of the entire system. The analysis of such crucial elements will shed light on key factors behind the resilience and robustness of many complex systems in practice. We formulate the analysis under multiple optimization problems and show their intractability. We next propose efficient approximation algorithms, namely DAK-n and DAK-e, which guarantee an {\$}(1-1/e){\$}-approximate ratio (compared to the overall optimal solutions) while having the same time complexity as the best triangle counting and listing algorithm on power-law networks. This advantage makes our algorithms scale extremely well even for very large networks. In an application perspective, we perform comprehensive experiments on real social traces with millions of nodes and billions of edges. These empirical experiments indicate that our approaches achieve comparably better results while are up to 100x faster than current state-of-the-art methods.},

We find that when the highly connected nodes are protected and have lower probability to fail, in contrast to single scale-free (SF) networks where the percolation threshold pc = 0, coupled SF networks are significantly more vulnerable with pc significantly larger than zero. The result implies that interdependent networks are difficult to defend by strategies such as protecting the high degree nodes that have been found useful to significantly improve robustness of single networks.},

However, we show that when the propagation requires simultaneous exposure to multiple sources of activation, called complex propagation, the effect of random links can be just the opposite; it can make the propagation more difficult to achieve. We numerically calculate critical points for a threshold model using several classes of complex networks, including an empirical social network. We also provide an estimation of the critical values in terms of vulnerable nodes. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Cyber-epidemics, the widespread of fake news or propaganda through social media, can cause devastating economic and political consequences. A common countermeasure against cyber-epidemics is to disable a small subset of suspected social connections or accounts to effectively contain the epidemics. An example is the recent shutdown of 125,000 ISIS-related Twitter accounts. Despite many proposed methods to identify such subset, none are scalable enough to provide high-quality solutions in nowadays billion-size networks. To this end, we investigate the Spread Interdiction problems that seek most effective links (or nodes) for removal under the well-known Linear Threshold model. We propose novel CPU-GPU methods that scale to networks with billions of edges, yet, possess rigorous theoretical guarantee on the solution quality. At the core of our methods is an {\$}O(1){\$}-space out-of-core algorithm to generate a new type of random walks, called Hitting Self-avoiding Walks (HSAWs). Such a low memory requirement enables handling of big networks and, more importantly, hiding latency via scheduling of millions of threads on GPUs. Comprehensive experiments on real-world networks show that our algorithms provides much higher quality solutions and are several order of magnitude faster than the state-of-the art. Comparing to the (single-core) CPU counterpart, our GPU implementations achieve significant speedup factors up to 177x on a single GPU and 338x on a GPU pair.},

While there has been immense progress and an impressive arsenal of techniques has been developed, the algorithmic frameworks make idealized assumptions regarding access to the network that can often result in poor performance of state-of-the-art techniques. In this paper we introduce a new framework which we call Adaptive Seeding. The framework is a two-stage stochastic optimization model designed to leverage the potential that typically lies in neighboring nodes of arbitrary samples of social networks. Our main result is an algorithm which provides a constant factor approximation to the optimal adaptive policy for any influence function in the Triggering model.},

Information received via friends tends to be trusted, and online social networks allow individuals to transmit information to many friends at once. By referencing known rumors from Snopes.com, a popular website documenting memes and urban legends, we track the propagation of thousands of rumors appearing on Facebook. From this sample we infer the rates at which rumors from different categories and of varying truth value are uploaded and reshared. We find that rumor cascades run deeper in the social network than reshare cascades in general. We then examine the effect of individual reshares receiving a comment containing a link to a Snopes article on the evolution of the cascade. We find that receiving such a comment increases the likelihood that a reshare of a rumor will be deleted. Furthermore, large cascades are able to accumulate hundreds of Snopes comments while continuing to propagate. Finally, using a dataset of rumors copied and pasted from one status update to another, we show that rumors change over time and that different variants tend to dominate different bursts in popularity.},

Removal of critical nodes decreases or minimizes a system's ability to diffuse entities such as information, goods, or diseases. Previous research suggested some vulnerability metrics, but there remains a lack of understanding how a metric changes (e.g., upper bound and lower bound) and how it is related to the structure of a complex system. This research designs three metrics to assess system vulnerability, and analyzes their characteristics over different system structures. A polynomial-time algorithm using the three metrics is developed to identify critical nodes step by step (local optima). Their performance are examined and compared to other algorithms. The three metrics designed in this article are informative and their characteristics are thoroughly analyzed for various system structures. The metrics and algorithm may be used by domain experts to effectively assess system vulnerability and identify critical nodes.},

We associate combinatorial and algebraic objects, differen- tials and matroids, which are descriptors of the particular reconstruction task, to the set of observed entries, and apply them to obtain reconstruction bounds. We show how similar techniques can be used to obtain reconstruction bounds on general compressed sensing problems with algebraic compression constraints. Using the new theory, we develop several algorithms for low-rank matrix completion, which allow to determine which set of entries can be potentially reconstructed and which not, and how, and we present algorithms which apply algebraic combinatorial methods in order to reconstruct the missing entries.},

Clustering 16S rRNA gene sequences into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) is a common method used in studying microbial communities. We present a new approach to greedy clustering using a trie-like data structure and Four Russians speedup. We evaluate the running time of our method in terms of the number of comparisons it makes during clustering and show in experimental results that the number of comparisons grows linearly with the size of the dataset as opposed to the quadratic running time of other methods. We compare the clusters output by our method to the popular greedy clustering tool UCLUST. We show that the clusters we generate can be both tighter and larger. 1998 ACM Subject Classification B.2.4 Algorithms The problem of comparing a string against a large set of sequences is of central importance in domains such as computational biology, information retrieval, and databases. Solving this problem is a key subroutine in many greedy clustering heuristics, wherein we iteratively choose a cluster center and form a cluster by recruiting all strings which are similar to the center. In computational biology, sequence similarity search is used to group biological sequences that are closely related. We will use this domain as a motivating example throughout the paper. Traditionally, clustering 16S rRNA gene [11] sequences involved building a multiple sequence alignment of all sequences, computing a pairwise distance matrix of sequences based on the multiple sequence alignment, and clustering this matrix [17].

Safety was mixed with gaps in external review approaches (20{\%} used audits and association links) and internal review approaches (70{\%} use moderation). Internal safety review offers limited protection: misinformation about a diabetes 'cure' was found on four moderated sites. Of nine sites with advertising, transparency was missing on five; ads for unfounded 'cures' were present on three. Technological safety was poor with almost no use of procedures for secure data storage and transmission; only three sites support member controls over personal information.

It has also been shown that offering coupons to a small fraction of users (called seed users) may affect the purchase decisions of many other users in a social network. This motivates us to study the optimal coupon allocation problem, and our objective is to allocate coupons to a set of users so as to maximize the expected cascade. Different from existing studies on influence maximizaton (IM), our framework allows a general utility function and a more complex set of constraints. In particular, we formulate our problem as an approximate submodular maximization problem subject to matroid and knapsack constraints. Existing techniques relying on the submodularity of the utility function, such as greedy algorithm, can not work directly on a non-submodular function. We use {\$}\backslashepsilon{\$} to measure the difference between our function and its closest submodular function and propose a novel approximate algorithm with approximation ratio {\$}\backslashbeta(\backslashepsilon){\$} with {\$}\backslashlim{\_}{\{}\backslashepsilon\backslashrightarrow 0{\}}\backslashbeta(\backslashepsilon)=1-1/e{\$}.

The text illustrates the breadth of the modeling and analysis capabilities that are supported by the software and support of complex real-world applications. Pyomo is an open source software package for formulating and solving large-scale optimization and operations research problems. The text begins with a tutorial on simple linear and integer programming models. A detailed reference of Pyomo's modeling components is illustrated with extensive examples, including a discussion of how to load data from data sources like spreadsheets and databases. Chapters describing advanced modeling capabilities for nonlinear and stochastic optimization are also included. The Pyomo software provides familiar modeling features within Python, a powerful dynamic programming language that has a very clear, readable syntax and intuitive object orientation. Pyomo includes Python classes for defining sparse sets, parameters, and variables, which can be used to formulate algebraic expressions that define objectives and constraints. Moreover, Pyomo can be used from a command-line interface and within Python's interactive command environment, which makes it easy to create Pyomo models, apply a variety of optimizers, and examine solutions. The software supports a different modeling approach than commercial AML (Algebraic Modeling Languages) tools, and is designed for flexibility, extensibility, portability, and maintainability but also maintains the central ideas in modern AMLs.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel framework for computing single or multiple atlases (templates) from a large population of images. Unlike many existing methods, our proposed approach is distinguished by its emphasis on the sharpness of the computed atlases and the requirement of rotational invariance. In particular, we argue that sharp atlas images that retain crucial and important anatomical features with high fidelity are more useful for many medical imaging applications when compared with the blurry and fuzzy atlas images computed by most existing methods. The geometric notion that underlies our approach is the idea of manifold learning in a quotient space, the quotient space of the image space by the rotations. We present an extension of the existing manifold learning approach to quotient spaces by using invariant metrics, and utilizing the manifold structure for partitioning the images into more homogeneous sub-collections, each of which can be represented by a single atlas image. Specifically, we propose a three-step algorithm. First, we partition the input images into subgroups using unsupervised or semi-supervised learning methods on manifolds. Then we formulate a convex optimization problem in each subgroup to locate the atlases and determine the crucial neighbors that are used in the realization step to form the template images. We have evaluated our algorithm using whole brain MR volumes from OASIS database. Experimental results demonstrate that the atlases computed using the proposed algorithm not only discover the brain structural changes in different age groups but also preserve important structural details and generally enjoy better image quality.},

abstract = {Results The database search retrieved 4656 citations; 12 studies (7411 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Facebook was the most utilized SNS, followed by health- specific SNSs, and Twitter. Eight randomized controlled trials were combined in a meta-analysis. A positive effect of SNS interventions on health behavior outcomes was found (Hedges' g 0.24; 95{\%} CI 0.04 to 0.43). There was considerable heterogeneity (I2=84.0{\%}; T2=0.058) and no evidence of publication bias. Discussion To the best of our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis evaluating the effectiveness of SNS interventions in changing health-related behaviors. Most studies evaluated multi-component interventions, posing problems in isolating the specific effect of the SNS. Health behavior change theories were seldom mentioned in the included articles, but two particularly innovative studies used ‘network alteration', showing a positive effect. Overall, SNS interventions appeared to be effective in promoting changes in health-related behaviors, and further research regarding the application of these promising tools is warranted. Conclusions Our study showed a positive effect of SNS interventions on health behavior-related outcomes, but there was considerable heterogeneity.},

abstract = { In the future automated battle field communications will be supported in part by a hierarchical wireless network that includes: ad hoc ground radio subnets; point to point wireless long haul backbone, and; unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In such a hierarchical network, nodes are generally partitioned into groups. Each group has one or more backbone nodes that provide access points to the backbone network and to UAVs. Communications between groups can thus utilize links at higher level. A critical protocol in the operation of such a large mobile network is routing. Previous research of UAV based systems has generally assumed the use of a hierarchical routing scheme, for example, extended hierarchical state routing (EHSR). However, a hierarchical scheme like EHSR has some limitations. In this paper, we extend landmark ad hoc routing (LANMAR) to a hierarchical structure with backbone nodes, high quality backbone links and UAVs. We show that the basic LANMAR scheme can be extended to incorporate backbone and UAV links. We will also show how backbone links and UAV links are automatically discovered by the LANMAR routing algorithm and are used effectively to reach remote destinations (thus reducing the hop distance). In other words, our scheme will combine the benefits of "flat" LANMAR routing and physical network hierarchy, without suffering of the intrinsic EHSR limitations.},

abstract = {We analyze the performance of the greedy algorithm, and also a discrete semi-gradient based algorithm, for maximizing the sum of a suBmodular and suPermodular (BP) function (both of which are non-negative monotone non-decreasing) under two types of constraints, either a cardinality constraint or {\$}p\backslashgeq 1{\$} matroid independence constraints. These problems occur naturally in several real-world applications in data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. The problems are ordinarily inapproximable to any factor (as we show). Using the curvature {\$}\backslashkappa{\_}f{\$} of the submodular term, and introducing {\$}\backslashkappa{\^{}}g{\$} for the supermodular term (a natural dual curvature for supermodular functions), however, both of which are computable in linear time, we show that BP maximization can be efficiently approximated by both the greedy and the semi-gradient based algorithm. The algorithms yield multiplicative guarantees of {\$}\backslashfrac{\{}1{\}}{\{}\backslashkappa{\_}f{\}}\backslashleft[1-e{\^{}}{\{}-(1-\backslashkappa{\^{}}g)\backslashkappa{\_}f{\}}\backslashright]{\$} and {\$}\backslashfrac{\{}1-\backslashkappa{\^{}}g{\}}{\{}(1-\backslashkappa{\^{}}g)\backslashkappa{\_}f + p{\}}{\$} for the two types of constraints respectively. For pure monotone supermodular constrained maximization, these yield {\$}1-\backslashkappa{\^{}}g{\$} and {\$}(1-\backslashkappa{\^{}}g)/p{\$} for the two types of constraints respectively. We also analyze the hardness of BP maximization and show that our guarantees match hardness by a constant factor and by {\$}O(\backslashln(p)){\$} respectively. Computational experiments are also provided supporting our analysis.},

abstract = {A long-standing hypothesis at the interface of physics and neuroscience is that neural networks self-organize to the critical point of a phase transition, thereby optimizing aspects of sensory information processing1–3 . This idea is partially supported by strong evidence for critical dynamics observed in the cerebral cortex4–10 , but the impact of sensory input on these dynamics is largely unknown. Thus, the foundations of this hypothesis—the self-organization process and how it manifests during strong sensory input—remain unstudied experimentally. Here we show in visual cortex and in a computational model that strong sensory input initially elicits cortical network dynamics that are not critical, but adaptive changes in the network rapidly tune the system to criticality. This conclusion is based on observations of multifaceted scaling laws predicted to occur at criticality4,11 . Our findings establish sensory adaptation as a self-organizing mechanism that maintains criticality in visual cortex during sensory information processing.},

abstract = {Recent events demonstrated the vulnerability of power grids to cyber attacks and to physical attacks. Therefore, we focus on joint cyber and physical attacks and develop methods to retrieve the grid state information following such an attack. We consider a model in which an adversary attacks a zone by physically disconnecting some of its power lines and blocking the information flow from the zone to the grid's control center. We use tools from linear algebra and graph theory and leverage the properties of the power flow DC approximation to develop methods for information recovery. Using information observed outside the attacked zone, these methods recover information about the disconnected lines and the phase angles at the buses. We identify sufficient conditions on the zone structure and constraints on the attack characteristics such that these methods can recover the information. We also show that it is NP-hard to find an approximate solution to the problem of partitioning the power grid into the minimum number of attack-resilient zones. However, since power grids can often be represented by planar graphs, we develop a constant approximation partitioning algorithm for these graphs. Finally, we numerically study the relationships between the grid's resilience and its structural properties, and demonstrate the partitioning algorithm on real power grids. The results can provide insights into the design of a secure control network for the smart grid.},

A recent study by Onnela et al uncovered the weak ties effects in mobile communication. In this paper, we provide complementary results on document networks, that is, the edges connecting less similar nodes in content are more significant in maintaining the global connectivity. We propose an index called bridgeness to quantify the edge significance in maintaining connectivity, which only depends on local information of the network topology. We compare the bridgeness with content similarity and some other structural indices according to an edge percolation process. Experimental results on document networks show that the bridgeness outperforms content similarity in characterizing the edge significance. Furthermore, extensive numerical results on disparate networks indicate that the bridgeness is also better than some well-known indices on edge significance, including the Jaccard coefficient, degree product and betweenness centrality.},

abstract = {Databases need to allocate and free blocks of storage on disk. Freed blocks introduce holes where no data is stored. Allocation systems attempt to reuse such deallocated regions in order to minimize the footprint on disk. If previously allocated blocks cannot be moved, the problem is called the memory allocation problem, which is known to have a logarithmic overhead in the footprint. This paper defines the storage reallocation problem, where previously allocated blocks can be moved, or reallocated, but at some cost. The algorithms presented here are cost oblivious, in that they work for a broad and reasonable class of cost functions, even when they do not know what the cost function is. The objective is to minimize the storage footprint, that is, the largest memory address containing an allocated object, while simultaneously minimizing the reallocation costs. This paper gives asymptotically optimal algorithms for storage reallocation, in which the storage footprint is at most (1+epsilon) times optimal, and the reallocation cost is at most (1/epsilon) times the original allocation cost, which is also optimal. The algorithms are cost oblivious as long as the allocation/reallocation cost function is subadditive.},

abstract = {Constrained submodular maximization problems have long been studied, with near-optimal results known under a variety of constraints when the submodular function is monotone. The case of non-monotone submodular maximization is less understood: the first approximation algorithms even for the unconstrainted setting were given by Feige et al. (FOCS '07). More recently, Lee et al. (STOC '09, APPROX '09) show how to approximately maximize non-monotone submodular functions when the constraints are given by the intersection of p matroid constraints; their algorithm is based on local-search procedures that consider p-swaps, and hence the running time may be n{\^{}}Omega(p), implying their algorithm is polynomial-time only for constantly many matroids. In this paper, we give algorithms that work for p-independence systems (which generalize constraints given by the intersection of p matroids), where the running time is poly(n,p). Our algorithm essentially reduces the non-monotone maximization problem to multiple runs of the greedy algorithm previously used in the monotone case. Our idea of using existing algorithms for monotone functions to solve the non-monotone case also works for maximizing a submodular function with respect to a knapsack constraint: we get a simple greedy-based constant-factor approximation for this problem. With these simpler algorithms, we are able to adapt our approach to constrained non-monotone submodular maximization to the (online) secretary setting, where elements arrive one at a time in random order, and the algorithm must make irrevocable decisions about whether or not to select each element as it arrives. We give constant approximations in this secretary setting when the algorithm is constrained subject to a uniform matroid or a partition matroid, and give an O(log k) approximation when it is constrained by a general matroid of rank k.},

abstract = {The grammar problem, a generalization of the single-source shortest-path problem introduced by D. E. Knuth (Inform. Process. Lett. 6(1) (1977), 1-5) is to compute the minimum-cost derivation of a terminal string from each nonterminal of a given context-free grammar, with the cost of a derivation being suitably defined. This problem also subsumes the problem of finding optimal hyperpaths in directed hypergraphs (under varying optimization criteria) that has received attention recently. In this paper we present an incremental algorithm for a version of the grammar problem. As a special case of this algorithm we obtain an efficient incremental algorithm for the single-source shortest-path problem with positive edge lengths. The aspect of our work that distinguishes it from other work on the dynamic shortest-path problem is its ability to handle ''multiple heterogeneous modifications'': between updates, the input graph is allowed to be restructured by an arbitrary mixture of edge insertions, edge deletions, and edge-length changes.

abstract = {Society relies heavily on its networked physical infrastructure and information systems. Accurately assessing the vulnerability of these systems against disruptive events is vital for planning and risk management. Existing approaches to vulnerability assessments of large-scale systems mainly focus on investigating inhomogeneous properties of the underlying graph elements. These measures and the associated heuristic solutions are limited in evaluating the vulnerability of large-scale network topologies. Furthermore, these approaches often fail to provide performance guarantees of the proposed solutions. In this paper, we propose a vulnerability measure, pairwise connectivity, and use it to formulate network vulnerability assessment as a graph-theoretical optimization problem, referred to as -disruptor. The objective is to identify the minimum set of critical network elements, namely nodes and edges, whose removal results in a specific degradation of the network global pairwise connectivity. We prove the NP-completeness and inapproximability of this problem and propose an pseudo-approximation algorithm to computing the set of critical nodes and an pseudo-approximation algorithm for computing the set of critical edges. The results of an extensive simulation-based experiment show the feasibility of our proposed vulnerability assessment framework and the efficiency of the proposed approximation algorithms in comparison to other approaches.},

abstract = {We study the power of fractional allocations of resources to maximize influence in a network. This work extends in a natural way the well-studied model by Kempe, Kleinberg, and Tardos (2003), where a designer selects a (small) seed set of nodes in a social network to influence directly, this influence cascades when other nodes reach certain thresholds of neighbor influence, and the goal is to maximize the final number of influenced nodes. Despite extensive study from both practical and theoretical viewpoints, this model limits the designer to a binary choice for each node, with no way to apply intermediate levels of influence. This model captures some settings precisely, e.g. exposure to an idea or pathogen, but it fails to capture very relevant concerns in others, for example, a manufacturer promoting a new product by distributing five "20{\%} off" coupons instead of giving away one free product. While fractional versions of problems tend to be easier to solve than integral versions, for influence maximization, we show that the two versions have essentially the same computational complexity. On the other hand, the two versions can have vastly different solutions: the added flexibility of fractional allocation can lead to significantly improved influence. Our main theoretical contribution is to show how to adapt the major positive results from the integral case to the fractional case. Specifically, Mossel and Roch (2006) used the submodularity of influence to obtain their integral results; we introduce a new notion of continuous submodularity, and use this to obtain matching fractional results. We conclude that we can achieve the same greedy {\$}(1-1/e-\backslashepsilon){\$}-approximation for the fractional case as the integral case. In practice, we find that the fractional model performs substantially better than the integral model, according to simulations on real-world social network data.},

Greedy algorithms are widely used for subset selection, and have shown good approximation performances in deterministic situations. However, their behaviors are stochas-tic in many realistic situations (e.g., large-scale and noisy). For general stochastic greedy algo-rithms, bounded approximation guarantees were obtained only for subset selection with monotone submodular objective functions, while real-world applications often involve non-monotone or non-submodular objective functions and can be subject to a more general constraint than a size constraint. This work proves their approximation guarantees in these cases, and thus largely extends the applicabil-ity of stochastic greedy algorithms.},

Our procedure is based on the classic probabilistic result, the birthday paradox. When the transitivity is constant and there are more edges than wedges (common properties for social networks), we can prove that our algorithm requires {\$}O(\backslashsqrt{\{}n{\}}){\$} space ({\$}n{\$} is the number of vertices) to provide accurate estimates. We run a detailed set of experiments on a variety of real graphs and demonstrate that the memory requirement of the algorithm is a tiny fraction of the graph. For example, even for a graph with 200 million edges, our algorithm stores just 60,000 edges to give accurate results. Being a single pass streaming algorithm, our procedure also maintains a real-time estimate of the transitivity/number of triangles of a graph, by storing a minuscule fraction of edges.},

Recent approaches thus aim at finding a sparser representation of the graph to amplify variations in pairwise distances. Since the effect of sparsification on the layout is difficult to describe analytically, the incorporated filtering parameters of these approaches typically have to be selected manually and individually for each input instance. We here propose the use of graph invariants to determine suitable parameters automatically. This allows us to perform adaptive filtering to obtain drawings in which the cluster structure is most prominent. The approach is based on an empirical relationship between input and output characteristics that is derived from real and synthetic networks. Experimental evaluation shows the effectiveness of our approach and suggests that it can be used by default to increase the robustness of force-directed layout methods.},

abstract = {Networks of living neurons exhibit diverse patterns of activity, including oscillations, synchrony, and waves. Recent work in physics has shown yet another mode of activity in systems composed of many nonlinear units interacting locally. For example, avalanches, earthquakes, and forest fires all propagate in systems organized into a critical state in which event sizes show no characteristic scale and are described by power laws. We hypothesized that a similar mode of activity with complex emergent properties could exist in networks of cortical neurons. We investigated this issue in mature organotypic cultures and acute slices of rat cortex by recording spontaneous local field potentials continuously using a 60 channel multielectrode array. Here, we show that propagation of spontaneous activity in cortical networks is described by equations that govern avalanches. As predicted by theory for a critical branching process, the propagation obeys a power law with an exponent of -3/2 for event sizes, with a branching parameter close to the critical value of 1. Simulations show that a branching parameter at this value optimizes information transmission in feedforward networks, while preventing runaway network excitation. Our findings suggest that "neuronal avalanches" may be a generic property of cortical networks, and represent a mode of activity that differs profoundly from oscillatory, synchronized, or wave-like network states. In the critical state, the network may satisfy the competing demands of information transmission and network stability.},

Equivalently, how to best choose communities in social networks like Facebook to stop rumors from spreading? Immunization is an important problem in multiple different domains like epidemiology, public health, cyber security and social media. Additionally, clearly immunization at group scale (like schools and communities) is more realistic due to constraints in implementations and compliance (e.g., it is hard to ensure specific individuals take the adequate vaccine). Hence efficient algorithms for such a "group-based" problem can help public-health experts take more practical decisions. However most prior work has looked into individual-scale immunization. In this paper, we study the problem of controlling propagation at group scale. We formulate novel so-called Group Immunization problems for multiple natural settings (for both threshold and cascade-based contagion models under both node-level and edge-level interventions) and develop multiple efficient algorithms, including provably approximate solutions. Finally, we show the effectiveness of our methods via extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets.},

abstract = {Information diffusion and virus propagation are fundamental processes taking place in networks. While it is often possible to directly observe when nodes become infected with a virus or adopt the information, observing individual transmissions (i.e., who infects whom, or who influences whom) is typically very difficult. Furthermore, in many applications, the underlying network over which the diffusions and propagations spread is actually unobserved. We tackle these challenges by developing a method for tracing paths of diffusion and influence through networks and inferring the networks over which contagions propagate. Given the times when nodes adopt pieces of information or become infected, we identify the optimal network that best explains the observed infection times. Since the optimization problem is NP-hard to solve exactly, we develop an efficient approximation algorithm that scales to large datasets and finds provably near-optimal networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by tracing information diffusion in a set of 170 million blogs and news articles over a one year period to infer how information flows through the online media space. We find that the diffusion network of news for the top 1,000 media sites and blogs tends to have a core-periphery structure with a small set of core media sites that diffuse information to the rest of the Web. These sites tend to have stable circles of influence with more general news media sites acting as connectors between them.},

abstract = {Node centrality measures are important in a large number of graph applications, from search and ranking to social and biological network analysis. In this paper we study node centrality for very large graphs, up to billions of nodes and edges. Various definitions for centrality have been proposed, ranging from very simple (e.g., node degree) to more elab- orate. However, measuring centrality in billion-scale graphs poses several challenges. Many of the traditional defini- tions such as closeness and betweenness were not designed with scalability in mind. Therefore, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to compute them both accurately and effi- ciently. In this paper, we propose centrality measures suit- able for very large graphs, as well as scalable methods to effectively compute them. More specifically, we propose effective closeness and LINERANK which are designed for billion-scale graphs. We also develop algorithms to compute the proposed centrality measures in MAPREDUCE, a mod- ern paradigm for large-scale, distributed data processing. We present extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets, which demonstrate the scalability of our ap- proach to very large graphs, as well as interesting findings and anomalies.},

Betweenness is, in some sense, a measure of the influence a node has over the spread of information through the network. By counting only shortest paths, however, the conventional definition implicitly assumes that information spreads only along those shortest paths. Here, we propose a betweenness measure that relaxes this assumption, including contributions from essentially all paths between nodes, not just the shortest, although it still gives more weight to short paths. The measure is based on random walks, counting how often a node is traversed by a random walk between two other nodes. We show how our measure can be calculated using matrix methods, and give some examples of its application to particular networks.},

abstract = {In recent years, researchers have investigated a growing number of weighted networks where ties are differentiated according to their strength or capacity. Yet, most network measures do not take weights into consideration, and thus do not fully capture the richness of the information contained in the data. In this paper, we focus on a measure originally defined for unweighted networks: the global clustering coefficient. We propose a generalization of this coefficient that retains the information encoded in the weights of ties. We then undertake a comparative assessment by applying the standard and generalized coefficients to a number of network datasets. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

But, to our knowledge, no natural problem is known to be PTAS-complete and no problem at all is known to be Poly-APX-complete. On the other hand, DPTAS- and Poly-DAPX-completeness have not been studied until now. We first prove in this paper the existence of natural Poly-APX- and Poly-DAPX-complete problems under the well known PTAS-reduction and under the DPTAS-reduction (defined in "G. Ausiello, C. Bazgan, M. Demange, and V. Th. Paschos, Completeness in differential approximation classes, MFCS'03"), respectively. Next, we deal with PTAS- and DPTAS-completeness. We introduce approximation preserving reductions, called FT and DFT, respectively, and prove that, under these new reductions, natural problems are PTAS-complete, or DPTAS-complete. Then, we deal with the existence of intermediate problems under our reductions and we partially answer this question showing that the existence of NPO-intermediate problems under Turing-reductions is a sufficient condition for the existence of intermediate problems under both FT- and DFT-reductions. Finally, we show that MIN COLORING is DAPX-complete under DPTAS-reductions. This is the first DAPX-complete problem that is not simultaneously APX-complete. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Predicting protein complexes from protein-protein interaction data is becoming a fundamental problem in computational biology. The identification and characterization of protein complexes implicated are crucial to the understanding of the molecular events under normal and abnormal physiological conditions. On the other hand, large datasets of experimentally detected protein-protein interactions were determined using High-throughput experimental techniques. However, experimental data is usually liable to contain a large number of spurious interactions. Therefore, it is essential to validate these interactions before exploiting them to predict protein complexes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In this paper, we propose a novel graph mining algorithm (PEWCC) to identify such protein complexes. Firstly, the algorithm assesses the reliability of the interaction data, then predicts protein complexes based on the concept of weighted clustering coefficient. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the performance of PEWCC was compared to several methods. PEWCC was able to detect more matched complexes than any of the state-of-the-art methods with higher quality scores.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The higher accuracy achieved by PEWCC in detecting protein complexes is a valid argument in favor of the proposed method.

For example, why does a deep neural network assign an image to a particular class? We cast interpretability of black-box classifiers as a combinatorial maximization problem and propose an efficient streaming algorithm to solve it subject to cardinality constraints. By extending ideas from Badanidiyuru et al. [2014], we provide a constant factor approximation guarantee for our algorithm in the case of random stream order and a weakly submodular objective function. This is the first such theoretical guarantee for this general class of functions, and we also show that no such algorithm exists for a worst case stream order.

abstract = {Recovering a large matrix from a small subset of its entries is a challenging problem arising in many real applications, such as image inpainting and recommender systems. Many existing approaches formulate this problem as a general low-rank matrix approximation problem. Since the rank operator is nonconvex and discontinuous, most of the recent theoretical studies use the nuclear norm as a convex relaxation. One major limitation of the existing approaches based on nuclear norm minimization is that all the singular values are simultaneously minimized, and thus the rank may not be well approximated in practice. In this paper, we propose to achieve a better approximation to the rank of matrix by truncated nuclear norm, which is given by the nuclear norm subtracted by the sum of the largest few singular values. In addition, we develop a novel matrix completion algorithm by minimizing the Truncated Nuclear Norm. We further develop three efficient iterative procedures, TNNR-ADMM, TNNR-APGL, and TNNR-ADMMAP, to solve the optimization problem. TNNR-ADMM utilizes the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), while TNNR-AGPL applies the accelerated proximal gradient line search method (APGL) for the final optimization. For TNNR-ADMMAP, we make use of an adaptive penalty according to a novel update rule for ADMM to achieve a faster convergence rate. Our empirical study shows encouraging results of the proposed algorithms in comparison to the state-of-the-art matrix completion algorithms on both synthetic and real visual datasets.},

abstract = {Information diffusion in online social networks is affected by the underlying network topology, but it also has the power to change it. Online users are constantly creating new links when exposed to new information sources, and in turn these links are alternating the way information spreads. However, these two highly intertwined stochastic processes, information diffusion and network evolution, have been predominantly studied separately, ignoring their co-evolutionary dynamics. We propose a temporal point process model, COEVOLVE, for such joint dynamics, allowing the intensity of one process to be modulated by that of the other. This model allows us to efficiently simulate interleaved diffusion and network events, and generate traces obeying common diffusion and network patterns observed in real-world networks. Furthermore, we also develop a convex optimization framework to learn the parameters of the model from historical diffusion and network evolution traces. We experimented with both synthetic data and data gathered from Twitter, and show that our model provides a good fit to the data as well as more accurate predictions than alternatives.},

To understand why, it helps to examine the main components of the FM-index in more detail, which is a rank data structure over the Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) of the string that will allow us to find the interval in the string's suffix array (SA) containing pointers to starting positions of occurrences of a given pattern; second, a sample of the SA that $\backslash$---| when used with the rank data structure $\backslash$---| allows us access the SA. The rank data structure can be kept small even for large genomic databases, by run-length compressing the BWT, but until recently there was no means known to keep the SA sample small without greatly slowing down access to the SA. Now that Gagie et al. (SODA 2018) have defined an SA sample that takes about the same space as the run-length compressed BWT $\backslash$---| we have the design for efficient FM-indexes of genomic databases but are faced with the problem of building them. In 2018 we showed how to build the BWT of large genomic databases efficiently (WABI 2018) but the problem of building Gagie et al.'s SA sample efficiently was left open. We compare our approach to state-of-the-art methods for constructing the SA sample, and demonstrate that it is the fastest and most space-efficient method on highly repetitive genomic databases. Lastly, we apply our method for indexing partial and whole human genomes, and show that it improves over Bowtie with respect to both memory and time.},

In this paper, we first provide a survey of quantitative models of terrorist groups. To date, however, the best-known quantitative models of terror group behavior are based on various types of quantitative logic programs. After our survey, we address an important question posed to us by Nobel laureate, Tom Schelling. Once a set of quantitative logic behavior rules about an adversary has been learned, should these rules be disclosed or not? We develop a game theoretic framework in order to answer this question with a defender who has to decide what rules to release publicly and which ones to keep hidden. We first study the attacker's optimal attack strategy, given a set of disclosed rules, and then we study the problem of which rules to disclose so that the attacker's optimal strategy has minimal effectiveness. We study the complexity of both problems, present algorithms to solve both, and then present a (1-1/e )-approximation algorithm that (under some restrictions) uses a submodularity property to compute the optimal defender strategy. Finally, we provide experimental results showing that our framework works well in practice-these results are also shown to be statistically significant.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several disease-specific information exchanges now exist on Facebook and other online social networking sites. These new sources of knowledge, support, and engagement have become important for patients living with chronic disease, yet the quality and content of the information provided in these digital arenas are poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: To qualitatively evaluate the content of communication in Facebook communities dedicated to diabetes. DESIGN: We identified the 15 largest Facebook groups focused on diabetes management. For each group, we downloaded the 15 most recent "wall posts" and the 15 most recent discussion topics from the 10 largest groups. PATIENTS: Four hundred eighty unique users were identified in a series of 690 comments from wall posts and discussion topics. MAIN MEASURES: Posts were abstracted and aggregated into a database. Two investigators evaluated the posts, developed a thematic coding scheme, and applied codes to the data. KEY RESULTS: Patients with diabetes, family members, and their friends use Facebook to share personal clinical information, to request disease-specific guidance and feedback, and to receive emotional support. Approximately two-thirds of posts included unsolicited sharing of diabetes management strategies, over 13{\%} of posts provided specific feedback to information requested by other users, and almost 29{\%} of posts featured an effort by the poster to provide emotional support to others as members of a community. Approximately 27{\%} of posts featured some type of promotional activity, generally presented as testimonials advertising non-FDA approved, "natural" products. Clinically inaccurate recommendations were infrequent, but were usually associated with promotion of a specific product or service. Thirteen percent of posts contained requests for personal information from Facebook participants. CONCLUSIONS: Facebook provides a forum for reporting personal experiences, asking questions, and receiving direct feedback for people living with diabetes. However, promotional activity and personal data collection are also common, with no accountability or checks for authenticity.},

Existing approaches learn the diffusion models from events in social networks. However, events in social networks may have different underlying reasons. Some of them may be caused by the social influence inside the network, while others may reflect external trends in the ``real world''. Most existing work on the learning of diffusion models does not distinguish the events caused by the social influence from those caused by external trends.  In this paper, we extract social events from data streams in social networks, and then use the extracted social events to improve the learning of information diffusion models. We propose a LADP (Latent Action Diffusion Path) model to incorporate the information diffusion model with the model of external trends, and then design an EM-based algorithm to infer the diffusion probabilities, the external trends and the sources of events efficiently.},

abstract = {This thesis is concerned with the Distributed Information Gathering (DIG) problem in which a Sensor Network is tasked with building a common representation of environment. The problem is motivated by the advantages offered by distributed autonomous sensing systems and the challenges they present. The focus of this study is on Macro Sensor Networks, characterized by platform mobility, heterogeneous teams, and long mission duration. The system under consideration may consist of an arbitrary number of mobile autonomous robots, stationary sensor platforms, and human operators, all linked in a network. This work describes a comprehensive framework called Active Sensor Network (ASN) which addresses the tasks of information fusion, decision making, system configuration, and user interaction. The main design objectives are scalability with the number of robotic platforms, maximum flexibility in implementation and deployment, and robustness to component and communication failure. The framework is described from three complementary points of view: architecture, algorithms, and implementation. The main contribution of this thesis is the development of the ASN architecture. Its design follows three guiding principles: decentralization, modularity, and locality of interactions. These principles are applied to all aspects of the architecture and the framework in general. To achieve flexibility, the design approach emphasizes interactions between components rather than the definition of the components themselves. The architecture specifies a small set of interfaces sufficient to implement a wide range of information gathering systems. In the area of algorithms, this thesis builds on the earlier work on Decentralized Data Fusion (DDF) and its extension to information-theoretic decision making. It presents the Bayesian Decentralized Data Fusion (BDDF) algorithm formulated for environment features represented by a general probability density function. Several specific representations are also considered: Gaussian, discrete, and the Certainty Grid map. Well known algorithms for these representations are shown to implement various aspects of the Bayesian framework. As part of the ASN implementation, a practical indoor sensor network has been developed and tested. Two series of experiments were conducted, utilizing two types of environment representation: 1) point features with Gaussian position uncertainty and 2) Certainty Grid maps. The network was operational for several days at a time, with individual platforms coming on and off-line. On several occasions, the network consisted of 39 software com- ponents. The lessons learned during the systems development may be applicable to other heterogeneous distributed systems with data-intensive algorithms.},

In this paper, assuming that the maximum covering requirement {\$}r{\_}{\{}\backslashmax{\}}=\backslashmax{\_}e r{\_}e{\$} is a constant and the cost function is nonnegative, monotone nondecreasing, and submodular, we give the first randomized bicriteria algorithm for SCPMC the output of which fully covers at least {\$}(q-\backslashvarepsilon){\$}-percentage of all elements and the performance ratio is {\$}O(b/\backslashvarepsilon){\$} with a high probability, where {\$}b=\backslashmax{\_}e\backslashbinom{\{}f{\}}{\{}r{\_}{\{}e{\}}{\}}{\$} and {\$}f{\$} is the maximum number of sets containing a common element. The algorithm is based on a novel non-linear program. Furthermore, in the case when the covering requirement {\$}r\backslashequiv 1{\$}, a bicriteria {\$}O(f/\backslashvarepsilon){\$}-approximation can be achieved even when monotonicity requirement is dropped off from the cost function.},

abstract = {Networks of coupled dynamical systems have been used to model biological oscillators(1-4), Josephson junction arrays(5,6), excitable media(7), neural networks(8-10), spatial games(11), genetic control networks(12) and many other self-organizing systems. Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon(13,14) (popularly known as six degrees of separation(15)). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},

The data track Twitter activity around the protests that took place in May 2011, which led to the formation of camp sites in dozens of cities all over the country and massive daily demonstrations during the week prior to the elections of May 22. We reconstruct the network of tens of thousands of users and monitor their message activity for a month (April 25, 2011, to May 25, 2011). Using both the structure of the network and levels of activity in message exchange, we identify four types of users and analyze their role in the growth of the protest. Drawing from theories of online activism and research on information diffusion in networks, this article centers on the following two questions: How does protest information spread in online networks? And how do different actors contribute to the growth of activity? The article aims to inform the theoretical debate on whether digital technologies are changing the logic of collective action and to provide evidence of how new media facilitates the emergence of massive offline mobilizations.},

abstract = {We consider power line outages in the transmission system of the power grid, and specifically those caused by a natural disaster or a large scale physical attack. In the transmission system, an outage of a line may lead to overload on other lines, thereby eventually leading to their outage. While such cascading failures have been studied before, our focus is on cascading failures that follow an outage of several lines in the same geographical area. We provide an analytical model of such failures, investigate the model's properties, and show that it differs from other models used to analyze cascades in the power grid (e.g., epidemic/percolation-based models). We then show how to identify the most vulnerable locations in the grid and perform extensive numerical experiments with real grid data to investigate the various effects of geographically correlated outages and the resulting cascades. These results allow us to gain insights into the relationships between various parameters and performance metrics, such as the size of the original event, the final number of connected components, and the fraction of demand (load) satisfied after the cascade. In particular, we focus on the timing and nature of optimal control actions used to reduce the impact of a cascade, in real time. We also compare results obtained by our model to the results of a real cascade that occurred during a major blackout in the San Diego area on Sept. 2011. The analysis and results presented in this paper will have implications both on the design of new power grids and on identifying the locations for shielding, strengthening, and monitoring efforts in grid upgrades.},

This property has been studied extensively, but most of this research has been limited to clustering in single networks. The effect of clustering on the robustness of coupled networks, on the other hand, has received much less attention. Only the case of a pair of fully coupled networks with clustering has recently received study. Here we generalize the study of clustering of a fully coupled pair of networks and apply it to a partially interdependent network of networks with clustering within the network components. We show, both analytically and numerically, how clustering within networks affects the percolation properties of interdependent networks, including the percolation threshold, the size of the giant component, and the critical coupling point at which the firstorder phase transition changes to a secondorder phase transition as the coupling between the networks is reduced. We study two types of clustering, one proposed by Newman [Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 058701 (2009)] in which the average degree is kept constant while the clustering is changed, and the other by Hackett et al. [Phys. Rev.

abstract = {Betweenness centrality is generally regarded as a measure of others' dependence on a given node, and therefore as a measure of potential control. Closeness centrality is usually interpreted either as a measure of access efficiency or of independence from potential control by intermediaries. Betweenness and closeness are commonly assumed to be related for two reasons: first, because of their conceptual duality with respect to dependency, and second, because both are defined in terms of shortest paths. We show that the first of these ideas - the duality - is not only true in a general conceptual sense but also in precise mathematical terms. This becomes apparent when the two indices are expressed in terms of a shared dyadic dependency relation. We also show that the second idea - the shortest paths - is false because it is not preserved when the indices are generalized using the standard definition of shortest paths in valued graphs. This unveils that closeness-as-independence is in fact different from closeness-as-efficiency, and we propose a variant notion of distance that maintains the duality of closeness-as-independence with betweenness also on valued relations.},

abstract = {Existing dictionary learning algorithms are based on the assumption that the data are vectors in an Euclidean vector space ℝ (d) , and the dictionary is learned from the training data using the vector space structure of ℝ (d) and its Euclidean L (2)-metric. However, in many applications, features and data often originated from a Riemannian manifold that does not support a global linear (vector space) structure. Furthermore, the extrinsic viewpoint of existing dictionary learning algorithms becomes inappropriate for modeling and incorporating the intrinsic geometry of the manifold that is potentially important and critical to the application. This paper proposes a novel framework for sparse coding and dictionary learning for data on a Riemannian manifold, and it shows that the existing sparse coding and dictionary learning methods can be considered as special (Euclidean) cases of the more general framework proposed here. We show that both the dictionary and sparse coding can be effectively computed for several important classes of Riemannian manifolds, and we validate the proposed method using two well-known classification problems in computer vision and medical imaging analysis.},

abstract = {The famous Burrows–Wheeler Transform (BWT) was originally defined for a single string but variations have been developed for sets of strings, labeled trees, de Bruijn graphs, etc. In this paper we propose a framework that includes many of these variations and that we hope will simplify the search for more. We first define Wheeler graphs and show they have a property we call path coherence. We show that if the state diagram of a finite-state automaton is a Wheeler graph then, by its path coherence, we can order the nodes such that, for any string, the nodes reachable from the initial state or states by processing that string are consecutive. This means that even if the automaton is non-deterministic, we can still store it compactly and process strings with it quickly. We then rederive several variations of the BWT by designing straightforward finite-state automata for the relevant problems and showing that their state diagrams are Wheeler graphs.},

Recently, triangle counting has also become a widely used tool in network analysis.

The main intention of this work is to evaluate the practicability of triangle counting and listing in very large graphs with various degree distributions.

abstract = {We consider two variants of a probabilistic set covering (PSC) problem. The first variant assumes that there is uncertainty regarding whether a selected set can cover an item, and the objective is to determine a minimum-cost combination of sets so that each item is covered with a prespecified probability. The second variant seeks to maximize the minimum probability that a selected set can cover all items. To date, literature on this problem has focused on the special case in which uncertainties are independent. In this paper, we formulate deterministic mixed-integer programming models for distributionally robust PSC problems with correlated uncertainties. By exploiting the supermodularity of certain substructures and analyzing their polyhedral properties, we develop strong valid inequalities to strengthen the formulations. Computational results illustrate that our modeling approach can outperform formulations in which correlations are ignored and that our algorithms can significantly reduce overall computation time.

abstract = {This paper demonstrates a cluster-based method to isolate influence in social network-based observational data, where "influence" is defined to mean that one person posts about a topic online and a second person posts about the same topic because he or she read the first post. Isolating influence in observational data is difficult, because we may observe that con-nected people discuss the same topic in proximate periods for reasons other than influence, in-cluding homophily–connected people are similar–and exogenous shock; they may have learned of the topic from some external source. We employ a matched sample estimation technique that has been used in the past to measure influence by controlling for demographic and usage based homophily, and add to the matching scheme a cluster ID. Our contribution is two-fold: First, we provide preliminary evidence that social network-based clusters capture homophily, indicating that a network-based attribute approach may not only capture homophily but also may be used in lieu of using demographic attributes for matching similar users in scenarios when privacy preservation is a concern. Second, we show that by adding a network position attribute, a cluster ID, when matching similar users, we can isolate influence better. We be-lieve that our approach to isolate influence can have a broad impact on problems where social networks and associated behaviors can be observed over time.},

Quantifying the causal effect of these mediums on the dis- semination of information requires not only identification of who influences whom, but also of whether individuals would still propagate information in the absence of social sig- nals about that information. We examine the role of social networks in online information diffusion with a large-scale field experiment that randomizes exposure to signals about friends' information sharing among 253 million subjects in situ. Those who are exposed are significantly more likely to spread information, and do so sooner than those who are not exposed. We further examine the relative role of strong and weak ties in information propagation. We show that, although stronger ties are individually more influential, it is the more abundant weak ties who are responsible for the propagation of novel information. This suggests that weak ties may play a more dominant role in the dissemination of information online than currently believed. Categories},

Our solution builds on the factorization performed by SAIS during suffix sorting. We construct a context-free grammar on the input string which can be further reduced into a shorter string by substituting each substring by its corresponding factor. The resulting grammar is encoded by exploring some redundancies, such as common prefixes between suffix rules, which are sorted according to SAIS framework. When compared to well-known compression tools such as RePair and 7-zip under repetitive sequences, our algorithm is faster at compressing and achieves compression ratio close to that of RePair , at the cost of being the slowest at decompressing.},

abstract = {We design two compressed data structures for the full-text indexing problem that support efficient substring searches using roughly the space required for storing the text in compressed form. Our first compressed data structure retrieves the occ occurrences of a pattern P[1, p] within a text T [1, n] in O(p + occ log 1+ n) time for any chosen , 0 {\textless} {\textless} {\textless} 1. This data structure uses at most 5n H k (T) + o(n) bits of storage, where H k (T) is the kth order empirical entropy of T . The space usage is (n) bits in the worst case and o(n) bits for compressible texts. This data structure exploits the relationship between suffix arrays and the Burrows–Wheeler Transform, and can be regarded as a compressed suffix array. Our second compressed data structure achieves O(p + occ) query time using O(n H k (T) log n) + o(n) bits of storage for any chosen , 0 {\textless} {\textless} {\textless} 1. Therefore, it provides optimal output-sensitive query time using o(n log n) bits in the worst case.

Assessing and enhancing cyber-physical system security is therefore of utmost importance for the future electricity grid.

In evading detection by commonly employed residue-based bad data detection tests, FDIAs are capable of severely threatening power system security. Since the first published research on FDIAs in 2009, research into FDIA-based cyber-attacks has been extensive. This paper gives a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art in FDIAs against modern power systems. The paper first summarizes the theoretical basis of FDIAs, and then discusses both the physical and economic impacts of a successful FDIA.

Due to their importance, viral marketing related problems in OSNs have been extensively studied in the past decade. However, none of the existing works can cope with the situation that the propagation rate dynamically increases for popular topics, as they all assume known propagation rates. In this paper, to better describe realistic information propagation in OSNs, we propose a novel model, Dynamic Influence Propagation (DIP), that allows propagation rate to change during the diffusion. We then define a new research problem: Threshold Activation Problem under DIP (TAP-DIP) to study the impact of DIP. TAP-DIP adds extra complexity on the already {\#}P-hard TAP problem. Despite it hardness, we are able to approximate TAP-DIP with O(log|V|) ratio. Sitting in the core of our algorithm are the Lipschitz optimization technique and a novel solution to the general version of TAP, the Multi-TAP problem. Using various real OSN datasets, we experimentally demonstrate the impact of DIP and that our solution not only generates high-quality seed sets when being aware of the rate increase, but also is scalable.},

abstract = {Network representations are useful for describing the structure of a large variety of complex systems. Although most studies of real-world networks suppose that nodes are connected by only a single type of edge, most natural and engineered systems include multiple subsystems and layers of connectivity. This new paradigm has attracted a great deal of attention and one fundamental challenge is to characterize multilayer networks both structurally and dynamically. One way to address this question is to study the spectral properties of such networks. Here, we apply the framework of graph quotients, which occurs naturally in this context, and the associated eigenvalue interlacing results, to the adjacency and Laplacian matrices of undirected multilayer networks. Specifically, we describe relationships between the eigenvalue spectra of multilayer networks and their two most natural quotients, the network of layers and the aggregate network, and show the dynamical implications of working with either of the two simplified representations. Our work thus contributes in particular to the study of dynamical processes whose critical properties are determined by the spectral properties of the underlying network.},

abstract = {Social networks often serve as a medium for the diffusion of ideas or innovations. An individual's decision whether to adopt a product or innovation will be highly dependent on the choices made by the individual's peers or neighbors in the social network. In this work, we study the game of innovation diffusion with multiple competing innovations such as when multiple companies market competing products using viral marketing. Our first contribution is a natural and mathematically tractable model for the diffusion of multiple innovations in a network. We give a (1 − 1/e) approximation algorithm for computing the best response to an opponent's strategy, and prove that the “price of competition” of this game is at most 2. We also discuss “first mover” strategies which try to maximize the expected diffusion against perfect competition. Finally, we give an FPTAS for the problem of maximizing the influence of a single player when the underlying graph is a tree.},

abstract = {We study the problem of maximizing a monotone set function subject to a cardinality constraint {\$}k{\$} in the setting where some number of elements {\$}\backslashtau{\$} is deleted from the returned set. The focus of this work is on the worst-case adversarial setting. While there exist constant-factor guarantees when the function is submodular, there are no guarantees for non-submodular objectives. In this work, we present a new algorithm Oblivious-Greedy and prove the first constant-factor approximation guarantees for a wider class of non-submodular objectives. The obtained theoretical bounds are the first constant-factor bounds that also hold in the linear regime, i.e. when the number of deletions {\$}\backslashtau{\$} is linear in {\$}k{\$}. Our bounds depend on established parameters such as the submodularity ratio and some novel ones such as the inverse curvature. We bound these parameters for two important objectives including support selection and variance reduction. Finally, we numerically demonstrate the robust performance of Oblivious-Greedy for these two objectives on various datasets.},

Further, clustered networks can amplify small homophilic bias for trait assortativity. This marked asymmetry suggests that transitivity, rather than homophily, drives the standard nonsocial/social network dichotomy.},

@article{Gao2010,
abstract = {With the wide applications of large scale graph data such as social networks, the problem of finding the top-k shortest paths attracts increasing attention. This paper focuses on the discovery of the top-k simple shortest paths (paths without loops). The well known algorithm for this problem is due to Yen, and the provided worst-case bound O(kn(m + nlogn)), which comes from O(n) times single-source shortest path discovery for each of k shortest paths, remains unbeaten for 30 years, where n is the number of nodes and m is the number of edges. In this paper, we observe that there are shared sub-paths among O(kn) single-source shortest paths. The basic idea behind our method is to pre-compute the shortest paths to the target node, and utilize them to reduce the discovery cost at running time. Specifically, we transform the original graph by encoding the pre-computed paths, and prove that the shortest path discovered over the transformed graph is equivalent to that in the original graph. Most importantly, the path discovery over the transformed graph can be terminated much earlier than before. In addition, two optimization strategies are presented. One is to reduce the total iteration times for shortest path discovery, and the other is to prune the search space in each iteration with an adaptively-determined threshold. Although the worst-case complexity cannot be lowered, our method is proven to be much more efficient in a general case. The final extensive experimental results (on both real and synthetic graphs) also show that our method offers a significant performance improvement over the existing ones. {\textcopyright} 2010 ACM.},

abstract = {The rapid growth of online social networks is important for viral marketing. Influence maximization refers to the process of finding influential users who make the most of information or product adoption. An independent cascade-based model for influence maximization, called IMIC-OC, was proposed to calculate positive influence. We assumed that influential users spread positive opinions. At the beginning, users held positive or negative opinions as their initial opinions. When more users became involved in the discussions, users balanced their own opinions and those of their neighbors. The number of users who did not change positive opinions was used to determine positive influence. Corresponding influential users who had maximum positive influence were then obtained. Experiments were conducted on three real networks, namely, Facebook, HEP-PH and Epinions, to calculate maximum positive influence based on the IMIC-OC model and two other baseline methods. The proposed model resulted in larger positive influence, thus indicating better performance compared with the baseline methods.},

abstract = {—This paper investigates the network completion problem, where it is assumed that only a small sample of a network (e.g., a complete or partially observed subgraph of a social graph) is observed and we would like to infer the unobserved part of the network. In this paper, we assume that besides the observed subgraph, side information about the nodes such as the pairwise similarity between them is also provided. In contrast to the original network completion problem where the standard methods such as matrix completion is inapplicable due the non-uniform sampling of observed links, we show that by effectively exploiting the side information, it is possible to accurately predict the unobserved links. In contrast to existing matrix completion methods with side information such as shared subsapce learning and matrix completion with transduction, the proposed algorithm decouples the completion from transduction to effectively exploit the similarity information. This crucial difference greatly boosts the performance when appropriate similarity information is used. The recovery error of the proposed algorithm is theoretically analyzed based on the richness of the similarity information and the size of the observed submatrix. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm that addresses the network completion with similarity of nodes with provable guarantees. Experiments on synthetic and real networks from Facebook and Google+ show that the proposed two-stage method is able to accurately reconstruct the network and outperforms other methods.},

We prove that the problem is NP-hard, even in simple networks like complete graphs and trees. We also derive a series of positive results. We present exact pseudo-polynomial time algorithms for general trees, that become polynomial time in case the trees are unweighted. This last result improves on previously published results.

Following the same philosophy as in the configuration model, the degree distribution and the clustering coefficient for each class of nodes of degree k are fixed ad hoc and a priori. The algorithm generates corresponding topologies by applying first a closure of triangles and second the classical closure of remaining free stubs. The procedure unveils an universal relation among clustering and degree-degree correlations for all networks, where the level of assortativity establishes an upper limit to the level of clustering. Maximum assortativity ensures no restriction on the decay of the clustering coefficient whereas disassortativity sets a stronger constraint on its behavior. Correlation measures in real networks are seen to observe this structural bound.},

abstract = {Stochastic Boolean Function Evaluation is the problem of determining the value of a given Boolean function f on an unknown input x, when each bit of x{\_}i of x can only be determined by paying an associated cost c{\_}i. The assumption is that x is drawn from a given product distribution, and the goal is to minimize the expected cost. This problem has been studied in Operations Research, where it is known as "sequential testing" of Boolean functions. It has also been studied in learning theory in the context of learning with attribute costs. We consider the general problem of developing approximation algorithms for Stochastic Boolean Function Evaluation. We give a 3-approximation algorithm for evaluating Boolean linear threshold formulas. We also present an approximation algorithm for evaluating CDNF formulas (and decision trees) achieving a factor of O(log kd), where k is the number of terms in the DNF formula, and d is the number of clauses in the CNF formula. In addition, we present approximation algorithms for simultaneous evaluation of linear threshold functions, and for ranking of linear functions. Our function evaluation algorithms are based on reductions to the Stochastic Submodular Set Cover (SSSC) problem. This problem was introduced by Golovin and Krause. They presented an approximation algorithm for the problem, called Adaptive Greedy. Our main technical contribution is a new approximation algorithm for the SSSC problem, which we call Adaptive Dual Greedy. It is an extension of the Dual Greedy algorithm for Submodular Set Cover due to Fujito, which is a generalization of Hochbaum's algorithm for the classical Set Cover Problem. We also give a new bound on the approximation achieved by the Adaptive Greedy algorithm of Golovin and Krause.},

abstract = {We study the problem of interdicting the arcs in a network in order to maximize the shortest s–t path length. “Interdiction” is an attack on an arc that destroys the arc or increases its effective length; there is a limited interdiction budget. We formulate this bilevel, max–min problem as a mixed-integer program (MIP), which can be solved directly, but we develop more efficient decomposition algorithms. One algorithm enhances Benders decomposition by adding generalized integer cutting planes, called “supervalid inequalities” (SVIs), to the master problem. A second algorithm exploits a unique set-covering master problem. Computational results demonstrate orders-of-magnitude improvements of the decomposition algorithms over direct solution of the MIP and show that SVIs also help solve the original MIP faster.},

abstract = {A fundamental problem in quality-of-service (QoS) routing is to find a path between a source-destination node pair that satisfies two or more end-to-end QoS constraints. We model this problem using a graph with n vertices and m edges with K additive QoS parameters associated with each edge, for any constant Kges2. This problem is known to be NP-hard. Fully polynomial time approximation schemes (FPTAS) for the case of K=2 have been reported in the literature. We concentrate on the general case and make the following contributions. 1) We present a very simple (Km+nlogn) time K-approximation algorithm that can be used in hop-by-hop routing protocols. 2) We present an FPTAS for one optimization version of the QoS routing problem with a time complexity of O(m(n/epsi){\textless}sup{\textgreater}K-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}). 3) We present an FPTAS for another optimization version of the QoS routing problem with a time complexity of O(nlogn+m(H/epsi){\textless}sup{\textgreater}K-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) when there exists an H-hop path satisfying all QoS constraints. When K is reduced to 2, our results compare favorably with existing algorithms. The results of this paper hold for both directed and undirected graphs.

abstract = {Eliminating interactions among individuals is an important means of blocking contagion spread, e.g., closing schools during an epidemic or shutting down electronic communication channels during social unrest. We study contagion blocking in networked populations by identifying edges to remove from a network, thus blocking contagion transmission pathways. We formulate various problems to minimize contagion spread and show that some are efficiently solvable while others are formally hard. We also compare our hardness results to those from node blocking problems and show interesting differences between the two. Our main problem is not only hard, but also has no approximation guarantee, unless P=NP. Therefore, we devise a heuristic for the problem and compare its performance to state-of-the-art heuristics from the literature. We show, through results of 12 (network, heuristic) combinations on three real social networks, that our method offers considerable improvement in the ability to block contagions in weighted and unweighted networks. We also conduct a parametric study to understand the limitations of our approach. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

However, both technologies suffer from the problem that sequencing depth of different regions of a genome or genomes from different species are highly uneven. Most existing genome assemblers usually have an assumption that sequencing depths are even. These assemblers fail to construct correct long contigs.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We introduce the IDBA-UD algorithm that is based on the de Bruijn graph approach for assembling reads from single-cell sequencing or metagenomic sequencing technologies with uneven sequencing depths. Several non-trivial techniques have been employed to tackle the problems. Instead of using a simple threshold, we use multiple depthrelative thresholds to remove erroneous k-mers in both low-depth and high-depth regions. The technique of local assembly with paired-end information is used to solve the branch problem of low-depth short repeat regions. To speed up the process, an error correction step is conducted to correct reads of high-depth regions that can be aligned to highconfident contigs. Comparison of the performances of IDBA-UD and existing assemblers (Velvet, Velvet-SC, SOAPdenovo and Meta-IDBA) for different datasets, shows that IDBA-UD can reconstruct longer contigs with higher accuracy.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY: The IDBA-UD toolkit is available at our website http://www.cs.hku.hk/{\~{}}alse/idba{\_}ud},

abstract = {We propose an external memory algorithm for the computation of the BWT and LCP array for a collection of sequences. Our algorithm takes the amount of available memory as an input parameter, and tries to make the best use of it by splitting the input collection into subcollections sufficiently small that it can compute their BWT in RAM using an optimal linear time algorithm. Next, it merges the partial BWTs in external memory and in the process it also computes the LCP values. We prove that our algorithm performs O(n AveLcp) sequential I/Os, where n is the total length of the collection, and AveLcp is the average Longest Common Prefix of the collection. This bound is an improvement over the known algorithms for the same task. The experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms the current best algorithm for collections of sequences with different lengths and for collections with relatively small average Longest Common Prefix. In the second part of the paper, we show that our algorithm can be modified to output two additional arrays that, used with the BWT and LCP arrays, provide simple, scan based, external memory algorithms for three well known problems in bioinformatics: the computation of maximal repeats, the all pairs suffix-prefix overlaps, and the construction of succinct de Bruijn graphs. To our knowledge, there are no other known external memory algorithms for these problems.},

abstract = {How can we optimize the topology of a networked system to bring a flu under control, propel a video to popularity, or stifle a network malware in its infancy? Previous work on information diffusion has focused on modeling the diffusion dynamics and selecting nodes to maximize/minimize influence. Only a paucity of recent studies have attempted to address the network modification problems, where the goal is to either facilitate desirable spreads or curtail undesirable ones by adding or deleting a small subset of network nodes or edges. In this paper, we focus on the widely studied linear threshold diffusion model, and prove, for the first time, that the network modification problems under this model have supermodular objective functions. This surprising property allows us to design efficient data structures and scalable algorithms with provable approximation guarantees, despite the hardness of the problems in question. Both the time and space complexities of our algorithms are linear in the size of the network, which allows us to experiment with millions of nodes and edges. We show that our algorithms outperform an array of heuristics in terms of their effectiveness in controlling diffusion processes, often beating the next best by a significant margin.},

To remedy this problem, we propose a general and systematic study of differentially private submodular maximization. We present privacy-preserving algorithms for both monotone and non-monotone submodular maximization under cardinality, matroid, and p-extendible system constraints, with guarantees that are competitive with optimal. Along the way, we analyze a new algorithm for non-monotone submodular maximization, which is the first (even non-privately) to achieve a constant approximation ratio while running in linear time. We additionally provide two concrete experiments to validate the efficacy of these algorithms.},

Here, we measured activity patterns obtained from multisite local field potential recordings in cortex cultures, urethane-anesthetized rats, and awake macaque monkeys. First, we quantified the information capacity of the pattern repertoire of ongoing and stimulus-evoked activity using Shannon entropy. Next, we quantified the efficacy of information transmission between stimulus and response using mutual information. By systematically changing the ratio of excitation/inhibition (E/I) in vitro and in a network model, we discovered that both information capacity and information transmission are maximized at a particular intermediate E/I, at which ongoing activity emerges as neuronal avalanches. Next, we used our in vitro and model results to correctly predict in vivo information capacity and interactions between neuronal groups during ongoing activity. Close agreement between our experiments and model suggest that neuronal avalanches and peak information capacity arise because of criticality and are general properties of cortical networks with balanced E/I.},

abstract = {In this paper, we discuss consensus problems for networks of dynamic agents with fixed and switching topologies. We analyze three cases: 1) directed networks with fixed topology; 2) directed networks with switching topology; and 3) undirected networks with communication time-delays and fixed topology. We introduce two consensus protocols for networks with and without time-delays and provide a convergence analysis in all three cases. We establish a direct connection between the algebraic connectivity (or Fiedler eigenvalue) of the network and the performance (or negotiation speed) of a linear consensus protocol. This required the generalization of the notion of algebraic connectivity of undirected graphs to digraphs. It turns out that balanced digraphs play a key role in addressing average-consensus problems. We introduce disagreement functions for convergence analysis of consensus protocols. A disagreement function is a Lyapunov function for the disagreement network dynamics. We proposed a simple disagreement function that is a common Lyapunov function for the disagreement dynamics of a directed network with switching topology. A distinctive feature of this work is to address consensus problems for networks with directed information flow. We provide analytical tools that rely on algebraic graph theory, matrix theory, and control theory. Simulations are provided that demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.},

However, we have yet lacked understanding of how social influence affects willingness to maintain these difficult habits with the help of gamification services. In order to investigate this phenomenon, we measured how social influence predicts attitudes, use and further exercise in the context of gamification of exercise. Our results show that people indeed do "work out for likes", or in other words, social influence, positive recognition and reciprocity have a positive impact on how much people are willing to exercise as well as their attitudes and willingness to use gamification services. Moreover, we found that the more friends a user has in the service, the larger the effects are. Furthermore, the findings of the empirical study further provide new understanding on the phenomenon of social influence in technology adoption/use continuance in general by showing, in addition to subjective norms, how getting recognized, receiving reciprocal benefits and network effects contribute to use continuance.},

The main contribution of this paper is an (frac(8, 3) + ??{\{}lunate{\}})-approximation algorithm for partial multicut on a tree, whose run time is strongly polynomial for any fixed ??{\{}lunate{\}} {\textgreater} 0. This result is achieved by introducing problem-specific insight to the general framework of using the Lagrangian relaxation technique in approximation algorithms. Our algorithm utilizes a heuristic for the closely related prize-collecting variant, in which we are not required to disconnect all pairs, but rather incur penalties for failing to do so. We provide a Lagrangian multiplier preserving algorithm for the latter problem, with an approximation factor of 2. Finally, we present a new 2-approximation algorithm for multicut on a tree, based on LP-rounding. ?? 2006.},

abstract = {We present HARP, a novel method for learning low dimensional embeddings of a graph's nodes which preserves higher-order structural features. Our proposed method achieves this by compressing the input graph prior to embedding it, effectively avoiding troublesome embedding configurations (i.e. local minima) which can pose problems to non-convex optimization. HARP works by finding a smaller graph which approximates the global structure of its input. This simplified graph is used to learn a set of initial representations, which serve as good initializations for learning representations in the original, detailed graph. We inductively extend this idea, by decomposing a graph in a series of levels, and then embed the hierarchy of graphs from the coarsest one to the original graph. HARP is a general meta-strategy to improve all of the state-of-the-art neural algorithms for embedding graphs, including DeepWalk, LINE, and Node2vec. Indeed, we demonstrate that applying HARP's hierarchical paradigm yields improved implementations for all three of these methods, as evaluated on both classification tasks on real-world graphs such as DBLP, BlogCatalog, CiteSeer, and Arxiv, where we achieve a performance gain over the original implementations by up to 14{\%} Macro F1.},

abstract = {One of the most central problems in viral marketing is Influence Maximization (IM), which finds a set of {\$}k{\$} seed users who can influence the maximum number of users in online social networks. Unfortunately, all existing algorithms to IM, including the state of the art SSA and IMM, have an approximation ratio of {\$}(1 - 1/e - \backslashepsilon){\$}. Recently, a generalization of IM, Cost-aware Target Viral Marketing (CTVM), asks for the most cost-effective users to influence the most relevant users, has been introduced. The current best algorithm for CTVM has an approximation ratio of {\$}(1 - 1 /\backslashsqrt{\{}e{\}} - \backslashepsilon){\$}. In this paper, we study the CTVM problem, aiming to optimally solve the problem. We first highlight that using a traditional two stage stochastic programming to exactly solve CTVM is not possible because of scalability. We then propose an almost exact algorithm TipTop, which has an approximation ratio of {\$}(1 - \backslashepsilon){\$}. This result significantly improves the current best solutions to both IM and CTVM. At the heart of TipTop lies an innovative technique that reduces the number of samples as much as possible. This allows us to exactly solve CTVM on a much smaller space of generated samples using Integer Programming. While obtaining an almost exact solution, TipTop is very scalable, running on billion-scale networks such as Twitter under three hours. Furthermore, TipTop lends a tool for researchers to benchmark their solutions against the optimal one in large-scale networks, which is currently not available.},

Using the analytical approach originally applied to clique-based random networks, we show that the system exhibits a bond-percolation type continuous phase transition for weak social reinforcement, whereas a discontinuous phase transition occurs for sufficiently strong social reinforcement.

Specifically, given an undirected graph G, the objective of triangle listing is to find all the cliques involving 3 vertices in G. The problem has been well studied in internal memory, but remains an urgent difficult challenge when G does not fit in memory, rendering any algorithm to entail frequent I/O accesses. Although previous research has attempted to tackle the challenge, the state-of-the-art solutions rely on a set of crippling assumptions to guarantee good performance. Motivated by this, we develop a new algorithm that is provably I/O and CPU efficient at the same time, without making any assumption on the input G at all. The algorithm uses ideas drastically different from all the previous approaches, and outperformed the existing competitors by a factor over an order of magnitude in our extensive experimentation.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on line failures in the transmission system of power grids. Recent large-scale power outages demonstrated the limitations of percolation- and epidemic-based tools in modeling failures and cascades in power grids. Hence, we study failures and cascades by using computational tools and a linearized power flow model. We first obtain results regarding the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse of the power grid admittance matrix. Based on these results, we analytically study the impact of a single line failure on the flows on other lines and introduce metrics to evaluate the robustness of grids to failures. We also illustrate via simulation the impact of the distance and resistance distance on the flow increase following a failure, and discuss the difference from the epidemic models. We use the pseudoinverse of admittance matrix to develop an efficient algorithm to identify the cascading failure evolution, which can be a building block for cascade mitigation. Finally, we show that finding the lines whose removal results in the minimum yield (the fraction of demand satisfied after the cascade) is NP-Hard and present a simple heuristic for finding such a set . Overall, the results demonstrate that using the resistance distance and the pseudoinverse of admittance matrix provides important insights and can support the development of algorithms for designing robust power grids and controlling the evolution of a cascade upon failures.},

abstract = {In most natural and engineered systems, a set of entities interact with each other in complicated patterns that can encompass multiple types of relationships, change in time and include other types of complications. Such systems include multiple subsystems and layers of connectivity, and it is important to take such 'multilayer' features into account to try to improve our understanding of complex systems. Consequently, it is necessary to generalize 'traditional' network theory by developing (and validating) a framework and associated tools to study multilayer systems in a comprehensive fashion. The origins of such efforts date back several decades and arose in multiple disciplines, and now the study of multilayer networks has become one of the most important directions in network science. In this paper, we discuss the history of multilayer networks (and related concepts) and review the exploding body of work on such networks. To unify the disparate terminology in the large body of recent work, we discuss a general framework for multilayer networks, construct a dictionary of terminology to relate the numerous existing concepts to each other and provide a thorough discussion that compares, contrasts and translates between related notions such as multilayer networks, multiplex networks, interdependent networks, networks of networks and many others. We also survey and discuss existing data sets that can be represented as M. KIVEL{\"{A}} ET AL. multilayer networks. We review attempts to generalize singlelayernetwork diagnostics to multilayer networks. We also discuss the rapidly expanding research on multilayernetwork models and notions like community structure, connected components, tensor decompositions and various types of dynamical processes on multilayer networks. We conclude with a summary and an outlook.},

abstract = {Identifying critical nodes in a graph is important to understand the structural characteristics and the connectivity properties of the network. In this paper, we focus on detecting critical nodes, or nodes whose deletion results in the minimum pair-wise connectivity among the remaining nodes. This problem, known as the critical node problem has applications in several fields including biomedicine, telecommunications, and military strategic planning. We show that the recognition version of the problem is NP-complete and derive a mathematical formulation based on integer linear programming. In addition, we propose a heuristic for the problem which exploits the combinatorial structure of the graph. The heuristic is then enhanced by the application of a local improvement method. A computational study is presented in which we apply the integer programming formulation and the heuristic to real and randomly generated data sets. For all instances tested, the heuristic is able to efficiently provide optimal solutions in a fraction of the time required by a commercial software package.},

abstract = {Effective management of critical network infrastructure requires the assessment of potential interdiction scenarios. Optimization approaches have been essential for identifying and evaluating such scenarios in networked systems. Although a primary function of any network is the distribution of flow between origins and destinations, the complexity and difficulty of mathematically abstracting interdiction impacts on connectivity or flow has been a challenge for researchers. This paper presents an optimization approach for identifying interdiction bounds with respect to connectivity and/or flow associated with a system of origins and destinations. Application results for telecommunications flow are presented, illustrating the capabilities of this approach. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

This perspective grants women little agency and neglects their simultaneous location in other social structures. In this article we synthesize insights from social psychology, gender, and culture to argue that undergrad- uate women use slut stigma to draw boundaries around status groups linked to social class—while also regulating sexual behavior and gender performance. High-status women employ slut discourse to assert class advantage, defining themselves as classy rather than tra- shy, while low-status women express class resentment—deriding rich, bitchy sluts for their exclusivity. Slut discourse enables, rather than constrains, sexual experimentation for the high-status women whose definitions prevail in the dominant social scene. This is a form of sexual privilege. In contrast, low-status women risk public shaming when they attempt to enter dominant social worlds.},

abstract = {Many real-world networks display natural bipartite structure, where the basic cycle is a square. In this paper, with the similar consideration of standard clustering coefficient in binary networks, a definition of the clustering coefficient for bipartite networks based on the fraction of squares is proposed. In order to detect community structures in bipartite networks, two different edge clustering coefficients L C4 and L C3 of bipartite networks are defined, which are based on squares and triples respectively. With the algorithm of cutting the edge with the least clustering coefficient, communities in artificial and real world networks are identified. The results reveal that investigating bipartite networks based on the original structure can show the detailed properties that is helpful to get deep understanding about the networks. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We establish both proper and improper PAC learnability of influence functions under randomly missing observations. Proper PAC learnability under the Discrete-Time Linear Threshold (DLT) and Discrete-Time Independent Cascade (DIC) models is established by reducing incomplete observations to complete observations in a modified graph. Our improper PAC learnability result applies for the DLT and DIC models as well as the Continuous-Time Independent Cascade (CIC) model. It is based on a parametrization in terms of reachability features, and also gives rise to an efficient and practical heuristic. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the ability of our method to compensate even for a fairly large fraction of missing observations.},

Instead, we use another coefficient given by the fraction of cycles with size four, showing that both coefficients yield the same clustering properties. The new coefficient is computed for two networks of sexual contacts, one bipartite and another where no distinction between the nodes is made (monopartite). In both cases the clustering coefficient is similar. Furthermore, combining both clustering coefficients we deduce an expression for estimating cycles of larger size, which improves previous estimations and is suitable for either monopartite and multipartite networks, and discuss the applicability of such analytical estimations.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE. While online social networks provide access to a massive information source, they also enable wide dissemination of false or inaccurate content. Undesirable results caused by misinformation propagation make its timely detection very imperative. An important question is how many monitors are required to detect all misinformation cascades at their early stage. To answer this question, we define a Time Constrained Misinformation Detection (TCMD) problem. As we have proved, there is no polynomial time (1 - ϵ) ln n-approximation for the TCMD problem. The large number of independent misinformation cascades and heterogeneous delays make misinformation detection more challenging. Our approach includes stochastic programming and an O(ln(1 + n)) approximation algorithm for one-hop detection. This approach can provide a lower bound on the number of required monitors for general detection. Furthermore, we propose a network-compression based solution, whose effectiveness is validated by extensive experimental results.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE. Many complex systems, from World Wide Web and online social networks to mobile networks, exhibit community structure in which nodes can be grouped into densely interconnected communities. This special structure has been exploited extensively to design better solutions for many operations and applications such as routing in wireless networks, worm containment and interest prediction in social networks. The outcome of these solutions are sensitive to the network structures, which raises an important question: can communities be broken easily in a network? To answer this question, we introduce a density-based problem formulation for analyzing the vulnerability of communities. Our approach includes the NP-completeness and a O(log k) approximation algorithm for solving the problem where k is the number of communities to be broken. Additionally, we analyze the vulnerability of communities in the context of arbitrary community detection algorithms. The empirical results show that communities are vulnerable to edge removal and in some cases the removal of a small fraction of edges can break the community structure.},

These representations can be used as features for a wide range of tasks on graphs such as classification, clustering, link prediction, and visualization. In this survey, we give an overview of network embeddings by summarizing and categorizing recent advancements in this research field. We first discuss the desirable properties of network embeddings and briefly introduce the history of network embedding algorithms. Then, we discuss network embedding methods under different scenarios, such as supervised versus unsupervised learning, learning embeddings for homogeneous networks versus for heterogeneous networks, etc. We further demonstrate the applications of network embeddings, and conclude the survey with future work in this area.},

abstract = {Symmetric positive-definite (SPD) matrices are ubiquitous in Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Medical Image Analysis. Finding the center/average of a population of such matrices is a common theme in many algorithms such as clustering, segmentation, principal geodesic analysis, etc. The center of a population of such matrices can be defined using a variety of distance/divergence measures as the minimizer of the sum of squared distances/divergences from the unknown center to the members of the population. It is well known that the computation of the Karcher mean for the space of SPD matrices which is a negatively-curved Riemannian manifold is computationally expensive. Recently, the LogDet divergence-based center was shown to be a computationally attractive alternative. However, the LogDet-based mean of more than two matrices can not be computed in closed form, which makes it computationally less attractive for large populations. In this paper we present a novel recursive estimator for center based on the Stein distance - which is the square root of the LogDet divergence - that is significantly faster than the batch mode computation of this center. The key theoretical contribution is a closed-form solution for the weighted Stein center of two SPD matrices, which is used in the recursive computation of the Stein center for a population of SPD matrices. Additionally, we show experimental evidence of the convergence of our recursive Stein center estimator to the batch mode Stein center. We present applications of our recursive estimator to K-means clustering and image indexing depicting significant time gains over corresponding algorithms that use the batch mode computations. For the latter application, we develop novel hashing functions using the Stein distance and apply it to publicly available data sets, and experimental results have shown favorable comparisons to other competing methods.},

abstract = {The notion of centrality is used to identify “important” nodes in social networks. Importance of nodes is not well-defined, and many different notions exist in the literature. The challenge of defining centrality in meaningful ways when network edges can be positively or negatively weighted has not been adequately addressed in the literature. Existing centrality algorithms also have a second shortcoming, i.e., the list of the most central nodes are often clustered in a specific region of the network and are not well represented across the network. We address both by proposing Ablatio Triadum (ATria), an iterative centrality algorithm that uses the concept of “payoffs” from economic theory. We compare our algorithm with other known centrality algorithms and demonstrate how ATria overcomes several of their shortcomings. We demonstrate the applicability of our algorithm to synthetic networks as well as biological networks including bacterial co-occurrence networks, sometimes referred to as microbial social networks. We show evidence that ATria identifies three different kinds of “important” nodes in microbial social networks with different potential roles in the community.},

abstract = {Network science spans many different fields of study, ranging from psychology to biology to the social sciences. A number of descriptive network measures have been identified for use within these fields; however, little research examines the relationships of these measures for possible statistical dependence. The research presented in this paper uses Spearman's rank correlation coefficient to examine the statistical dependence between pairs of 24 widely accepted social network measures. Confidence intervals are compared to determine whether computation times between measures in the same correlation group are significantly different. We use a three-factor, four-level, full-factorial experimental design to construct a test set of 64 unique network topologies. The three factors of interest are the network structural properties of size, clusterability, and the scale-free parameter. A set of 320 networks are generated from a power law degree distribution using a random graph generation algorithm. Results indicate that there exists high correlation among 14 of the 24 tested network measures, many of which also exhibit statistically significant differences with respect to computation time. These findings are of interest to analysts seeking to identify measures that provide similar ranked outcomes and where computational efficiency is an important consideration.},

abstract = {As a generalization of many classic problems in combinatorial optimization, submodular optimization has found a wide range of applications in machine learning (e.g., in feature engineering and active learning). For many large-scale optimization problems, we are often concerned with the adaptivity complexity of an algorithm, which quantifies the number of sequential rounds where polynomially-many independent function evaluations can be executed in parallel. While low adaptivity is ideal, it is not sufficient for a (distributed) algorithm to be efficient, since in many practical applications of submodular optimization the number of function evaluations becomes prohibitively expensive. Motivated by such applications, we study the adaptivity and query complexity of adaptive submodular optimization. Our main result is a distributed algorithm for maximizing a monotone submodular function with cardinality constraint {\$}k{\$} that achieves a {\$}(1-1/e-\backslashvarepsilon){\$}-approximation in expectation. Furthermore, this algorithm runs in {\$}O(\backslashlog(n)){\$} adaptive rounds and makes {\$}O(n){\$} calls to the function evaluation oracle in expectation. All three of these guarantees are optimal, and the query complexity is substantially less than in previous works. Finally, to show the generality of our simple algorithm and techniques, we extend our results to the submodular cover problem.},

abstract = {Low latency analytics on geographically distributed dat- asets (across datacenters, edge clusters) is an upcoming and increasingly important challenge. The dominant approach of aggregating all the data to a single data- center significantly inflates the timeliness of analytics. At the same time, running queries over geo-distributed inputs using the current intra-DC analytics frameworks also leads to high query response times because these frameworks cannot cope with the relatively low and variable capacity of WAN links. We present Iridium, a system for low latency geo-distri- buted analytics. Iridium achieves low query response times by optimizing placement of both data and tasks of the queries. The joint data and task placement op- timization, however, is intractable. Therefore, Iridium uses an online heuristic to redistribute datasets among the sites prior to queries' arrivals, and places the tasks to reduce network bottlenecks during the query's ex- ecution. Finally, it also contains a knob to budget WAN usage. Evaluation across eight worldwide EC2 re- gions using production queries show that Iridium speeds up queries by 3× − 19× and lowers WAN usage by 15{\%}−64{\%} compared to existing baselines.},

abstract = {Whilst the future for social media in chronic disease management appears to be optimistic, there is limited concrete evidence indicating whether and how social media use significantly improves patient outcomes. This review examines the health outcomes and related effects of using social media, while also exploring the unique affordances underpinning these effects. Few studies have investigated social media's potential in chronic disease, but those we found indicate impact on health status and other effects are positive, with none indicating adverse events. Benefits have been reported for psychosocial management via the ability to foster support and share information; however, there is less evidence of benefits for physical condition management. We found that studies covered a very limited range of social media platforms and that there is an ongoing propensity towards reporting investigations of earlier social platforms, such as online support groups (OSG), discussion forums and message boards. Finally, it is hypothesized that for social media to form a more meaningful part of effective chronic disease management, interventions need to be tailored to the individualized needs of sufferers. The particular affordances of social media that appear salient in this regard from analysis of the literature include: identity, flexibility, structure, narration and adaptation. This review suggests further research of high methodological quality is required to investigate the affordances of social media and how these can best serve chronic disease sufferers. Evidence-based practice (EBP) using social media may then be considered. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Recent research on social contagion has demonstrated significant ef-fects of network topology on the dynamics of diffusion. However, net-work topologies are not given a priori. Rather, they are patterns of re-lations that emerge from individual and structural features of society, such as population composition, group heterogeneity, homophily, and social consolidation. Following Blau and Schwartz, the author devel-ops a model of social network formation that explores how social and structural constraints on tie formation generate emergent social topol-ogies and then explores the effectiveness of these social networks for the dynamics of social diffusion. Results show that, at one extreme, high levels of consolidation can create highly balkanized communities with poor integration of shared norms and practices. As suggested by Blau and Schwartz, reducing consolidation creates more crosscut-ting circles and significantly improves the dynamics of social diffusion across the population. However, the author finds that further reduc-ing consolidation creates highly intersecting social networks that fail to support the widespread diffusion of norms and practices, indicating that successful social diffusion can depend on moderate to high levels of structural consolidation. Recent theoretical and empirical studies on the spread of social norms have identified the importance of network topology—the large-scale pattern of ties within a population—for determining both the rate and extent of dif-fusion processes ðWatts and This content downloaded from 165.123.34.86 on Mon, 1 Jun 2015 01:08:35 AM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions man, Barabasi, and Watts 2006; Centola and Macy 2007; Centola 2010Þ. While much of the literature on networks treats the topological features of social structure as given quantities, networks do not emerge ex nihilo, but are endogenously formed patterns of relationships that are created by individual and institutional forces that constrain and direct everyday in-teractions ðBlau 1977; McPherson and Smith-Lovin 1987; McPherson, Po-pielarz, and Drobnic 1992; Popielarz and McPherson 1995; Watts, Dodds, and Newman 2002; Kossinets and Watts 2009Þ. For instance, at the indi-vidual level, choice homophily—people's preference to form social con-nections with others who are like themselves—is a powerful force that controls the formation of social ties ðVerbrugge 1977; Blau and Schwartz 1984; Shrum, Cheek, and Hunter 1988; McPherson, Smith-Lovin, and Cook 2001; Reagans 2005; Currarini, Jackson, and Pin 2010; Centola and van de Rijt 2015Þ. At the level of social structure, organizational and in-stitutional contexts form the basis for social interaction ðBlau 1977; Mc-Pherson et al. 1992; McPherson 2004Þ, and the distribution and consolida-tion of characteristics across a population determine the frequency with which people with diverse characteristics come in contact with one another ðBlau 1977; Blau and Schwartz 1984; McPherson et al. 1992Þ. Together, these forces help to shape the collective pattern of network ties that emerges within a society. These individual and institutional forces can thereby indirectly affect the potential for social integration. Classic work by Blau and Schwartz ð1984Þ on the relationship between social institutions and emergent network struc-tures found that " consolidated " societies—where one's friends, colleagues, and neighbors are all the same people—limit social integration across the society by preventing the formation of " cross-cutting social ties " between diverse social groups. I take Blau and Schwartz's structural theory one step further by investigating social integration as a diffusion process—in particular, the spread of shared cultural practices and social norms throughout a popu-lation ðBoyd and Richerson 1985; Castro and Toro 2004; Centola and Macy 2007Þ. The central goal of this article is to explore how changes in a society's population structure affect these forms of social diffusion. I proceed by first investigating how the " primitive " structural parame-ters of homophily and consolidation ðSkvoretz 1983; Blau and Schwartz 1984Þ control the formation of social networks with distinct topological properties—such as clustering, path length, and bridge width. I then explore the effectiveness of these emergent networks for promoting the spread of},

This paper quantitatively evaluates the reliability of modern power systems, which incorporates the impact of cyber network failures on the reliability of the power network. In this paper, four types of interdependencies are defined and a new concept of state mapping is proposed to map the failures in the cyber network to the failures of the power network. Furthermore, in order to evaluate the impact of direct cyber-power interdependencies on the reliability indices, two optimization models are introduced to maximize the data connection in the cyber network and minimize the load shedding in the power network. The effectiveness of proposed reliability evaluation method is shown by a smart microgrid application. The methodology presented in this paper is a start point to optimize the future power grid which has increasingly interdependencies between cyber and power networks.},

abstract = {We introduce FlowCutter, a novel algorithm to compute a set of edge cuts or node separators that optimize cut size and balance in the Pareto-sense. Our core algorithm solves the balanced connected st-edge-cut problem, where two given nodes s and t must be separated by removing edges to obtain two connected parts. Using the core algorithm we build variants that compute node-cuts and are independent of s and t. Using the Pareto-set we can identify cuts with a particularly good trade-off that can be used to compute contraction and minimum fill-in orders. Our core algorithm has a running time in O(cm) where m is the number of edges and c the cut size. This makes it well-suited for large graphs with very small cuts, such as road graphs, which are our primary application.},

abstract = {Long read technologies have made a revolution in de novo genome assembly by generating contigs of size orders of magnitude more than that of short read assemblies. Although the assembly contiguity has increased, it still does not span a chromosome or an arm of the chromosome, resulting in an unfinished chromosome level assembly. To address this problem, we develop a scalable and computationally efficient scaffolding method that can boost the contiguity of the assembly by a large extent using genome wide chromatin interaction data such as Hi-C. Particularly, we demonstrate an algorithm that uses Hi-C data for longer-range scaffolding of de novo long read genome assemblies. We tested our methods on two long read assemblies of different organisms. We compared our method with previously developed method and show that our approach performs better in terms of accuracy of scaffolding.

We focus our analysis on a two community structure where the initial set of informed nodes lies only in one of the two communities and we look for optimal network structures, i.e. those maximizing the asymptotic extent of the diffusion. We find that, constraining the mean degree and the fraction of initially informed nodes, the optimal structure can be assortative (modular), core-periphery, or even disassortative. We then look for minimal cost structures, i.e. those such that a minimal fraction of initially informed nodes is needed to trigger a global cascade. We find that the optimal networks are assortative but with a structure very close to a core-periphery graph, i.e. a very dense community linked to a much more sparsely connected periphery.},

abstract = {Real-time demand response is essential for handling the uncertainties of renewable generation. Traditionally, demand response has been focused on large industrial and commercial loads, however it is expected that a large number of small residential loads such as air conditioners, dish washers, and electric vehicles will also participate in the coming years. The electricity consumption of these smaller loads, which we call deferrable loads, can be shifted over time, and thus be used (in aggregate) to compensate for the random fluctuations in renewable generation. In this paper, we propose a real-time distributed deferrable load control algorithm to reduce the variance of aggregate load (load minus renewable generation) by shifting the power consumption of deferrable loads to periods with high renewable generation. At every time step, the algorithm minimizes the expected variance to go with updated predictions. We prove that suboptimality of the algorithm vanishes as time horizon expands. Further, we evaluate the algorithm via trace-based simulations.},

This diversity is increasingly catalogued in repositories such as ExAC/gnomAD, consisting of {\textgreater}15,000 whole-genomes and {\textgreater}126,000 exome sequences from different individuals. Despite this enormous diversity, resequencing data workflows are still based on a single human reference genome. Identification and genotyping of genetic variants is typically carried out on short-read data aligned to a single reference, disregarding the underlying variation. Results: We propose a new unified framework for variant calling with short-read data utilizing a representation of human genetic variation-a pan-genomic reference. We provide a modular pipeline that can be seamlessly incorporated into existing sequencing data analysis workflows. Our tool is open source and available online: https://gitlab.com/dvalenzu/PanVC. Conclusions: Our experiments show that by replacing a standard human reference with a pan-genomic one we achieve an improvement in single-nucleotide variant calling accuracy and in short indel calling accuracy over the widely adopted Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) in difficult genomic regions.},

Although many researches have been done, the evolving feature of information diffusion hasn't been well treated, including the promising direction of group-level popularity prediction. To this end, we identify the Incremental Group-level Popularity Prediction (IGPP) problem, and propose a novel model IGP-P to address it. We first conduct preprocess on the target topic being predicted, so as to build the initial group-level popularity tensor. Then, we predict the group-level popularity incrementally by exploiting the incremental CP decomposition algorithm. To reduce the cumulative error by incremental prediction, we propose two strategies to restart the CP decomposition. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments in two real datasets. The results show significant improvements of the IGPP method over other works both in the prediction accuracy and the efficiency.

abstract = {Hybrid indexing is a recent approach to text indexing that allows the space-usage of conventional text indexes (e.g., suffix trees, suffix arrays, FM-indexes) to scale well with the text size, n, when z, the size of the Lempel-Ziv parsing of the text, is small relative to n. The price for this improved scalability is that an upper bound M on the pattern length that can be searched for must be declared at index construction time. Because the size of the resulting index contains an O(M z) term, M must be kept reasonably small, though it has been shown that M ≈ 100 leads to acceptable performance in some genomic applications. However, despite its promise, the practical performance of hybrid indexing relative to other compressed index data structures is poorly understood. This paper addresses that need, detailing experiments that show hybrid indexing — when carefully implemented — to be significantly smaller and faster than alternative approaches on a broad range of data of different levels of compressibility. We also describe practical extensions to hybrid indexing that obviate the restriction on M , supporting search for patterns of arbitrary length.},

abstract = {An instance of the generalized partial cover problem consists of a ground set U and a family of subsets S ⊆ 2 U . Each element e ∈ U is associated with a profit p(e), whereas each subset S ∈ S has a cost c(S). The objective is to find a minimum cost subcollection S ⊆ S such that the combined profit of the elements covered by S is at least P , a specified profit bound. In the prize-collecting version of this problem, there is no strict requirement to cover any element; however, if the subsets we pick leave an element e ∈ U uncovered, we incur a penalty of $\pi$(e). The goal is to identify a subcollection S ⊆ S that minimizes the cost of S plus the penalties of uncovered elements. Although problem-specific connections between the partial cover and the prize-collecting vari-ants of a given covering problem have been explored and exploited, a more general connection remained open. The main contribution of this paper is to establish a formal relationship between these two variants. As a result, we present a unified framework for approximating problems that can be formulated or interpreted as special cases of generalized partial cover. We demonstrate the applicability of our method on a diverse collection of covering problems, for some of which we obtain the first non-trivial approximability results.},

In this paper, we first propose a general representation for multiple networks using universal ids for the users. We next introduce a powerful coupling scheme which reduces the multiple networks into a single network without changing influencing properties, thereby allowing us to solve the problem in the reduced network. Moreover, the coupling scheme is also an efficient tool to investigate various aspects of the influence propagation on multiple OSNs. The extensive experiments on real-world and synthesized datasets not only confirm the quality of the solution but also reveal interesting insights into the behavior of influence propagation in and across the networks.},

abstract = {In recent years, study of influence propagation in social networks has gained tremendous attention. In this context, we can identify three orthogonal dimensions—the number of seed nodes activated at the beginning (known as budget ), the expected number of activated nodes at the end of the propagation (known as expected spread or coverage ), and the time taken for the propagation. We can constrain one or two of these and try to optimize the third. In their seminal paper, Kempe et al. constrained the budget, left time unconstrained, and maximized the coverage: this problem is known as Influence Maximization (or MAXINF for short). In this paper, we study alternative optimization problems which are naturally motivated by resource and time constraints on viral marketing campaigns. In the first problem, termed minimum target set selection (or MINTSS for short), a coverage threshold $\eta$ is given and the task is to find the minimum size seed set such that by activating it, at least $\eta$ nodes are eventually activated in the expected sense. This naturally captures the problem of deploying a viral campaign on a budget. In the second problem, termed MINTIME, the goal is to minimize the time in which a predefined coverage is achieved. More precisely, in MINTIME, a coverage threshold $\eta$ and a budget threshold k are given, and the task is to find a seed set of size at most k such that by activating it, at least $\eta$ nodes are activated in the expected sense, in the minimum possible time . This problem addresses the issue of timing when deploying viral campaigns. Both these problems are NP -hard, which motivates our interest in their approximation. For MINTSS, we develop a simple greedy algorithm and show that it provides a bicriteria approximation. We also establish a generic hardness result suggesting that improving this bicriteria approximation is likely to be hard. For MINTIME, we show that even bicriteria and tricriteria approximations are hard under several conditions. We show, however, that if we allow the budget for number of seeds k to be boosted by a logarithmic factor and allow the coverage to fall short, then the problem can be solved exactly in PTIME, i.e., we can achieve the required coverage within the time achieved by the optimal solution to MINTIME with budget k and coverage threshold $\eta$. Finally, we establish the value of the approximation algorithms, by conducting an experimental evaluation, comparing their quality against that achieved by various heuristics.},

abstract = {Models of networked diffusion that are motivated by analogy with the spread of infectious disease have been applied to a wide range of social and economic adoption processes, including those related to new products, ideas, norms and behaviors. However, it is unknown how accurately these models account for the empirical structure of diffusion over networks. Here we describe the diffusion patterns arising from seven online domains, ranging from communications platforms to networked games to microblogging services, each involving distinct types of content and modes of sharing.We find strikingly similar patterns across all domains. In particular, the vast majority of cascades are small, and are described by a handful of simple tree structures that terminate within one degree of an initial adopting “seed.” In addition we find that structures other than these account for only a tiny fraction of total adoptions; that is, adoptions resulting from chains of referrals are extremely rare. Finally, even for the largest cascades that we observe, we find that the bulk of adoptions often takes place within one degree of a few dominant individuals. Together, these observations suggest new directions for modeling of online adoption processes.},

abstract = {A considerable amount of research effort has focused on developing metrics and approaches to assess network vulnerability. However, most of them neglect the network uncertainty arisen due to various reasons such as mobility and dynamics of the network, or noise introduced in data collection process. To this end, we introduce a framework to assess vulnerability of networks with uncertainty, modeling such networks as probabilistic graphs. We adopt expected pairwise connectivity (EPC) as a measure to quantify global connectivity and use it to formulate vulnerability assessment as a stochastic optimization problem. The objective is to identify a few number of critical nodes whose removal minimizes EPC in the residual network. While solutions for stochastic optimization problems are often limited to small networks, we present a practical solution that works for larger networks. The key advantages of our solution include 1) the application of a weighted averaging technique that avoids considering all, exponentially many, possible realizations of probabilistic graphs and 2) a Fully Polynomial Time Randomized Approximation Scheme (FPRAS) to efficiently estimate the EPC with any desired accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvement on performance of our solution over other heuristic approaches.},

abstract = {Tree search algorithms, such as branch-and-bound, are the most widely used tools for solving combinatorial and nonconvex problems. For example, they are the foremost method for solving (mixed) integer programs and constraint satisfaction problems. Tree search algorithms recursively partition the search space to find an optimal solution. In order to keep the tree size small, it is crucial to carefully decide, when expanding a tree node, which question (typically variable) to branch on at that node in order to partition the remaining space. Numerous partitioning techniques (e.g., variable selection) have been proposed, but there is no theory describing which technique is optimal. We show how to use machine learning to determine an optimal weighting of any set of partitioning procedures for the instance distribution at hand using samples from the distribution. We provide the first sample complexity guarantees for tree search algorithm configuration. These guarantees bound the number of samples sufficient to ensure that the empirical performance of an algorithm over the samples nearly matches its expected performance on the unknown instance distribution. This thorough theoretical investigation naturally gives rise to our learning algorithm. Via experiments, we show that learning an optimal weighting of partitioning procedures can dramatically reduce tree size, and we prove that this reduction can even be exponential. Through theory and experiments, we show that learning to branch is both practical and hugely beneficial.},

abstract = {We analyze the dynamics of spreading processes taking place over time-varying networks. A common heuristic is to use an aggregated static network based on time averages. Instead, we introduce a flexible and tractable random graph process that extends the family of Markovian random graphs (MRG). One of the main limitations of MRG's is that it can only replicate switching patterns with exponential inter-switching times. To overcome this limitation, we propose the family of aggregated-Markovian random graph processes, which is able to replicate, with arbitrary accuracy, any distribution of inter-switching times. We study the stability spreading processes in this extended family. We first show that a direct analysis based on the It$\backslash${\^{}}o formula provide conditions in terms of the eigenvalues of a matrix whose size grows exponentially with the number of edges. Using alternative tools, we derive stability conditions involving the eigenvalues of a matrix whose size grows linearly with the number of nodes. Based on our results, we show that the aggregated static network approximates the epidemic threshold more accurately as the number of nodes grows, or the temporal volatility of the random graph process is reduced. Apart from these theoretical results, we illustrate our findings via numerical simulations.},

abstract = {The eigenvector centrality has been traditionally used to quantify the importance of a node in a network. The main contribution of the eigenvector centrality is that it takes into account the importance of the node's neighbours by giving a score to the node that is proportional to the scores of all its connected nodes. In this way, the mathematical definition of the eigenvector centrality x k of a node k is related to an iterative process were the centrality is calculated as the sum of the centralities of its neighbours: x k = $\gamma$ −1 j G kj x j , (1) where $\gamma$ is a constant, x k is the eigenvector centrality of node k and G kj are the components of the adjacency matrix. In matrix notation Eq. S1 reads $\gamma$ x = G x so that x can be expressed as a linear combination of the eigenvectors v k of the adjacency matrix G, being $\gamma$ k the set of the corresponding eigenvalues. Note that Eq. S1 can be regarded as an iterative process that begins at t = 0 with a set of initial conditions x 0 . No matter what the values of x 0 are, the value of x k (t) at t → ∞ will be proportional to the eigenvector v 1 associated to the dominant eigenvalue $\gamma$ 1 . Therefore, the eigenvector centrality is directly obtained from the eigenvector v 1 of the adjacency matrix G. The concept of eigenvector centrality can be easily extended to weighted connectivity matrices, where the weight of the connections w kj is proportional to the amount of interaction between two nodes. In the case of a weighted connectivity matrix W, we have that $\lambda$ x = W x, and the eigenvector centrality will be, in this case, obtained from eigenvector u 1 of the weighted matrix W [1].},

abstract = {Submodular functions are a broad class of set functions, which naturally arise in diverse areas. Many algorithms have been suggested for the maximization of these functions. Unfortunately, once the function deviates from submodularity, the known algorithms may perform arbitrarily poorly. Amending this issue, by obtaining approximation results for set functions generalizing submodular functions, has been the focus of recent works. One such class, known as weakly submodular functions, has received a lot of attention. A key result proved by Das and Kempe (2011) showed that the approximation ratio of the greedy algorithm for weakly submodular maximization subject to a cardinality constraint degrades smoothly with the distance from submodularity. However, no results have been obtained for maximization subject to constraints beyond cardinality. In particular, it is not known whether the greedy algorithm achieves any non-trivial approximation ratio for such constraints. In this paper, we prove that a randomized version of the greedy algorithm (previously used by Buchbinder et al. (2014) for a different problem) achieves an approximation ratio of {\$}(1 + 1/\backslashgamma){\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}{\$} for the maximization of a weakly submodular function subject to a general matroid constraint, where {\$}\backslashgamma{\$} is a parameter measuring the distance of the function from submodularity. Moreover, we also experimentally compare the performance of this version of the greedy algorithm on real world problems against natural benchmarks, and show that the algorithm we study performs well also in practice. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm with a non-trivial approximation guarantee for maximizing a weakly submodular function subject to a constraint other than the simple cardinality constraint. In particular, it is the first algorithm with such a guarantee for the important and broad class of matroid constraints.},

We introduce the submodularity ratio as a key quantity to help understand why greedy algorithms perform well even when the variables are highly correlated. Using our techniques, we obtain the strongest known approximation guarantees for this problem, both in terms of the submodularity ratio and the smallest k-sparse eigenvalue of the covariance matrix. We further demonstrate the wide applicability of our techniques by analyzing greedy algorithms for the dictionary selection problem, and significantly improve the previously known guarantees. Our theoretical analysis is complemented by experiments on real-world and synthetic data sets; the experiments show that the submodularity ratio is a stronger predictor of the performance of greedy algorithms than other spectral parameters.},

abstract = {There has been much progress recently on improved approximations for problems involving submodular objective functions, and many interesting techniques have been developed. However, the resulting algorithms are often slow and impractical. In this paper we develop algorithms that match the best known approximation guarantees, but with significantly improved running times, for maximizing a monotone submodular function f: 2[n] → R+ subject to various constraints. As in previous work, we measure the number of oracle calls to the objective function which is the dominating term in the running time. Our first result is a simple algorithm that gives a (1--1/e -- $\epsilon$)-approximation for a cardinality constraint using O(n/$\epsilon$ log n/$\epsilon$) queries, and a 1/(p + 2ℓ + 1 + $\epsilon$)-approximation for the intersection of a p-system and ℓ knapsack (linear) constraints using O (n/$\epsilon$2 log2 n/$\epsilon$) queries. This is the first approximation for a p-system combined with linear constraints. (We also show that the factor of p cannot be improved for maximizing over a p-system.) The main idea behind these algorithms serves as a building block in our more sophisticated algorithms. Our main result is a new variant of the continuous greedy algorithm, which interpolates between the classical greedy algorithm and a truly continuous algorithm. We show how this algorithm can be implemented for matroid and knapsack constraints using {\~{O}}(n2) oracle calls to the objective function. (Previous variants and alternative techniques were known to use at least {\~{O}}(n4) oracle calls.) This leads to an O(n2/$\epsilon$4 log2 n/$\epsilon$)-time (1--1/e -- $\epsilon$)-approximation for a matroid constraint. For a knapsack constraint, we develop a more involved (1--1/e -- $\epsilon$)-approximation algorithm that runs in time O(n2(1/$\epsilon$ log n)poly(1/$\epsilon$)).},

abstract = {This book covers the dominant theoretical approaches to the approximate solution of hard combinatorial optimization and enumeration problems. It contains elegant combinatorial theory, useful and interesting algorithms, and deep results about the intrinsic complexity of combinatorial problems. Its clarity of exposition and excellent selection of exercises will make it accessible and appealing to all those with a taste for mathematics and algorithms. Richard Karp,University Professor, University of California at Berkeley Following the development of basic combinatorial optimization techniques in the 1960s and 1970s, a main open question was to develop a theory of approximation algorithms. In the 1990s, parallel developments in techniques for designing approximation algorithms as well as methods for proving hardness of approximation results have led to a beautiful theory. The need to solve truly large instances of computationally hard problems, such as those arising from the Internet or the human genome project, has also increased interest in this theory. The field is currently very active, with the toolbox of approximation algorithm design techniques getting always richer. It is a pleasure to recommend Vijay Vazirani's well-written and comprehensive book on this important and timely topic. I am sure the reader will find it most useful both as an introduction to approximability as well as a reference to the many aspects of approximation algorithms.

abstract = {It is known that greedy methods perform well for maximizing monotone submodular functions. At the same time, such methods perform poorly in the face of non-monotonicity. In this paper, we show - arguably, surprisingly - that invoking the classical greedy algorithm {\$}O(\backslashsqrt{\{}k{\}}){\$}-times leads to the (currently) fastest deterministic algorithm, called Repeated Greedy, for maximizing a general submodular function subject to {\$}k{\$}-independent system constraints. Repeated Greedy achieves {\$}(1 + O(1/\backslashsqrt{\{}k{\}}))k{\$} approximation using {\$}O(nr\backslashsqrt{\{}k{\}}){\$} function evaluations (here, {\$}n{\$} and {\$}r{\$} denote the size of the ground set and the maximum size of a feasible solution, respectively). We then show that by a careful sampling procedure, we can run the greedy algorithm only once and obtain the (currently) fastest randomized algorithm, called Sample Greedy, for maximizing a submodular function subject to {\$}k{\$}-extendible system constraints (a subclass of {\$}k{\$}-independent system constrains). Sample Greedy achieves {\$}(k + 3){\$}-approximation with only {\$}O(nr/k){\$} function evaluations. Finally, we derive an almost matching lower bound, and show that no polynomial time algorithm can have an approximation ratio smaller than {\$} k + 1/2 - \backslashvarepsilon{\$}. To further support our theoretical results, we compare the performance of Repeated Greedy and Sample Greedy with prior art in a concrete application (movie recommendation). We consistently observe that while Sample Greedy achieves practically the same utility as the best baseline, it performs at least two orders of magnitude faster.},

abstract = {In this paper we analyze the robustness of stochastic variants of the greedy algorithm for submodular maximization. Our main result shows that for maximizing a monotone submodular function under a cardinality constraint, iteratively selecting an element whose marginal contribution is approximately maximal in expectation is a sufficient condition to obtain the optimal approximation guarantee with exponentially high probability, assuming the cardinality is sufficiently large. One consequence of our result is that the linear-time STOCHASTIC-GREEDY algorithm recently proposed in (Mirzasoleiman et al.,2015) achieves the optimal running time while maintaining an optimal approximation guarantee. We also show that high probability guarantees cannot be obtained for stochastic greedy algorithms under matroid constraints, and prove an approximation guarantee which holds in expectation. In contrast to the guarantees of the greedy algorithm, we show that the approximation ratio of stochastic local search is arbitrarily bad, with high probability, as well as in expectation.},

abstract = {Fast algorithms for submodular maximization problems have a vast potential use in applicative settings, such as machine learning, social networks, and economics. Though fast algorithms were known for some special cases, only recently Badanidiyuru and Vondr$\backslash$'{\{}a{\}}k (2014) were the first to explicitly look for such algorithms in the general case of maximizing a monotone submodular function subject to a matroid independence constraint. The algorithm of Badanidiyuru and Vondr$\backslash$'{\{}a{\}}k matches the best possible approximation guarantee, while trying to reduce the number of value oracle queries the algorithm performs. Our main result is a new algorithm for this general case which establishes a surprising tradeoff between two seemingly unrelated quantities: the number of value oracle queries and the number of matroid independence queries performed by the algorithm. Specifically, one can decrease the former by increasing the latter and vice versa, while maintaining the best possible approximation guarantee. Such a tradeoff is very useful since various applications might incur significantly different costs in querying the value and matroid independence oracles. Furthermore, in case the rank of the matroid is {\$}O(n{\^{}}c){\$}, where {\$}n{\$} is the size of the ground set and {\$}c{\$} is an absolute constant smaller than {\$}1{\$}, the total number of oracle queries our algorithm uses can be made to have a smaller magnitude compared to that needed by Badanidiyuru and Vondr$\backslash$'{\{}a{\}}k. We also provide even faster algorithms for the well studied special cases of a cardinality constraint and a partition matroid independence constraint, both of which capture many real-world applications and have been widely studied both theorically and in practice.},

abstract = {The de Bruijn graph {\$}G{\_}K{\$} of a set of strings {\$}S{\$} is a key data structure in genome assembly that represents overlaps between all the {\$}K{\$}-length substrings of {\$}S{\$}. Construction and navigation of the graph is a space and time bottleneck in practice and the main hurdle for assembling large, eukaryote genomes. This problem is compounded by the fact that state-of-the-art assemblers do not build the de Bruijn graph for a single order (value of {\$}K{\$}) but for multiple values of {\$}K{\$}. More precisely, they build {\$}d{\$} de Bruijn graphs, each with a specific order, i.e., {\$}G{\_}{\{}K{\_}1{\}}, G{\_}{\{}K{\_}2{\}}, ..., G{\_}{\{}K{\_}d{\}}{\$}. Although, this paradigm increases the quality of the assembly produced, it increases the memory by a factor of {\$}d{\$} in most cases. In this paper, we show how to augment a succinct de Bruijn graph representation by Bowe et al. (Proc. WABI, 2012) to support new operations that let us change order on the fly, effectively representing all de Bruijn graphs of order up to some maximum {\$}K{\$} in a single data structure. Our experiments show our variable-order de Bruijn graph only modestly increases space usage, construction time, and navigation time compared to a single order graph.},

abstract = {Constrained submodular maximization problems have long been studied, with near-optimal results known under a variety of constraints when the submodular function is monotone. The case of non-monotone submodular maximization is less understood: the first approximation algorithms even for the unconstrainted setting were given by Feige et al. (FOCS '07). More recently, Lee et al. (STOC '09, APPROX '09) show how to approximately maximize non-monotone submodular functions when the constraints are given by the intersection of p matroid constraints; their algorithm is based on local-search procedures that consider p-swaps, and hence the running time may be n{\^{}}Omega(p), implying their algorithm is polynomial-time only for constantly many matroids. In this paper, we give algorithms that work for p-independence systems (which generalize constraints given by the intersection of p matroids), where the running time is poly(n,p). Our algorithm essentially reduces the non-monotone maximization problem to multiple runs of the greedy algorithm previously used in the monotone case. Our idea of using existing algorithms for monotone functions to solve the non-monotone case also works for maximizing a submodular function with respect to a knapsack constraint: we get a simple greedy-based constant-factor approximation for this problem. With these simpler algorithms, we are able to adapt our approach to constrained non-monotone submodular maximization to the (online) secretary setting, where elements arrive one at a time in random order, and the algorithm must make irrevocable decisions about whether or not to select each element as it arrives. We give constant approximations in this secretary setting when the algorithm is constrained subject to a uniform matroid or a partition matroid, and give an O(log k) approximation when it is constrained by a general matroid of rank k.},

abstract = {For the problem maxlcub;Z(S): S is an independent set in the matroid Xrcub;, it is well-known that the greedy algorithm finds an optimal solution when Z is an additive set function (Rado-Edmonds theorem). Fisher, Nemhauser and Wolsey have shown that, when Z is a nondecreasing submodular set function satisfying Z(???)=0, the greedy algorithm finds a solution with value at least half the optimum value. In this paper we show that it finds a solution with value at least 1/(1 + ??) times the optimum value, where ?? is a parameter which represents the 'total curvature' of Z. This parameter satisfies 0????????1 and ??=0 if and only if the set function Z is additive. Thus the theorems of Rado-Edmonds and Fisher-Nemhauser-Wolsey are both contained in the bound 1/(1 + ??). We show that this bound is best possible in terms of ??. Another bound which generalizes the Rado-Edmonds theorem is given in terms of a 'greedy curvature' of the set function. Unlike the first bound, this bound can prove the optimality of the greedy algorithm even in instances where Z is not additive. A third bound, in terms of the rank and the girth of X, unifies and generalizes the bounds (e-1)/e known for uniform matroids and 1 2 for general matroids. We also analyze the performance of the greedy algorithm when X is an independence system instead of a matroid. Then we derive two bounds, both tight: The first one is [1-(1-??/K)k]/?? where K and k are the sizes of the largest and smallest maximal independent sets in X respectively; the second one is 1/(p+??) where p is the minimum number of matroids that must be intersected to obtain X. ?? 1984.},

abstract = {The study of combinatorial optimization problems with a submodular objective has attracted much attention in recent years. Such problems are important in both theory and practice because their objective functions are very general. Obtaining further improvements for many submodular maximization problems boils down to finding better algorithms for optimizing a relaxation of them known as the multilinear extension. In this work we present an algorithm for optimizing the multilinear relaxation whose guarantee improves over the guarantee of the best previous algorithm (which was given by Ene and Nguyen (2016)). Moreover, our algorithm is based on a new technique which is, arguably, simpler and more natural for the problem at hand. In a nutshell, previous algorithms for this problem rely on symmetry properties which are natural only in the absence of a constraint. Our technique avoids the need to resort to such properties, and thus, seems to be a better fit for constrained problems.},
