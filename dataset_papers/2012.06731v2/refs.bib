@article{Yin2019,
abstract = {Training activation quantized neural networks involves minimizing a piecewise constant function whose gradient vanishes almost everywhere, which is undesirable for the standard back-propagation or chain rule. An empirical way around this issue is to use a straight-through estimator (STE) (Bengio et al., 2013) in the backward pass only, so that the "gradient" through the modified chain rule becomes non-trivial. Since this unusual "gradient" is certainly not the gradient of loss function, the following question arises: why searching in its negative direction minimizes the training loss? In this paper, we provide the theoretical justification of the concept of STE by answering this question. We consider the problem of learning a two-linear-layer network with binarized ReLU activation and Gaussian input data. We shall refer to the unusual "gradient" given by the STE-modifed chain rule as coarse gradient. The choice of STE is not unique. We prove that if the STE is properly chosen, the expected coarse gradient correlates positively with the population gradient (not available for the training), and its negation is a descent direction for minimizing the population loss. We further show the associated coarse gradient descent algorithm converges to a critical point of the population loss minimization problem. Moreover, we show that a poor choice of STE leads to instability of the training algorithm near certain local minima, which is verified with CIFAR-10 experiments.},

@article{Chen2009,
abstract = {Learning to rank has become an important research topic in machine learning. While most learning-to-rank methods learn the ranking functions by minimizing loss functions, it is the ranking measures (such as NDCG and MAP) that are used to evaluate the performance of the learned ranking functions. In this work, we reveal the relationship between ranking measures and loss functions in learningto-rank methods, such as Ranking SVM, RankBoost, RankNet, and ListMLE. We show that the loss functions of these methods are upper bounds of the measurebased ranking errors. As a result, the minimization of these loss functions will lead to the maximization of the ranking measures. The key to obtaining this result is to model ranking as a sequence of classification tasks, and define a so-called essential loss for ranking as the weighted sum of the classification errors of individual tasks in the sequence. We have proved that the essential loss is both an upper bound of the measure-based ranking errors, and a lower bound of the loss functions in the aforementioned methods. Our proof technique also suggests a way to modify existing loss functions to make them tighter bounds of the measure-based ranking errors. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that the modifications can lead to better ranking performances, demonstrating the correctness of our theoretical analysis.},

abstract = {Learning a similarity function between pairs of objects is at the core of learning to rank approaches. In information retrieval tasks we typically deal with query-document pairs, in question answering – question-answer pairs. However, before learning can take place, such pairs needs to be mapped from the original space of symbolic words into some feature space encoding various aspects of their relatedness, e.g. lexical, syntactic and semantic. Feature engineer-ing is often a laborious task and may require external knowledge sources that are not always available or difficult to obtain. Recently, deep learning approaches have gained a lot of attention from the research community and industry for their ability to automatically learn optimal feature representation for a given task, while claim-ing state-of-the-art performance in many tasks in computer vision, speech recognition and natural language processing. In this paper, we present a convolutional neural network architecture for rerank-ing pairs of short texts, where we learn the optimal representation of text pairs and a similarity function to relate them in a supervised way from the available training data. Our network takes only words in the input, thus requiring minimal preprocessing. In particular, we consider the task of reranking short text pairs where elements of the pair are sentences. We test our deep learning system on two popular retrieval tasks from TREC: Question Answering and Mi-croblog Retrieval. Our model demonstrates strong performance on the first task beating previous state-of-the-art systems by about 3{\%} absolute points in both MAP and MRR and shows comparable re-sults on tweet reranking, while enjoying the benefits of no manual feature engineering and no additional syntactic parsers.},

abstract = {The current trend in social media analysis and application is to use the pre-defined features and devoted to the later model development modules to meet the end tasks. Representation learning has been a fundamental problem in machine learning, and widely recognized as critical to the performance of end tasks. In this paper, we provide evidence that specially learned features will addresses the diverse, heterogeneous, and collective characteristics of social media data. Therefore, we propose to transfer the focus from the model development to latent feature learning, and present a unified framework of latent feature learning on social media. To address the noisy, diverse, heterogeneous, and interconnected characteristics of social media data, the popular deep learning is employed due to its excellent abstract abilities. In particular, we instantiate the proposed framework by (1) designing a novel relational generative deep learning model to solve the social media link analysis task, and (2) developing a multimodal deep learning to lambda rank model towards the social image retrieval task. We show that the derived latent features lead to improvement in both of the social media tasks.},

However, a few researchers introduce the topic into visual reranking due to the special nature of image presentation. In this paper, a novel unsupervised visual reranking is proposed, termed rank via the convolutional neural networks (RankCNN). This approach integrates deep learning with pseudo preference feedback. The optimal set of pseudo preference pairs is first detected from initial list by a modified graph-based method. Ranking is then reduced to pairwise classification in the architecture of CNN. In addition, Accelerated Mini-Batch Stochastic Dual Coordinate Ascent (ASDCA) is introduced to the framework to accelerate the training. The experiments indicate the competitive performance on the LETOR 4.0, the Paris and the Francelandmark dataset. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

This enables us to draw on word-level to sentence-level supervisions derived from refer- ence summaries. In addition, recursive neural networks are used to automatically learn ranking features over the tree, with hand-crafted feature vectors of words as inputs. Hier- archical regressions are then conducted with learned features concatenating raw features. Ranking scores of sentences and words are utilized to effectively select informative and non- redundant sentences to generate summaries. Experiments on the DUC 2001, 2002 and 2004 multi-document summariza- tion datasets show that R2N2 outperforms state-of-the-art ex- tractive summarization approaches. Introduction},

abstract = {Learning to rank is a supervised learning problem where the output space is the space of rankings but the supervision space is the space of relevance scores. We make theoretical contributions to the learning to rank problem both in the online and batch settings. First, we propose a perceptron-like algorithm for learning a ranking function in an online setting. Our algorithm is an extension of the classic perceptron algorithm for the classification problem. Second, in the setting of batch learning, we introduce a sufficient condition for convex ranking surrogates to ensure a generalization bound that is independent of number of objects per query. Our bound holds when linear ranking functions are used: a common practice in many learning to rank algorithms. En route to developing the online algorithm and generalization bound, we propose a novel family of listwise large margin ranking surrogates. Our novel surrogate family is obtained by modifying a well-known pairwise large margin ranking surrogate and is distinct from the listwise large margin surrogates developed using the structured prediction framework. Using the proposed family, we provide a guaranteed upper bound on the cumulative NDCG (or MAP) induced loss under the perceptron-like algorithm. We also show that the novel surrogates satisfy the generalization bound condition.},

Compared to shallow systems, these feature layers are learnt for the task of interest, and do not require any engineering.

We will study multi-tasking different tasks, new semi-supervised learning techniques adapted to these deep architectures, and review end-to-end structured output learning.

abstract = {With the rapid growth of web images, hashing has received increasing interests in large scale image retrieval. Research efforts have been devoted to learning compact binary codes that preserve semantic similarity based on labels. However, most of these hashing methods are designed to handle simple binary similarity. The complex multilevel semantic structure of images associated with multiple labels have not yet been well explored. Here we propose a deep semantic ranking based method for learning hash functions that preserve multilevel semantic similarity between multi-label images. In our approach, deep convolutional neural network is incorporated into hash functions to jointly learn feature representations and mappings from them to hash codes, which avoids the limitation of semantic representation power of hand-crafted features. Meanwhile, a ranking list that encodes the multilevel similarity information is employed to guide the learning of such deep hash functions. An effective scheme based on surrogate loss is used to solve the intractable optimization problem of nonsmooth and multivariate ranking measures involved in the learning procedure. Experimental results show the superiority of our proposed approach over several state-of-the-art hashing methods in term of ranking evaluation metrics when tested on multi-label image datasets.},

abstract = {Learning to rank has become an important research topic in machine learning. While most learning-to-rank methods learn the ranking functions by minimizing loss functions, it is the ranking measures (such as NDCG and MAP) that are used to evaluate the performance of the learned ranking functions. In this work, we reveal the relationship between ranking measures and loss functions in learningto-rank methods, such as Ranking SVM, RankBoost, RankNet, and ListMLE. We show that the loss functions of these methods are upper bounds of the measurebased ranking errors. As a result, the minimization of these loss functions will lead to the maximization of the ranking measures. The key to obtaining this result is to model ranking as a sequence of classification tasks, and define a so-called essential loss for ranking as the weighted sum of the classification errors of individual tasks in the sequence. We have proved that the essential loss is both an upper bound of the measure-based ranking errors, and a lower bound of the loss functions in the aforementioned methods. Our proof technique also suggests a way to modify existing loss functions to make them tighter bounds of the measure-based ranking errors. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that the modifications can lead to better ranking performances, demonstrating the correctness of our theoretical analysis.},

abstract = {E-Commerce (E-Com) search is an emerging important new application of information retrieval. Learning to Rank (LETOR) is a general effective strategy for optimizing search engines, and is thus also a key technology for E-Com search. While the use of LETOR for web search has been well studied, its use for E-Com search has not yet been well explored. In this paper, we discuss the practical challenges in applying learning to rank methods to E-Com search, including the challenges in feature representation, obtaining reliable relevance judgments, and optimally exploiting multiple user feedback signals such as click rates, add-to-cart ratios, order rates, and revenue. We study these new challenges using experiments on industry data sets and report several interesting ndings that can provide guidance on how to optimally apply LETOR to E-Com search: First, popularity-based features defined solely on product items are very useful and LETOR methods were able to effectively optimize their combination with relevance-based features. Second, query attribute sparsity raises challenges for LETOR, and selecting features to reduce/avoid sparsity is beneficial. Third, while crowdsourcing is often useful for obtaining relevance judgments for Web search, it does not work as well for E-Com search due to difficulty in eliciting sufficiently fine grained relevance judgments. Finally, among the multiple feedback signals, the order rate is found to be the most robust training objective, followed by click rate, while add-to-cart ratio seems least robust, suggesting that an effective practical strategy may be to initially use click rates for training and gradually shift to using order rates as they become available.},

We propose a new class of smoothing transformations based on a mixture of two overlapping distributions, and show that the proposed transformation can be used for training binary latent models with either directed or undirected priors. We derive a new variational bound to efficiently train with Boltzmann machine priors. Using this bound, we develop DVAE++, a generative model with a global discrete prior and a hierarchy of convo-lutional continuous variables. Experiments on several benchmarks show that overlapping transformations outperform other recent continuous relaxations of discrete latent variables including Gumbel-Softmax (Maddison et al., 2016; Jang et al., 2016), and discrete variational autoencoders (Rolfe, 2016).

We present a novel method to train a class of probabilistic models with discrete latent variables using the variational autoencoder framework, including backpropagation through the discrete latent variables. The associated class of probabilistic models comprises an undirected discrete component and a directed hierarchical continuous component. The discrete component captures the distribution over the disconnected smooth manifolds induced by the continuous component. As a result, this class of models efficiently learns both the class of objects in an image, and their specific realization in pixels, from unsupervised data; and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the permutation-invariant MNIST, Omniglot, and Caltech-101 Silhouettes datasets.},

Currently, existing information retrieval measures are impossible to optimize directly except for models with a very small number of parameters. The IR community thus faces a major challenge: how to optimize IR measures of interest directly. In this paper, we present a solution. Specifically, we show that LambdaRank, which smoothly approximates the gradient of the target measure, can be adapted to work with four popular IR target evaluation measures using the same underlying gradient construction. It is likely, therefore, that this construction is extendable to other evaluation measures. We empirically show that LambdaRank finds a locally optimal solution for mean NDCG@10, mean NDCG, MAP and MRR with a 99{\%} confidence rate. We also show that the amount of effective training data varies with IR measure and that with a sufficiently large training set size, matching the training optimization measure to the target evaluation measure yields the best accuracy.

abstract = {Graphical Model (GM) has provided a popular framework for big data analytics because it often lends itself to distributed and parallel processing by utilizing graph-based 'local' structures. It models correlated random variables where in particular, the max-product Belief Propagation (BP) is the most popular heuristic to compute the most-likely assignment in GMs. In the past years, it has been proven that BP can solve a few classes of combinatorial optimization problems under certain conditions. Motivated by this, we explore the prospect of using BP to solve generic combinatorial optimization problems. The challenge is that, in practice, BP may converge very slowly and even if it does converge, the BP decision often violates the constraints of the original problem. This paper proposes a generic framework that enables us to apply BP-based algorithms to compute an approximate feasible solution for an arbitrary combinatorial optimization task. The main novel ingredients include (a) careful initialization of BP messages, (b) hybrid damping on BP updates, and (c) post-processing using BP beliefs. Utilizing the framework, we develop parallel algorithms for several large-scale combinatorial optimization problems including maximum weight matching, vertex cover and independent set. We demonstrate that our framework delivers high approximation ratio, speeds up the process by parallelization, and allows large-scale processing involving billions of variables.},

However, there has been a growing understanding that the latter is important to consider for a wide range of ranking applications (e.g. online marketplaces, job placement, admissions). To address this need, we propose a general LTR framework that can optimize a wide range of utility metrics (e.g. NDCG) while satisfying fairness of exposure constraints with respect to the items. This framework expands the class of learnable ranking functions to stochastic ranking policies, which provides a language for rigorously expressing fairness specifications. Furthermore, we provide a new LTR algorithm called Fair-PG-Rank for directly searching the space of fair ranking policies via a policy-gradient approach. Beyond the theoretical evidence in deriving the framework and the algorithm, we provide empirical results on simulated and real-world datasets verifying the effectiveness of the approach in individual and group-fairness settings.},

abstract = {A central problem in ranking is to design a measure for evaluation of ranking functions. In this paper we study, from a theoretical perspective, the Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) which is a family of ranking measures widely used in practice. Although there are extensive empirical studies of the NDCG family, little is known about its theoretical properties. We first show that, whatever the ranking function is, the standard NDCG which adopts a logarithmic discount, converges to 1 as the number of items to rank goes to infinity. On the first sight, this result seems to imply that the standard NDCG cannot differentiate good and bad ranking functions on large datasets, contradicting to its empirical success in many applications. In order to have a deeper understanding of the general NDCG ranking measures, we propose a notion referred to as consistent distin-guishability. This notion captures the intuition that a ranking measure should have such a property: For every pair of substantially different ranking functions, the ranking measure can decide which one is better in a consistent manner on almost all datasets. We show that standard NDCG has consistent distinguishability although it converges to the same limit for all ranking functions. We next characterize the set of all feasible discount functions for NDCG according to the concept of consistent distinguishability. Specifically we show that whether an NDCG measure has consistent distinguishability depends on how fast the discount decays; and r-1 is a critical point. We then turn to the cut-off version of NDCG, i.e., NDCG@k. We analyze the distinguishability of NDCG@k for various choices of k and the discount functions. Experimental results on real Web search datasets agree well with the theory. {\textcopyright} 2013 Y. Wang, L. Wang, Y. Li, D. He, W. Chen {\&} T.-Y. Liu.},

abstract = {Learning to rank has received great attention in recent years as it plays a crucial role in information retrieval. The existing concept of learning to rank assumes that each training sample is associated with an instance and a reliable label. However, in practice, this assumption does not necessarily hold true. This study focuses on the learning to rank when each training instance is labeled by multiple annotators that may be unreliable. In such a scenario, no accurate labels can be obtained. This study proposes two learning approaches. One is to simply estimate the ground truth first and then to learn a ranking model with it. The second approach is a maximum likelihood learning approach which estimates the ground truth and learns the ranking model iteratively. The two approaches have been tested on both synthetic and real-world data. The results reveal that the maximum likelihood approach outperforms the first approach significantly and is comparable of achieving results with the learning model considering reliable labels. Further more, both the approaches have been applied for ranking the Web visual clutter.},

abstract = {We propose Top-N-Rank, a novel family of list-wise Learning-to-Rank models for reliably recommending the N top-ranked items. The proposed models optimize a variant of the widely used cumulative discounted gain (DCG) objective function which differs from DCG in two important aspects: (i) It limits the evaluation of DCG only on the top N items in the ranked lists, thereby eliminating the impact of low-ranked items on the learned ranking function; and (ii) it incorporates weights that allow the model to leverage multiple types of implicit feedback with differing levels of reliability or trustworthiness. Because the resulting objective function is non-smooth and hence challenging to optimize, we consider two smooth approximations of the objective function, using the traditional sigmoid function and the rectified linear unit (ReLU). We propose a family of learning-to-rank algorithms (Top-N-Rank) that work with any smooth objective function. Then, a more efficient variant, Top-N-Rank.ReLU, is introduced, which effectively exploits the properties of ReLU function to reduce the computational complexity of Top-N-Rank from quadratic to linear in the average number of items rated by users. The results of our experiments using two widely used benchmarks, namely, the MovieLens data set and the Amazon Video Games data set demonstrate that: (i) The »top-N truncation» of the objective function substantially improves the ranking quality of the top N recommendations; (ii) using the ReLU for smoothing the objective function yields significant improvement in both ranking quality as well as runtime as compared to using the sigmoid; and (iii) Top-N-Rank.ReLU substantially outperforms the well-performing list-wise ranking methods in terms of ranking quality.},

abstract = {How to optimize ranking metrics such as Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) is an important but challenging problem, because ranking metrics are either flat or discontinuous everywhere, which makes them hard to be optimized directly. Among existing approaches, LambdaRank is a novel algorithm that incorporates ranking metrics into its learning procedure. Though empirically effective, it still lacks theoretical justification. For example, the underlying loss that LambdaRank optimizes for remains unknown until now. Due to this, there is no principled way to advance the LambdaRank algorithm further. In this paper, we present LambdaLoss, a probabilistic framework for ranking metric optimization. We show that LambdaRank is a special configuration with a well-defined loss in the LambdaLoss framework, and thus provide theoretical justification for it. More importantly, the LambdaLoss framework allows us to define metric-driven loss functions that have clear connection to different ranking metrics. We show a few cases in this paper and evaluate them on three publicly available data sets. Experimental results show that our metric-driven loss functions can significantly improve the state-of-the-art learning-to-rank algorithms.},

abstract = {In learning-to-rank for information retrieval, a ranking model is automatically learned from the data and then utilized to rank the sets of retrieved documents. Therefore, an ideal ranking model would be a mapping from a document set to a permutation on the set, and should satisfy two critical requirements: (1){\~{}}it should have the ability to model cross-document interactions so as to capture local context information in a query; (2){\~{}}it should be permutation-invariant, which means that any permutation of the inputted documents would not change the output ranking. Previous studies on learning-to-rank either design uni-variate scoring functions that score each document separately, and thus failed to model the cross-document interactions; or construct multivariate scoring functions that score documents sequentially, which inevitably sacrifice the permutation invariance requirement. In this paper, we propose a neural learning-to-rank model called SetRank which directly learns a permutation-invariant ranking model defined on document sets of any size. SetRank employs a stack of (induced) multi-head self attention blocks as its key component for learning the embeddings for all of the retrieved documents jointly. The self-attention mechanism not only helps SetRank to capture the local context information from cross-document interactions, but also to learn permutation-equivariant representations for the inputted documents, which therefore achieving a permutation-invariant ranking model. Experimental results on three large scale benchmarks showed that the SetRank significantly outperformed the baselines include the traditional learning-to-rank models and state-of-the-art Neural IR models.},

@article{Weston2013,
abstract = {We consider the case of ranking a very large set of labels, items, or documents, which is common to information retrieval, recommendation, and large-scale annotation tasks. We present a general approach for converting an algorithm which has linear time in the size of the set to a sublinear one via label partitioning. Our method consists of learning an input partition and a label assignment to each partition of the space such that precision at k is optimized, which is the loss function of interest in this setting. Experiments on large-scale ranking and recommendation tasks show that our method not only makes the original linear time algorithm computationally tractable, but can also improve its performance.
