Recent studies have discovered that Chain-of-Thought prompting (CoT) can
dramatically improve the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs),
particularly when dealing with complex tasks involving mathematics or
reasoning. Despite the enormous empirical success, the underlying mechanisms
behind CoT and how it unlocks the potential of LLMs remain elusive. In this
paper, we take a first step towards theoretically answering these questions.
Specifically, we examine the expressivity of LLMs with CoT in solving
fundamental mathematical and decision-making problems. By using circuit
complexity theory, we first give impossibility results showing that
bounded-depth Transformers are unable to directly produce correct answers for
basic arithmetic/equation tasks unless the model size grows super-polynomially
with respect to the input length. In contrast, we then prove by construction
that autoregressive Transformers of constant size suffice to solve both tasks
by generating CoT derivations using a commonly used math language format.
Moreover, we show LLMs with CoT can handle a general class of decision-making
problems known as Dynamic Programming, thus justifying its power in tackling
complex real-world tasks. Finally, an extensive set of experiments show that,
while Transformers always fail to directly predict the answers, they can
consistently learn to generate correct solutions step-by-step given sufficient
CoT demonstrations.
