  abstract = 	 {Aerodynamic shape optimization has many industrial applications. Existing methods, however, are so computationally demanding that typical engineering practices are to either simply try a limited number of hand-designed shapes or restrict oneself to shapes that can be parameterized using only few degrees of freedom. In this work, we introduce a new way to optimize complex shapes fast and accurately. To this end, we train Geodesic Convolutional Neural Networks to emulate a fluidynamics simulator. The key to making this approach practical is remeshing the original shape using a poly-cube map, which makes it possible to perform the computations on GPUs instead of CPUs. The neural net is then used to formulate an objective function that is differentiable with respect to the shape parameters, which can then be optimized using a gradient-based technique. This outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 5 to 20% for standard problems and, even more importantly, our approach applies to cases that previous methods cannot handle.}

   abstract = {We present a data-driven technique to instantly predict how fluid flows around various three-dimensional objects. Such simulation is useful for computational fabrication and engineering, but is usually computationally expensive since it requires solving the Navier-Stokes equation for many time steps. To accelerate the process, we propose a machine learning framework which predicts aerodynamic forces and velocity and pressure fields given a threedimensional shape input. Handling detailed free-form three-dimensional shapes in a data-driven framework is challenging because machine learning approaches usually require a consistent parametrization of input and output. We present a novel PolyCube maps-based parametrization that can be computed for three-dimensional shapes at interactive rates. This allows us to efficiently learn the nonlinear response of the flow using a Gaussian process regression. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for the interactive design and optimization of a car body.},

   abstract = {In aerodynamics related design, analysis and optimization problems, flow fields are simulated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers. However, CFD simulation is usually a computationally expensive, memory demanding and time consuming iterative process. These drawbacks of CFD limit opportunities for design space exploration and forbid interactive design. We propose a general and flexible approximation model for real-time prediction of non-uniform steady laminar flow in a 2D or 3D domain based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We explored alternatives for the geometry representation and the network architecture of CNNs. We show that convolutional neural networks can estimate the velocity field two orders of magnitude faster than a GPU-accelerated CFD solver and four orders of magnitude faster than a CPU-based CFD solver at a cost of a low error rate. This approach can provide immediate feedback for real-time design iterations at the early stage of design. Compared with existing approximation models in the aerodynamics domain, CNNs enable an efficient estimation for the entire velocity field. Furthermore, designers and engineers can directly apply the CNN approximation model in their design space exploration algorithms without training extra lower-dimensional surrogate models.},

@inproceedings{Rios2020_Back2Meshes,
   abstract = {Point cloud autoencoders were recently introduced as powerful models for data compression. They learn a lowdimensional set of variables that are suitable as design parameters for shape generation and optimization problems. In engineering tasks, 3D point clouds are often derived from fine polygon meshes, which are the most suitable representations for physics simulation, e.g., computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Yet, the reconstruction of high-quality meshes from autoencoderbased point clouds is challenging, often requiring supervised and manual work, which is prohibitive during the optimization. Target shape matching optimization using existing mesh prototypes overcomes the difficulties of recovering shape information from the point coordinates. However, for autoencoders trained on data sets comprising shapes with high degree of dissimilarity, there is not a single mesh prototype that can fit any autoencoderbased point cloud, and the selection of a set of prototypes is nontrivial. In the present paper we propose a method for optimizing a selection of prototypical meshes to match the maximum number of shapes in the autoencoder output space as possible, which is achieved by linking the advantages of the latent space representation of an autoencoder and the state-of-the-art free form deformation (FFD) method. Furthermore, we approached the balance between costs (number of mesh prototypes) and number of covered shapes by varying the number of prototypes and the dimensionality of the autoencoder latent space, showing that higher-dimensional latent spaces encode finer geometric changes, requiring more sophisticated FFD setups.},

@article{Gunpinar2019,
   abstract = {A design support system is developed in this work that can be integrated into the car side silhouette design tools and can estimate the drag coefficient of a given silhouette. This task is typically performed via two manners: namely wind tunnel testing and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. Due to the high computational cost for these two approaches, it is impractical to employ them during the silhouette conceptual design stage in a real time. Therefore, a mathematical model is obtained in this study for the drag coefficient estimation of a given silhouette. First, the desired number of silhouettes are generated via a generative design (silhouette sampling) technique so that the silhouettes are evenly distributed in the silhouette design space. Each silhouette is then tested via computational fluid dynamics simulations, and their corresponding drag coefficients (C D s) are obtained. A training dataset is formed with the silhouette geometries and C D s of the silhouettes, and a mathematical model that can estimate the drag coefficient (C D ) of a silhouette is finally obtained via principal component analysis (PCA) followed by regression/neural network methods. These three steps are repeated until a desired level of reliable mathematical model is obtained. Finally, three generative design test cases are illustrated based on the mathematical model obtained to predict C D of a given silhouette.},

   abstract = {Flow fields, including velocity and pressure fields, are typically used as references for vehicle shape design in the automotive industry to ensure steering stability and energy conservation. Generally, flow fields are calculated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations which is time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, a more efficient and interactive method is desired by designers for advanced shape discussion and design. To this end, we propose a fast estimation model using 3D convolutional neural networks. We employ a style extractor to obtain sufficient deep features of each vehicle shape and apply them using adaptive instance normalisation to improve the estimation performance. In addition, a proposed loss function which mainly includes a slice-weighted loss function is used to train the estimation model. The findings show that our proposed method outperforms previous studies, especially on flow field estimation in wake regions and regions near the vehicle surface. Therefore, the proposed method allows designing vehicle shapes while ensuring desirable aerodynamic performance within a much shorter period than extended CFD simulations.},

abstract={The aerodynamic optimization process of cars requires multiple iterations between aerodynamicists and stylists. Response surface modeling and reduced-order modeling (ROM) are commonly used to eliminate the overhead due to computational fluid dynamics (CFD), leading to faster iterations. However, a primary drawback of these models is that they can work only on the parameterized geometric features they were trained with. This study evaluates if deep learning models can predict the drag coefficient (cd ) for an arbitrary input geometry without explicit parameterization. We use two similar data sets (total of 1000 simulations) based on the publicly available DrivAer geometry for training. We use a modified U-Net architecture that uses signed distance fields (SDF) to represent the input geometries. Our models outperform the existing models by at least 11% in prediction accuracy for the drag coefficient. We achieved this improvement by combining multiple data sets that were created using different parameterizations, which is not possible with the methods currently used. We have also shown that it is possible to predict velocity fields and drag coefficient concurrently and that simple data augmentation methods can improve the results. In addition, we have performed an occlusion sensitivity study on our models to understand what information is used to make predictions. From the occlusion sensitivity study, we showed that the models were able to identify the geometric features and have discovered that the model has learned to exploit the global information present in the SDF. In contrast to the currently operational method, where design changes are restricted to the initially defined parameters, this study brings data-driven surrogate models one step closer to the long-term goal of having a model that can be used for approximate aerodynamic evaluation of unseen, arbitrary vehicle shapes, thereby providing complete design freedom to the vehicle stylists.}

The application of these tools to engineering design is an intriguing possibility, but is currently limited by their inability to parse and enforce concrete engineering constraints. In this paper, we take a step towards this goal by proposing physics-based guidance, which enables optimization of a performance metric (as predicted by a surrogate model) during the generation process. As a proof-of-concept, we add drag guidance to Stable Diffusion, which allows this tool to generate images of novel vehicles while simultaneously minimizing their predicted drag coefficients.},

   abstract = {In order to reduce the dimensionality of 3D point cloud representations, autoencoder architectures generate increasingly abstract, compressed features of the input data. Visualizing these features is central to understanding the learning process, however, while successful visualization techniques exist for neural networks applied to computer vision tasks, similar methods for geometric, especially non-Euclidean, input data are currently lacking. Hence, we propose a first-of-kind method to project the features learned by point cloud autoencoders onto a 3D-space augmented with color maps. Our proposal explores the properties of 1D-convolutions, used in state-of-the art point cloud autoencoder architectures to handle the input data, which leads to an intuitive interpretation of the visualized features. Furthermore, we tackle the search for relevant co-activations in the feature space by clustering the input data in the latent space, where we explore the correspondence between network features and geometric characteristics of typical shapes of the clusters. We tested our approach with experiments on a benchmark data set, and with three different configurations of a point cloud autoencoder, where we show that the features learned by the autoencoder correlate with the occupancy of the input space by the training data.},

   abstract = {In automotive digital development, 3D shape morphing techniques are used to create new designs in order to match design targets, such as aerodynamic or stylistic requirements. Control-point based shape morphing alters existing geometries either through human user interactions or through computational optimization algorithms that optimize for product performance targets. Shape morphing is typically continuous and results in potentially large data sets of time-series recordings of control point movements. In the present paper, we utilize recurrent neural networks to model such time-series recordings in order to predict future design steps based on the history of currently performed design modifications. To build a data set sufficiently large for the training of neural networks, we use target shape matching optimization as digital analogy for a human user interactive shape modification and to build data sets of control point movements in an automated fashion. Experiments show the potential of recurrent neural networks to successfully learn time-series data representing design changes and to perform single-and multi-step prediction of potential next design steps. We thus demonstrate the feasibility of recurrent neural networks for learning successful design sequences in order to predict promising next design steps in future design tasks.},

   abstract = {Recent advancements in machine learning comprise generative models such as autoencoders (AE) for learning and compressing 3D data to generate low-dimensional latent representations of 3D shapes. Learning latent representations that disentangle the underlying factors of variations in 3D shapes is an intuitive way to achieve generalization in generative models. However, it remains an open problem to learn a generative model of 3D shapes such that the latent variables are disentangled and represent different interpretable aspects of 3D shapes. In this paper, we propose Split-AE, which is an autoencoder-based architecture for partitioning the latent space into two sets, named as content and style codes. The content code represents global features of 3D shapes to differentiate between semantic categories of shapes, while style code represents distinct visual features to differentiate between shape categories having similar semantic meaning. We present qualitative and quantitative experiments to verify feature disentanglement using our Split-AE. Further, we demonstrate that, given a source shape as an initial shape and a target shape as a style reference, the trained Split-AE combines the content of a source and style of a target shape to generate a novel augmented shape, that possesses the distinct features of the target shape category yet maintains the similarity of the global features with the source shape. We conduct a qualitative study showing that the augmented shapes exhibit a realistic interpretable mixture of content and style features across different shape classes with similar semantic meaning.},

@article{Rios2022,
   abstract = {The choice of design representations, as of search operators, is central to the performance of evolutionary optimization algorithms, in particular, for multitask problems. The multitask approach pushes further the parallelization aspect of these algorithms by solving simultaneously multiple optimization tasks using a single population. During the search, the operators implicitly transfer knowledge between solutions to the offspring, taking advantage of potential synergies between problems to drive the solutions to optimality. Nevertheless, in order to operate on the individuals, the design space of each task has to be mapped to a common search space, which is challenging in engineering cases without clear semantic overlap between parameters. Here, we apply a 3-D point cloud autoencoder to map the representations from the Cartesian to a unified design representation: the latent space of the autoencoder. The transfer of latent space features between design representations allows the reconstruction of shapes with interpolated characteristics and maintenance of common parts, which potentially improves the performance of the designs in one or more tasks during the optimization. Compared to traditional representations for shape optimization, such as free-form deformation, the latent representation enables more representative design modifications, while keeping the baseline characteristics of the learned classes of objects. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach in an optimization scenario where we minimize the aerodynamic drag of two different car shapes with common underbodies for cost-efficient vehicle platform design.},

   abstract = {The current advances in generative AI for learning large neural network models with the capability to produce essays, images, music and even 3D assets from text prompts create opportunities for a manifold of disciplines. In the present paper, we study the potential of deep text-to-3D models in the engineering domain, with focus on the chances and challenges when integrating and interacting with 3D assets in computational simulation-based design optimization. In contrast to traditional design optimization of 3D geometries that often searches for the optimum designs using numerical representations, such as B-Spline surface or deformation parameters in vehicle aerodynamic optimization, natural language challenges the optimization framework by requiring a different interpretation of variation operators while at the same time may ease and motivate the human user interaction. Here, we propose and realize a fully automated evolutionary design optimization framework using Shap-E, a recently published text-to-3D asset network by OpenAI, in the context of aerodynamic vehicle optimization. For representing text prompts in the evolutionary optimization, we evaluate (a) a bag-of-words approach based on prompt templates and Wordnet samples, and (b) a tokenisation approach based on prompt templates and the byte pair encoding method from GPT4. Our main findings from the optimizations indicate that, first, it is important to ensure that the designs generated from prompts are within the object class of application, i.e. diverse and novel designs need to be realistic, and, second, that more research is required to develop methods where the strength of text prompt variations and the resulting variations of the 3D designs share causal relations to some degree to improve the optimization.},

The current study leverages gradient-enriched machine learning control (Cornejo Maceda et al. in J Fluid Mech 917:A42, 2021) to identify optimal control laws under unsteady conditions. The approach is exemplified on a coupled oscillator system with unsteady coupling and demonstrated for a generic truck model undergoing a yawing maneuver. Key enablers of the experiment are a rich set of pneumatic actuators and pressure sensors. The results demonstrate the method’s capabilities in identifying an efficient forcing for control under dynamically changing conditions. This automated and generalizable closed-loop control strategy complements and expands the machine learning control field and promises a new fast-track avenue to efficiently control a broader set of fluid flow problems.},

At a model length based Reynolds number of 4 . 29 million, detailed pressure measurements, wake survey and force measurements were done in a wind tunnel. Some flow visualisation results were also obtained. Geometric parameter varied was base slant angle. A drag breakdown revealed that almost 85 % of body drag is pressure drag. Most of this drag is generated at the rear end. Wake flow exhibits a triple deck system of horseshoe vortices. Strength, existence and merging of these vortices depend upon the base slant angle. Characteristic features of the wake flow for the low drag and high drag configurations is described. Relevance of these phenomena to real ground vehicle flow is addressed.},
