models, in the presence of continuous latent variables with intractable

variational inference and learning algorithm that scales to large datasets and,
under some mild differentiability conditions, even works in the intractable
case. Our contributions is two-fold. First, we show that a reparameterization
of the variational lower bound yields a lower bound estimator that can be
straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. Second,
we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent variables per

approximate inference model (also called a recognition model) to the
intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator. Theoretical
advantages are reflected in experimental results.},

However, because WaveNet relies on sequential generation of one audio sample at a time, it is poorly suited to today’s massively parallel computers, and therefore hard to deploy in a real-time production setting. This paper introduces Probability Density Distillation, a new method for training a parallel feed-forward network from a trained WaveNet with no significant difference in quality. The resulting system is capable of generating high-fidelity speech samples at more than 20 times faster than real-time, a 1000x speed up relative to the original WaveNet, and capable of serving multiple English and Japanese voices in a production setting.}

On the other hand, Bayesian methods, such as Gaussian Processes (GPs), exploit prior knowledge to quickly infer the shape of a new function at test time. Yet, GPs are computationally expensive, and it can be hard to design appropriate priors. In this paper we propose a family of neural models, Conditional Neural Processes (CNPs), that combine the benefits of both. CNPs are inspired by the flexibility of stochastic processes such as GPs, but are structured as neural networks and trained via gradient descent. CNPs make accurate predictions after observing only a handful of training data points, yet scale to complex functions and large datasets. We demonstrate the performance and versatility of the approach on a range of canonical machine learning tasks, including regression, classification and image completion.}

  abstract = 	 {Bayesian optimization is an effective methodology for the global optimization of functions with expensive evaluations. It relies on querying a distribution over functions defined by a relatively cheap surrogate model. An accurate model for this distribution over functions is critical to the effectiveness of the approach, and is typically fit using Gaussian processes (GPs). However, since GPs scale cubically with the number of observations, it has been challenging to handle objectives whose optimization requires many evaluations, and as such, massively parallelizing the optimization. In this work, we explore the use of neural networks as an alternative to GPs to model distributions over functions. We show that performing adaptive basis function regression with a neural network as the parametric form performs competitively with state-of-the-art GP-based approaches, but scales linearly with the number of data rather than cubically. This allows us to achieve a previously intractable degree of parallelism, which we apply to large scale hyperparameter optimization, rapidly finding competitive models on benchmark object recognition tasks using convolutional networks, and image caption generation using neural language models.}

We assume access to black box, stochastic “oracle" predictive functions, each of which maps from design space to a distribution over properties of interest. Because many state-of-the-art predictive models are known to suffer from pathologies, especially for data far from the training distribution, the problem becomes different from directly optimizing the oracles. Herein, we propose a method to solve this problem that uses model-based adaptive sampling to estimate a distribution over the design space, conditioned on the desired properties.}

The statistical model gives reasonable out-of-sample predictions: ±9.5 K based on root-mean-squared-error. Features extracted based on thermal conductivity, atomic radius, valence, electron affinity, and atomic mass contribute the most to the model’s predictive accuracy. It is crucial to note that our model does not predict whether a material is a superconductor or not; it only gives predictions for superconductors."

abstract={We attempt to establish geometrical methods for amino acid sequences. To measure the similarities of these sequences, a kernel on strings is defined using only the sequence structure and a good amino acid substitution matrix (e.g. BLOSUM62). The kernel is used in learning machines to predict binding affinities of peptides to human leukocyte antigen DR (HLA-DR) molecules. On both fixed allele (Nielsen and Lund in BMC Bioinform. 10:296, 2009) and pan-allele (Nielsen et al. in Immunome Res. 6(1):9, 2010) benchmark databases, our algorithm achieves the state-of-the-art performance. The kernel is also used to define a distance on an HLA-DR allele set based on which a clustering analysis precisely recovers the serotype classifications assigned by WHO (Holdsworth et al. in Tissue Antigens 73(2):95--170, 2009; Marsh et al. in Tissue Antigens 75(4):291--455, 2010). These results suggest that our kernel relates well the sequence structure of both peptides and HLA-DR molecules to their biological functions, and that it offers a simple, powerful and promising methodology to immunology and amino acid sequence studies.},
