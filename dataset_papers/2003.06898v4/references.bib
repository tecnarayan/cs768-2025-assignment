@article{lee1999learning,
    abstract = {Is perception of the whole based on perception of its parts? There is psychological1 and physiological2, 3 evidence for parts-based representations in the brain, and certain computational theories of object recognition rely on such representations4, 5. But little is known about how brains or computers might learn the parts of objects. Here we demonstrate an algorithm for non-negative matrix factorization that is able to learn parts of faces and semantic features of text. This is in contrast to other methods, such as principal components analysis and vector quantization, that learn holistic, not parts-based, representations. Non-negative matrix factorization is distinguished from the other methods by its use of non-negativity constraints. These constraints lead to a parts-based representation because they allow only additive, not subtractive, combinations. When non-negative matrix factorization is implemented as a neural network, parts-based representations emerge by virtue of two properties: the firing rates of neurons are never negative and synaptic strengths do not change sign.},

    Abstract = {The parameters of temporal models, such as dynamic Bayesian networks, may be modelled in a Bayesian context as static or atemporal variables that influence transition probabilities at every time step. Particle filters fail for models that include such variables, while methods that use Gibbs sampling of parameter variables may incur a per-sample cost that grows linearly with the length of the observation sequence. Storvik devised a method for incremental computation of exact sufficient statistics that, for some cases, reduces the per-sample cost to a constant.  In this paper, we demonstrate a connection between Storvik's filter and a Kalman filter in parameter space and establish more general conditions under which Storvik's filter works. Drawing on an analogy to the extended Kalman filter, we develop and analyze, both theoretically and experimentally, a Taylor approximation
to the parameter posterior that allows Storvik's method to be applied to a broader class of models. Our experiments on both synthetic examples and real applications show improvement over existing methods.}

  month = oct,
  abstract = {{The dramatic growth in practical applications for machine learning
	
	over the last ten years has been accompanied by many important developments
	
	in the underlying algorithms and techniques. For example, Bayesian
	
	methods have grown from a specialist niche to become mainstream,
	
	while graphical models have emerged as a general framework for describing
	
	and applying probabilistic techniques. The practical applicability
	
	of Bayesian methods has been greatly enhanced by the development
	
	of a range of approximate inference algorithms such as variational
	
	Bayes and expectation propagation, while new models based on kernels
	
	have had a significant impact on both algorithms and applications.
	
	This completely new textbook reflects these recent developments while
	
	providing a comprehensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition
	
	and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first-year
	
	PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners. No previous
	
	knowledge of pattern recognition or machine learning concepts is
	
	assumed. Familiarity with multivariate calculus and basic linear
	
	algebra is required, and some experience in the use of probabilities
	
	would be helpful though not essential as the book includes a self-contained
	
	introduction to basic probability theory. The book is suitable for
	
	courses on machine learning, statistics, computer science, signal
	
	processing, computer vision, data mining, and bioinformatics. Extensive
	
	support is provided for course instructors, including more than 400
	
	exercises, graded according to difficulty. Example solutions for
	
	a subset of the exercises are available from the book web site, while
	
	solutions for the remainder can be obtained by instructors from the
	
	publisher. The book is supported by a great deal of additional material,
	
	and the reader is encouraged to visit the book web site for the latest
	
	information. A forthcoming companion volume will deal with practical
	
	aspects of pattern recognition and machine learning, and will include
	
	free software implementations of the key algorithms along with example
	
	data sets and demonstration programs. Christopher Bishop is Assistant
	
	Director at Microsoft Research Cambridge, and also holds a Chair
	
	in Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh. He is a Fellow
	
	of Darwin College Cambridge, and was recently elected Fellow of the
	
	Royal Academy of Engineering. The author's previous textbook "Neural
	
	Networks for Pattern Recognition" has been widely adopted.}},

	arm movements. A mathematical model is formulated which is shown
	
	to predict both the qualitative features and the quantitative details
	
	observed experimentally in planar, multijoint arm movements. Coordination
	
	is modeled mathematically by defining an objective function, a measure
	
	of performance for any possible movement. The unique trajectory which
	
	yields the best performance is determined using dynamic optimization
	
	theory. In the work presented here, the objective function is the
	
	square of the magnitude of jerk (rate of change of acceleration)
	
	of the hand integrated over the entire movement. This is equivalent
	
	to assuming that a major goal of motor coordination is the production
	
	of the smoothest possible movement of the hand. Experimental observations
	
	of human subjects performing voluntary unconstrained movements in
	
	a horizontal plane are presented. They confirm the following predictions
	
	of the mathematical model: unconstrained point-to-point motions are
	
	approximately straight with bell-shaped tangential velocity profiles;
	
	curved motions (through an intermediate point or around an obstacle)
	
	have portions of low curvature joined by portions of high curvature;
	
	at points of high curvature, the tangential velocity is reduced;
	
	the durations of the low-curvature portions are approximately equal.
	
	The theoretical analysis is based solely on the kinematics of movement
	
	independent of the dynamics of the musculoskeletal system and is
	
	successful only when formulated in terms of the motion of the hand
	
	in extracorporal space. The implications with respect to movement
	
	organization are discussed.},

	The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development

	as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics.
	
	
	Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed

	in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach
	
	is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics.
	
	Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It
	
	should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested
	
	in data mining in science or industry.
	
	
	The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction)
	
	to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks,
	
	support vector machines, classification trees and boosting--the first
	
	comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book.
	
	
	Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors
	
	of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers
	
	in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive
	
	models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie wrote much
	
	of the statistical modeling software in S-PLUS and invented principal
	
	curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the Lasso and is co-author
	
	of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman
	
	is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS,
	
	and projection pursuit.
	
	
	FROM THE REVIEWS:
	
	
	TECHNOMETRICS "[This] is a vast and complex book. Generally, it concentrates
	
	on explaining why and how the methods work, rather than how to use
	
	them. Examples and especially the visualizations are principle features...As
	
	a source for the methods of statistical learning...it will probably
	
	be a long time before there is a competitor to this book."},

	and large-scale social networks generate massive amounts of data
	
	with multiple aspects and high dimensionalities. Tensors (i.e., multi-way
	
	arrays) provide a natural representation for such data. Consequently,
	
	tensor decompositions such as Tucker become important tools for summarization
	
	and analysis. One major challenge is how to deal with high-dimensional,
	
	sparse data. In other words, how do we compute decompositions of
	
	tensors where most of the entries of the tensor are zero. Specialized
	
	techniques are needed for computing the Tucker decompositions for
	
	sparse tensors because standard algorithms do not account for the
	
	sparsity of the data. As a result, a surprising phenomenon is observed
	
	by practitioners: Despite the fact that there is enough memory to
	
	store both the input tensors and the factorized output tensors, memory
	
	overflows occur during the tensor factorization process. To address
	
	this intermediate blowup problem, we propose Memory-Efficient Tucker
	
	(MET). Based on the available memory, MET adaptively selects the
	
	right execution strategy during the decomposition. We provide quantitative
	
	and qualitative evaluation of MET on real tensors. It achieves over
	
	1000X space reduction without sacrificing speed; it also allows us
	
	to work with much larger tensors that were too big to handle before.
	
	Finally, we demonstrate a data mining case-study using MET.},

	high-order and high-dimensional data, and also reveals the hidden
	
	correlations. Three variants of ITA are presented: (1) dynamic tensor

	tensor analysis (WTA). In paricular, we explore several fundamental
	
	design trade-offs such as space efficiency, computational cost, approximation
	
	accuracy, time dependency, and model complexity. We implement all
	
	our methods and apply them in several real settings, such as network
	
	anomaly detection, multiway latent semantic indexing on citation

  abstract = {In this paper, we study trajectory planning and control in voluntary,
	
	human arm movements. When a hand is moved to a target, the central
	
	nervous system must select one specific trajectory among an infinite
	
	number of possible trajectories that lead to the target position.
	
	First, we discuss what criterion is adopted for trajectory determination.
	
	Several researchers measured the hand trajectories of skilled movements
	
	and found common invariant features. For example, when moving the
	
	hand between a pair of targets, subjects tended to generate roughly
	
	straight hand paths with bell-shaped speed profiles. On the basis
	
	of these observations and dynamic optimization theory, we propose
	
	a mathematical model which accounts for formation of hand trajectories.
	
	This model is formulated by defining an objective function, a measure
	
	of performance for any possible movement: square of the rate of change
	
	of torque integrated over the entire movement. That is, the objective
	
	function CT is defined as follows: \$\$C\_T = \frac{1}{2}{}^t\int\limits\_0^f
	
	{\sum\limits\_{i = 1}^n {\left( {\frac{{{\text{d}}z\_i }}{{{\text{d}}t}}}
	
	\right)^2 {\text{d}}t,} } \$\$ where ziis the torque generated by
	
	the i-th actuator (muslce) out of n actuators, and tfis the movement
	
	time. Since this objective function critically depends on the complex
	
	nonlinear dynamics of the musculoskeletal system, it is very difficult
	
	to determine the unique trajectory which yields the best performance.
	
	We overcome this difficult by developing an iterative scheme, with
	
	which the optimal trajectory and the associated motor command are
	
	simultaneously computed. To evaluate our model, human hand trajectories
	
	were experimentally measured under various behavioral situations.
	
	These results supported the idea that the human hand trajectory is
	
	planned and controlled in accordance with the minimum torquechange
	
	criterion.},

	is a latent variable model. It comprises a low-dimensional latent
	
	space with associated dynamics, as well as a map from the latent
	
	space to an observation space. We marginalize out the model parameters
	
	in closed form by using Gaussian process priors for both the dynamical
	
	and the observation mappings. This results in a nonparametric model
	
	for dynamical systems that accounts for uncertainty in the model.
	
	We demonstrate the approach and compare four learning algorithms
	
	on human motion capture data, in which each pose is 50-dimensional.
	
	Despite the use of small data sets, the GPDM learns an effective
	
	representation of the nonlinear dynamics in these spaces.},
