	abstract = {Identification of a linear time-invariant dynamical system from partial observations is a fundamental problem in control theory. Particularly challenging are systems exhibiting long-term memory. A natural question is how learn such systems with non-asymptotic statistical rates depending on the inherent dimensionality (order) 𝑑dd of the system, rather than on the possibly much larger memory length. We propose an algorithm that given a single trajectory of length 𝑇TT with gaussian observation noise, learns the system with a near-optimal rate of 𝑂˜(𝑑𝑇‾‾√)O{\textasciitilde}(dT){\textbackslash}widetilde O{\textbackslash}left({\textbackslash}sqrt{\textbackslash}frac\{d\}\{T\}{\textbackslash}right) in 2H2{\textbackslash}mathcal\{H\}\_2 error, with only logarithmic, rather than polynomial dependence on memory length. We also give bounds under process noise and improved bounds for learning a realization of the system. Our algorithm is based on multi-scale low-rank approximation: SVD applied to Hankel matrices of geometrically increasing sizes. Our analysis relies on careful application of concentration bounds on the Fourier domain—we give sharper concentration bounds for sample covariance of correlated inputs and for ∞H∞{\textbackslash}mathcal H\_{\textbackslash}infty norm estimation, which may be of independent interest.},

	abstract = {Many problems in information processing involve some form of dimensionality reduction. Here we describe locally linear embedding (LLE), an unsupervised learning algorithm that computes low dimensional, neighborhood preserving embeddings of high dimensional data. LLE attempts to discover nonlinear structure in high dimensional data by exploiting the local symmetries of linear reconstructions. Notably, LLE maps its inputs into a single global coordinate system of lower dimensionality, and its optimizations— though capable of generating highly nonlinear embeddings—do not involve local minima. We illustrate the method on images of lips used in audiovisual speech synthesis.},

	abstract = {We study the problem of system identification and adaptive control in partially observable linear dynamical systems. Adaptive and closed-loop system identification is a challenging problem due to correlations introduced in data collection. In this paper, we present the first model estimation method with finite-time guarantees in both open and closed-loop system identification. Deploying this estimation method, we propose adaptive control online learning (AdaptOn), an efficient reinforcement learning algorithm that adaptively learns the system dynamics and continuously updates its controller through online learning steps. AdaptOn estimates the model dynamics by occasionally solving a linear regression problem through interactions with the environment. Using policy re-parameterization and the estimated model, AdaptOn constructs counterfactual loss functions to be used for updating the controller through online gradient descent. Over time, AdaptOn improves its model estimates and obtains more accurate gradient updates to improve the controller. We show that AdaptOn achieves a regret upper bound of \${\textbackslash}text\{polylog\}{\textbackslash}left(T{\textbackslash}right)\$, after \$T\$ time steps of agent-environment interaction. To the best of our knowledge, AdaptOn is the first algorithm that achieves \${\textbackslash}text\{polylog\}{\textbackslash}left(T{\textbackslash}right)\$ regret in adaptive control of unknown partially observable linear dynamical systems which includes linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control.},

	abstract = {We study the performance of the certainty equivalent controller on Linear Quadratic (LQ) control problems with unknown transition dynamics. We show that for both the fully and partially observed settings, the sub-optimality gap between the cost incurred by playing the certainty equivalent controller on the true system and the cost incurred by using the optimal LQ controller enjoys a fast statistical rate, scaling as the square of the parameter error. To the best of our knowledge, our result is the ﬁrst sub-optimality guarantee in the partially observed Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) setting. Furthermore, in the fully observed Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), our result improves upon recent work by Dean et al. [10], who present an algorithm achieving a sub-optimality gap linear in the parameter error. A key part of our analysis relies on perturbation bounds for discrete Riccati equations. We provide two new perturbation bounds, one that expands on an existing result from Konstantinov et al. [24], and another based on a new elementary proof strategy.},

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to address two related estimation problems arising in the setup of hidden state linear time invariant (LTI) state space systems when the dimension of the hidden state is unknown. Namely, the estimation of any finite number of the system's Markov parameters and the estimation of a minimal realization for the system, both from the partial observation of a single trajectory. For both problems, we provide statistical guarantees in the form of various estimation error upper bounds, \${\textbackslash}rank\$ recovery conditions, and sample complexity estimates. Specifically, we first show that the low \${\textbackslash}rank\$ solution of the Hankel penalized least square estimator satisfies an estimation error in \$S\_p\$-norms for \$p {\textbackslash}in [1,2]\$ that captures the effect of the system order better than the existing operator norm upper bound for the simple least square. We then provide a stability analysis for an estimation procedure based on a variant of the Ho-Kalman algorithm that improves both the dependence on the dimension and the least singular value of the Hankel matrix of the Markov parameters. Finally, we propose an estimation algorithm for the minimal realization that uses both the Hankel penalized least square estimator and the Ho-Kalman based estimation procedure and guarantees with high probability that we recover the correct order of the system and satisfies a new fast rate in the \$S\_2\$-norm with a polynomial reduction in the dependence on the dimension and other parameters of the problem.},

We then demonstrate that prefiltered least squares yields, to our knowledge, the first algorithm that provably estimates the parameters of partially-observed linear systems that attains rates which do not not incur a worst-case dependence on the rate at which these dependencies decay. The algorithm is provably consistent even for systems which satisfy the weaker marginal stability condition obeyed by many classical models based on Newtonian mechanics.

In particular, we focus on an intuitive cost-driven state representation learning method for solving Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control, one of the most fundamental partially observable control problems. As our main results, we establish finite-sample guarantees of finding a near-optimal state representation function and a near-optimal controller using the directly learned latent model. To the best of our knowledge, despite various empirical successes, prior to this work it was unclear if such a cost-driven latent model learner enjoys finite-sample guarantees. Our work underscores the value of predicting multi-step costs, an idea that is key to our theory, and notably also an idea that is known to be empirically valuable for learning state representations.},

This often is coupled with the missing data problem, such that only a small fraction of data attributes are observed. These complications impose significant, and unconventional, constraints on the problem of streaming principal component analysis (PCA) and subspace tracking, which is an essential building block for many inference tasks in signal processing and machine learning. This survey article reviews a variety of classical and recent algorithms for solving this problem with low computational and memory complexities, particularly those applicable in the big data regime with missing data. We illustrate that streaming PCA and subspace tracking algorithms can be understood through algebraic and geometric perspectives, and they need to be adjusted carefully to handle missing data. Both asymptotic and nonasymptotic convergence guarantees are reviewed. Finally, we benchmark the performance of several competitive algorithms in the presence of missing data for both well-conditioned and ill-conditioned systems.},

It is the first to integrate theory, key tools, and modern applications of high-dimensional probability. Concentration inequalities form the core, and it covers both classical results such as Hoeffding's and Chernoff's inequalities and modern developments such as the matrix Bernstein's inequality. It then introduces the powerful methods based on stochastic processes, including such tools as Slepian's, Sudakov's, and Dudley's inequalities, as well as generic chaining and bounds based on VC dimension. A broad range of illustrations is embedded throughout, including classical and modern results for covariance estimation, clustering, networks, semidefinite programming, coding, dimension reduction, matrix completion, machine learning, compressed sensing, and sparse regression.},

We show that the representation estimated by this multivariate technique is consistent and asymptotically invertible. This estimator has significant computational advantages over Maximum Likelihood, and more importantly may be more robust than ML to mis-specification of the vector moving average model. The estimation method is applied to a VMA model of wholesale and retail inventories, using Canadian data on inventory investment, and allows us to examine the propagation of shocks between the two classes of inventory.},

	abstract = {In this article, which consists of two parts (Part I: representation results; Part II: estimation and forecasting methods), we set up the theoretical foundations for a high-dimensional functional factor model approach in the analysis of large cross-sections (panels) of functional time series (FTS). In Part I, we establish a representation result stating that, under mild assumptions on the covariance operator of the cross-section, we can represent each FTS as the sum of a common component driven by scalar factors loaded via functional loadings, and a mildly cross-correlated idiosyncratic component. Our model and theory are developed in a general Hilbert space setting that allows for mixed panels of functional and scalar time series. We then turn, in Part II, to the identification of the number of factors, and the estimation of the factors, their loadings, and the common components. We provide a family of information criteria for identifying the number of factors, and prove their consistency. We provide average error bounds for the estimators of the factors, loadings, and common components; our results encompass the scalar case, for which they reproduce and extend, under weaker conditions, well-established similar results. Under slightly stronger assumptions, we also provide uniform bounds for the estimators of factors, loadings, and common components, thus extending existing scalar results. Our consistency results in the asymptotic regime where the number N of series and the number T of time observations diverge thus extend to the functional context the ‘blessing of dimensionality’ that explains the success of factor models in the analysis of high-dimensional (scalar) time series. We provide numerical illustrations that corroborate the convergence rates predicted by the theory, and provide a finer understanding of the interplay between N and T for estimation purposes. We conclude with an application to forecasting mortality curves, where we demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods.},

This algorithm is an advancement of the dynamic inner canonical correlation analysis (DiCCA) algorithm, which builds univariate latent autoregressive models that are noninteracting. The dynamic latent variable scores of the proposed algorithm are guaranteed to be orthogonal with a descending order of predictability, retaining the properties of DiCCA. Further, the LaVAR‑CCA algorithm solves multiple latent variables simultaneously with a statistical interpretation of the profile likelihood. The Lorenz oscillator with noisy measurements and an application case study on an industrial dataset are used to illustrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm. The reduced‑dimensional latent dynamic model has numerous potential applications for prediction, feature analysis, and diagnosis of systems with rich measurements.},

We simultaneously address both challenges by constructing a projection-based reduced model that accepts low-dimensional parameter inputs and whose model evaluations are inexpensive. The associated parameter and state bases are obtained through a greedy procedure that targets the governing equations, model outputs, and prior information.

The construction of the grid is the key novel piece of our analysis: we replace a large cloud of simulated points with a small set of “representative” points. We present three alternative techniques for constructing representative points: a clustering method, an ε-distinguishable set method, and a locally-adaptive variant of the ε-distinguishable set method. As an illustration, we solve one- and multi-agent neoclassical growth models and a large-scale new Keynesian model with a zero lower bound on nominal interest rates.

Recently developed algorithms have been successful at training RNNs to perform a wide variety of tasks, but the resulting networks have been treated as black boxes: their mechanism of operation remains unknown. Here we explore the hypothesis that fixed points, both stable and unstable, and the linearized dynamics around them, can reveal crucial aspects of how RNNs implement their computations. Further, we explore the utility of linearization in areas of phase space that are not true fixed points but merely points of very slow movement. We present a simple optimization technique that is applied to trained RNNs to find the fixed and slow points of their dynamics. Linearization around these slow regions can be used to explore, or reverse-engineer, the behavior of the RNN. We describe the technique, illustrate it using simple examples, and finally showcase it on three high-dimensional RNN examples: a 3-bit flip-flop device, an input-dependent sine wave generator, and a two-point moving average. In all cases, the mechanisms of trained networks could be inferred from the sets of fixed and slow points and the linearized dynamics around them.},

	abstract = {Recurrent neural network (RNN) based autoencoders, trained in an unsupervised manner, have been widely used to generate fixed-dimensional vector representations or embeddings for varying length multivariate time series. These embeddings have been demonstrated to be useful for time series reconstruction, classification, and creation of health index (HI) curves of machines being used in industrial applications, based on which the remaining useful life (RUL) of machines can be estimated. In this study, we extend the traditional form of RNN autoencoders as a feature extractor for multivariate time series to a more general form in terms of arranging the order of input or output sequences and the hidden unit architecture. We apply the embeddings obtained by different variants of RNN autoencoders for a time series classification task and a machine RUL estimation problem using two publicly available datasets. A random research strategy is used to find the optimal hyperparameters of all variants for each task in order to give a fair comparison of the general performance among different variants over a large hyperparameter space, as well as the best performance that each variant can achieve compared with the best reported values in the literature. Our results show that traditional reversing the order of output time series while maintaining the order of input time series when training an RNN autoencoder does not show improved performance for the two studied cases. Thus, intentionally arranging the input or output order seems unnecessary for training the RNN autoencoder as a feature extractor of time series. We further observe that only the RNN architectures with gating mechanism can achieve the functionality of encoding for the time series, and none of the three common gated architectures we studied shows significantly and consistently improved performance compared to the others on the two studied cases. However, the bidirectional RNN autoencoders yield slightly better performance than their unidirectional counterparts.},

Longitudinal studies have found stable responses to artificial stimuli across sessions in visual areas, but it is unclear whether this stability extends to naturalistic stimuli. We performed chronic 2-photon imaging of mouse V1 populations to directly compare the representational stability of artificial versus naturalistic visual stimuli over weeks. Responses to gratings were highly stable across sessions. However, neural responses to naturalistic movies exhibited progressive representational drift across sessions. Differential drift was present across cortical layers, in inhibitory interneurons, and could not be explained by differential response strength or higher order stimulus statistics. However, representational drift was accompanied by similar differential changes in local population correlation structure. These results suggest representational stability in V1 is stimulus-dependent and may relate to differences in preexisting circuit architecture of co-tuned neurons.},

Even the primary visual cortex (V1) represents other task-related variables such as expectations, choice, and context. However, it is unclear how V1 can flexibly accommodate these variables without interfering with visual representations. We trained mice on a context-switching cross-modal decision task, where performance depends on inferring task context. We found that the context signal that emerged in V1 was behaviorally relevant as it strongly covaried with performance, independent from movement. Importantly, this signal was integrated into V1 representation by multiplexing visual and context signals into orthogonal subspaces. In addition, auditory and choice signals were also multiplexed as these signals were orthogonal to the context representation. Thus, multiplexing allows V1 to integrate visual inputs with other sensory modalities and cognitive variables to avoid interference with the visual representation while ensuring the maintenance of task-relevant variables.},

	abstract = {Quantifying behavior is crucial for many applications in neuroscience. Videography provides easy methods for the observation and recording of animal behavior in diverse settings, yet extracting particular aspects of a behavior for further analysis can be highly time consuming. In motor control studies, humans or other animals are often marked with reflective markers to assist with computer-based tracking, but markers are intrusive, and the number and location of the markers must be determined a priori. Here we present an efficient method for markerless pose estimation based on transfer learning with deep neural networks that achieves excellent results with minimal training data. We demonstrate the versatility of this framework by tracking various body parts in multiple species across a broad collection of behaviors. Remarkably, even when only a small number of frames are labeled ({\textasciitilde}200), the algorithm achieves excellent tracking performance on test frames that is comparable to human accuracy.},

	abstract = {Data with a large number of variables relative to the sample size—"high-dimensional data"—are readily available and increasingly common in empirical economics. High-dimensional data arise through a combination of two phenomena. First, the data may be inherently high dimensional in that many different characteristics per observation are available. For example, the US Census collects information on hundreds of individual characteristics and scanner datasets record transaction-level data for households across a wide range of products. Second, even when the number of available variables is relatively small, researchers rarely know the exact functional form with which the small number of variables enter the model of interest. Researchers are thus faced with a large set of potential variables formed by different ways of interacting and transforming the underlying variables. This paper provides an overview of how innovations in "data mining" can be adapted and modified to provide high-quality inference about model parameters. Note that we use the term "data mining" in a modern sense which denotes a principled search for "true" predictive power that guards against false discovery and overfitting, does not erroneously equate in-sample fit to out-of-sample predictive ability, and accurately accounts for using the same data to examine many different hypotheses or models.},

	abstract = {Meta-learning, or learning-to-learn, seeks to design algorithms that can utilize previous experience to rapidly learn new skills or adapt to new environments. Representation learning—a key tool for performing meta-learning—learns a data representation that can transfer knowledge across multiple tasks, which is essential in regimes where data is scarce. Despite a recent surge of interest in the practice of meta-learning, the theoretical underpinnings of meta-learning algorithms are lacking, especially in the context of learning transferable representations. In this paper, we focus on the problem of multi-task linear regression—in which multiple linear regression models share a common, low-dimensional linear representation. Here, we provide provably fast, sample-efficient algorithms to address the dual challenges of (1) learning a common set of features from multiple, related tasks, and (2) transferring this knowledge to new, unseen tasks. Both are central to the general problem of meta-learning. Finally, we complement these results by providing information-theoretic lower bounds on the sample complexity of learning these linear features.},

	abstract = {PCA is one of the most widely used dimension reduction techniques. A related easier problem is "subspace learning" or "subspace estimation". Given relatively clean data, both are easily solved via singular value decomposition (SVD). The problem of subspace learning or PCA in the presence of outliers is called robust subspace learning or robust PCA (RPCA). For long data sequences, if one tries to use a single lower dimensional subspace to represent the data, the required subspace dimension may end up being quite large. For such data, a better model is to assume that it lies in a low-dimensional subspace that can change over time, albeit gradually. The problem of tracking such data (and the subspaces) while being robust to outliers is called robust subspace tracking (RST). This article provides a magazine-style overview of the entire field of robust subspace learning and tracking. In particular solutions for three problems are discussed in detail: RPCA via sparse+low-rank matrix decomposition (S+LR), RST via S+LR, and "robust subspace recovery (RSR)". RSR assumes that an entire data vector is either an outlier or an inlier. The S+LR formulation instead assumes that outliers occur on only a few data vector indices and hence are well modeled as sparse corruptions.},

	abstract = {This article is about a curious phenomenon. Suppose we have a data matrix, which is the superposition of a low-rank component and a sparse component. Can we recover each component individually? We prove that under some suitable assumptions, it is possible to recover both the low-rank and the sparse components exactly by solving a very convenient convex program called Principal Component Pursuit; among all feasible decompositions, simply minimize a weighted combination of the nuclear norm and of the ℓ1 norm. This suggests the possibility of a principled approach to robust principal component analysis since our methodology and results assert that one can recover the principal components of a data matrix even though a positive fraction of its entries are arbitrarily corrupted. This extends to the situation where a fraction of the entries are missing as well. We discuss an algorithm for solving this optimization problem, and present applications in the area of video surveillance, where our methodology allows for the detection of objects in a cluttered background, and in the area of face recognition, where it offers a principled way of removing shadows and specularities in images of faces.},

In this article, we examine online regulation of (possibly unstable) partially unknown linear systems with no prior access to an initial stabilizing controller nor PE input–output data; we instead leverage the knowledge of the input matrix for online regulation. First, we introduce and characterize the notion of “regularizability” for linear systems that gauges the extent by which a system can be regulated in finite-time in contrast to its asymptotic behavior (commonly characterized by stabilizability/controllability). Next, having access only to the input matrix, we propose the data-guided regulation (DGR) synthesis procedure that—as its name suggests—regulates the underlying state while also generating informative data that can subsequently be used for data-driven stabilization or system identification. We further improve the computational performance of DGR via a rank-one update and demonstrate its utility in online regulation of the X-29 aircraft.},

	doi = {10.1109/CDC45484.2021.9682778},
	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate when system identification is statistically easy or hard, in the finite sample regime. Statistically easy to learn linear system classes have sample complexity that is polynomial with the system dimension. Most prior research in the finite sample regime falls in this category, focusing on systems that are directly excited by process noise. Statistically hard to learn linear system classes have worst-case sample complexity that is at least exponential with the system dimension, regardless of the identification algorithm. Using tools from minimax theory, we show that classes of linear systems can be hard to learn. Such classes include, for example, under-actuated or under-excited systems with weak coupling among the states. Having classified some systems as easy or hard to learn, a natural question arises as to what system properties fundamentally affect the hardness of system identifiability. Towards this direction, we characterize how the controllability index of linear systems affects the sample complexity of identification. More specifically, we show that the sample complexity of robustly controllable linear systems is upper bounded by an exponential function of the controllability index. This implies that identification is easy for classes of linear systems with small controllability index and potentially hard if the controllability index is large. Our analysis is based on recent statistical tools for finite sample analysis of system identification as well as a novel lower bound that relates controllability index with the least singular value of the controllability Gramian.},

	abstract = {Learning algorithms have become an integral component to modern engineering solutions. Examples range from self-driving cars and recommender systems to finance and even critical infrastructure, many of which are typically under the purview of control theory. While these algorithms have already shown tremendous promise in certain applications [1], there are considerable challenges, in particular, with respect to guaranteeing safety and gauging fundamental limits of operation. Thus, as we integrate tools from machine learning into our systems, we also require an integrated theoretical understanding of how they operate in the presence of dynamic and system-theoretic phenomena. Over the past few years, intense efforts toward this goal—an integrated theoretical understanding of learning, dynamics, and control—have been made. While much work remains to be done, a relatively clear and complete picture has begun to emerge for (fully observed) linear dynamical systems. These systems already allow for reasoning about concrete failure modes, thus helping to indicate a path forward. Moreover, while simple at a glance, these systems can be challenging to analyze. Recently, a host of methods from learning theory and high-dimensional statistics, not typically in the control-theoretic toolbox, have been introduced to our community. This tutorial survey serves as an introduction to these results for learning in the context of unknown linear dynamical systems (see “Summary”). We review the current state of the art and emphasize which tools are needed to arrive at these results. Our focus is on characterizing the sample efficiency and fundamental limits of learning algorithms. Along the way, we also delineate a number of open problems. More concretely, this article is structured as follows. We begin by revisiting recent advances in the finite-sample analysis of system identification. Next, we discuss how these finite-sample bounds can be used downstream to give guaranteed performance for learning-based offline control. The final technical section discusses the more challenging online control setting. Finally, in light of the material discussed, we outline a number of future directions.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we study the statistical difficulty of learning to control linear systems. We focus on two standard benchmarks, the sample complexity of stabilization, and the regret of the online learning of the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR). Prior results state that the statistical difficulty for both benchmarks scales polynomially with the system state dimension up to system-theoretic quantities. However, this does not reveal the whole picture. By utilizing minimax lower bounds for both benchmarks, we prove that there exist non-trivial classes of systems for which learning complexity scales dramatically, i.e. exponentially, with the system dimension. This situation arises in the case of underactuated systems, i.e. systems with fewer inputs than states. Such systems are structurally difficult to control and their system theoretic quantities can scale exponentially with the system dimension dominating learning complexity. Under some additional structural assumptions (bounding systems away from uncontrollability), we provide qualitatively matching upper bounds. We prove that learning complexity can be at most exponential with the controllability index of the system, that is the degree of underactuation.},

	abstract = {In this work, we study the problem of learning partially observed linear dynamical systems from a single sample trajectory. A major practical challenge in the existing system identification methods is the undesirable dependency of their required sample size on the system dimension: roughly speaking, they presume and rely on sample sizes that scale linearly with the system dimension. Evidently, in high-dimensional regime where the system dimension is large, it may be costly, if not impossible, to collect as many samples from the unknown system. In this paper, we introduce an regularized estimator that can accurately estimate the Markov parameters of the system, provided that the number of samples scale poly-logarithmically with the system dimension. Our result significantly improves the sample complexity of learning partially observed linear dynamical systems: it shows that the Markov parameters of the system can be learned in the high-dimensional setting, where the number of samples is significantly smaller than the system dimension.},

In the fixed budget setting, the learner aims at estimating the state transition matrix A from a random system trajectory of fixed length, whereas in the fixed confidence setting, the learner also controls the length of the observed trajectory – she can stop when she believes that enough information has been gathered. For both settings, we analyze the sample complexity in the probably approximately correct (PAC) framework defined as the length of the observed trajectory required to identify the system parameters with prescribed accuracy and confidence levels ({\textbackslash}varepsilon, {\textbackslash}delta). In the fixed budget setting, we first establish problem-specific sample complexity lower bounds. We then present a finite-time analysis of the estimation error of the least-squares estimator (LSE) for stable systems, and show that in the high-accuracy regime, the sample complexity of the LSE matches our lower bounds. Our analysis of the LSE is sharper and easier to interpret than existing analyzes, and relies on novel concentration results for the covariates matrix. In the fixed confidence setting, in addition to the estimation objective, the learner also has to decide when to stop the collection of observations. The sample complexity then corresponds to the expected stopping time. For this setting, we also provide problem specific sample complexity lower bounds. We also propose a stopping rule which combined to the LSE enjoys a sample complexity that matches our lower bounds in the high-accuracy and high-confidence regime.},

Two of these methods are based on the information contained in the estimated singular values, while the third method is based on the estimated innovation variance. The case with observed inputs is treated as well as the case without exogenous inputs. The two methods based on the singular values are shown to be consistent under fairly mild assumptions, while the same result for the third approach is only obtained on a generic set. The former can be applied to Larimore type of procedures as well as to MOESP type of procedures, whereas the third is only applied to Larimore type of algorithms. This has implications for the estimation of the order of systems, which are close to the exceptional set, as is shown in a numerical example. All the estimation methods involve the choice of a penalty term. Sufficient conditions on the penalty term to guarantee consistency are derived. The effects of different choices of the penalty term are investigated in a simulation study.},

	abstract = {Linear dynamical systems are the foundational statistical model upon which control theory is built. Both the celebrated Kalman filter and the linear quadratic regulator require knowledge of the system dynamics to provide analytic guarantees. Naturally, learning the dynamics of a linear dynamical system from linear measurements has been intensively studied since Rudolph Kalman's pioneering work in the 1960's. Towards these ends, we provide the first polynomial time algorithm for learning a linear dynamical system from a polynomial length trajectory up to polynomial error in the system parameters under essentially minimal assumptions; observability, controllability, and marginal stability. Our algorithm is built on a method of moments estimator to directly estimate Markov parameters from which the dynamics can be extracted. Furthermore we provide statistical lower bounds when our observability and controllability assumptions are violated.},

	abstract = {This paper studies the problem of identifying low-order linear time-invariant systems via Hankel nuclear norm (HNN) regularization. This regularization encourages the Hankel matrix to be low-rank, which corresponds to the dynamical system being of low order. We provide novel statistical analysis for this regularization, and contrast it with the unregularized ordinary least-squares (OLS) estimator. Our analysis leads to new finite-sample error bounds on estimating the impulse response and the Hankel matrix associated with the linear system using HNN regularization. We design a suitable input excitation, and show that we can recover the system using a number of observations that scales optimally with the true system order and achieves strong statistical estimation rates. Complementing these, we also demonstrate that the input design indeed matters by proving that intuitive choices, such as i.i.d. Gaussian input, lead to sub-optimal sample complexity. To better understand the benefits of regularization, we also revisit the OLS estimator. Besides refining existing bounds, we experimentally identify when HNN regularization improves over OLS: (1) For low-order systems with slow impulse-response decay, OLS method performs poorly in terms of sample complexity, (2) the Hankel matrix returned by regularization has a more clear singular value gap that makes determining the system order easier, (3) HNN regularization is less sensitive to hyperparameter choice. To choose the regularization parameter, we also outline a simple joint train-validation procedure.},

	abstract = {Low-dimensional and compact representation of time series data is of importance for mining and storage. In practice, time series data are vulnerable to various temporal transformations, such as shift and temporal scaling, however, which are unavoidable in the process of data collection. If a learning algorithm directly calculates the difference between such transformed data based on Euclidean distance, the measurement cannot faithfully reflect the similarity and hence could not learn the underlying discriminative features. In order to solve this problem, we develop a novel subspace learning algorithm based on dynamic time warping (DTW) distance which is an elastic distance defined in a DTW space. The algorithm aims to minimize the reconstruction error in the DTW space. However, since DTW space is a semi-pseudo metric space, it is difficult to generalize common subspace learning algorithms for such semi-pseudo metric spaces. In this work, we introduce warp operators with which DTW reconstruction error can be approximated by reconstruction error between transformed series and their reconstructions in a subspace. The warp operators align time series data with their linear representations in the DTW space, which is in particular important for misaligned time series, so that the subspace can be learned to obtain an intrinsic basis (dictionary) for the representation of the data. The warp operators and the subspace are optimized alternatively until reaching equilibrium. Experiments results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms traditional subspace learning algorithms and temporal transform-invariance based methods (including SIDL, Kernel PCA, and SPMC et. al), and obtains competitive results with the state-of-the-art algorithms, such as BOSS algorithm.},

Given some approximations to a cluster of neighboring eigenvalues and to the corresponding eigenvectors of a real symmetric matrix, and given an estimate for the gap that separates the cluster from all other eigenvalues, how much can the subspace spanned by the eigenvectors differ from the subspace spanned by our approximations? These questions are closely related; both are investigated here. The difference between the two subspaces is characterized in terms of certain angles through which one subspace must be rotated in order most directly to reach the other. These angles unify the treatment of natural geometric, operator-theoretic and error-analytic questions concerning those subspaces. Sharp bounds upon trigonometric functions of these angles are obtained from the gap and from bounds upon either the perturbation (1st question) or a computable residual (2nd question). An example is included.},

These bounds may be bad news for small eigenvalues (singular values), which thereby suffer worse relative uncertainty than large ones. However, there are situations where even small eigenvalues are determined to high relative accuracy by the data much more accurately than the classical perturbation theory would indicate. In this paper, we study how eigenvalues of a Hermitian matrix A change when it is perturbed to \${\textbackslash}wtd A=D{\textasciicircum}*AD\$, where D is close to a unitary matrix, and how singular values of a (nonsquare) matrix B change when it is perturbed to \${\textbackslash}wtd B=D\_1{\textasciicircum}*BD\_2\$, where D1 and D2 are nearly unitary. It is proved that under these kinds of perturbations small eigenvalues (singular values) suffer relative changes no worse than large eigenvalues (singular values).

	abstract = {Noisy, high-dimensional time series observations can often be described by a set of low-dimensional latent variables. Commonly used methods to extract these latent variables typically assume instantaneous relationships between the latent and observed variables. In many physical systems, changes in the latent variables manifest as changes in the observed variables after time delays. Techniques that do not account for these delays can recover a larger number of latent variables than are present in the system, thereby making the latent representation more difficult to interpret. In this work, we introduce a novel probabilistic technique, time-delay gaussian-process factor analysis (TD-GPFA), that performs dimensionality reduction in the presence of a different time delay between each pair of latent and observed variables. We demonstrate how using a gaussian process to model the evolution of each latent variable allows us to tractably learn these delays over a continuous domain. Additionally, we show how TD-GPFA combines temporal smoothing and dimensionality reduction into a common probabilistic framework. We present an expectation/conditional maximization either (ECME) algorithm to learn the model parameters. Our simulations demonstrate that when time delays are present, TD-GPFA is able to correctly identify these delays and recover the latent space. We then applied TD-GPFA to the activity of tens of neurons recorded simultaneously in the macaque motor cortex during a reaching task. TD-GPFA is able to better describe the neural activity using a more parsimonious latent space than GPFA, a method that has been used to interpret motor cortex data but does not account for time delays. More broadly, TD-GPFA can help to unravel the mechanisms underlying high-dimensional time series data by taking into account physical delays in the system.},

We address both of these issues in this paper. We ﬁrst present the necessary and sufﬁcient condition for unknown noise covariance estimation; these conditions are related to the rank of a matrix involving the auto and cross-covariances of a weighted sum of innovations, where the weights are the coefﬁcients of the minimal polynomial of the closed-loop system transition matrix of a stable, but not necessarily optimal, Kalman ﬁlter. We present an optimization criterion and a novel six-step approach based on a successive approximation, coupled with a gradient algorithm with adaptive step sizes, to estimate the steady-state Kalman ﬁlter gain, the unknown noise covariance matrices, as well as the state prediction (and updated) error covariance matrix. Our approach enforces the structural assumptions on unknown noise covariances and ensures symmetry and positive deﬁniteness of the estimated covariance matrices. We provide several approaches to estimate the unknown measurement noise covariance R via post-ﬁt residuals, an approach not yet exploited in the literature. The validation of the proposed method on ﬁve different test cases from the literature demonstrates that the proposed method signiﬁcantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

We observe that although the underlying process behaves quite differently in each of these three regimes, the systematic analysis of a self–normalized martingale difference term helps bound identification error up to logarithmic factors of the lower bound. On the other hand, we demonstrate that the least squares solution may be statistically inconsistent under certain conditions even when the signal-to-noise ratio is high.},

Recent work has provided non-asymptotic results on partially observed LTI system identification using a single trajectory but is only suitable for stable systems. We provide finite-time analysis for learning Markov parameters based on the ordinary least-squares (OLS) estimator using multiple trajectories, which covers both stable and unstable systems. For unstable systems, our results suggest that the Markov parameters are harder to estimate in the presence of process noise. Without process noise, our upper bound on the estimation error is independent of the spectral radius of system dynamics with high probability. These two features are different from fully observed LTI systems for which recent work has shown that unstable systems with a bigger spectral radius are easier to estimate. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the performance of our OLS estimator.},

	abstract = {Identification of the parameters of stable linear dynamical systems is a well-studied problem in the literature, both in the low and high-dimensionalsettings. However, there are hardly any results for the unstable case, especially regarding finite time bounds. For this setting, classical results on least-squares estimation of the dynamics parameters are not applicable and therefore new concepts and technical approaches need to be developed to address the issue. Unstable linear systems arise in key real applications in control theory, econometrics, and finance. This study establishes finite time bounds for the identification error of the least-squares estimates for a fairly large class of heavy-tailed noise distributions, and transition matrices of such systems. The results relate the time length (samples) required for estimation to a function of the problem dimension and key characteristics of the true underlying transition matrix and the noise distribution. To establish them, appropriate concentration inequalities for random matrices and for sequences of martingale differences are leveraged.},

	abstract = {We consider the problem of black-box control: the task of controlling an unknown linear time-invariant dynamical system from a single trajectory without a stabilizing controller. Under the assumption that the system is controllable, we give the first \{{\textbackslash}it efficient\} algorithm that is capable of attaining sublinear regret under the setting of online nonstochastic control. This resolves an open problem since the work of Abbasi-Yadkori and Szepesvari(2011) on the stochastic LQR problem, and in a more challenging setting that allows for adversarial perturbations and adversarially chosen changing convex loss functions. We give finite-time regret bounds for our algorithm on the order of 2𝑝𝑜𝑙𝑦(𝑑)+𝑂̃(𝑝𝑜𝑙𝑦(𝑑)𝑇2/3)2poly(d)+O{\textasciitilde}(poly(d)T2/3)2{\textasciicircum}\{poly(d)\} + {\textbackslash}tilde\{O\}(poly(d) T{\textasciicircum}\{2/3\}) for general nonstochastic control, and 2𝑝𝑜𝑙𝑦(𝑑)+𝑂̃(𝑝𝑜𝑙𝑦(𝑑)𝑇‾‾√)2poly(d)+O{\textasciitilde}(poly(d)T)2{\textasciicircum}\{poly(d)\} + {\textbackslash}tilde\{O\}(poly(d) {\textbackslash}sqrt\{T\}) for black-box LQR. To complete the picture, we investigate the complexity of the online black-box control problem and give a matching regret lower bound of 2Ω(𝑑)2Ω(d)2{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}Omega(d)\}, showing that the exponential cost is inevitable. This lower bound holds even in the noiseless setting, and applies to any, randomized or deterministic, black-box control method.},

We focus on learning the best lower order approximation allowed by finite data. Motivated by subspace algorithms in systems theory, where the doubly infinite system Hankel matrix captures both order and good lower order approximations, we construct a Hankel-like matrix from noisy finite data using ordinary least squares. This circumvents the non-convexities that arise in system identification, and allows accurate estimation of the underlying LTI system. Our results rely on careful analysis of self-normalized martingale difference terms that helps bound identification error up to logarithmic factors of the lower bound. We provide a data-dependent scheme for order selection and find an accurate realization of system parameters, corresponding to that order, by an approach that is closely related to the Ho-Kalman subspace algorithm. We demonstrate that the proposed model order selection procedure is not overly conservative, i.e., for the given data length it is not possible to estimate higher order models or find higher order approximations with reasonable accuracy.},

	abstract = {This paper establishes problem-specific sample complexity lower bounds for linear system identification problems. The sample complexity is defined in the PAC framework: it corresponds to the time it takes to identify the system parameters with prescribed accuracy and confidence levels. By problem-specific, we mean that the lower bound explicitly depends on the system to be identified (which contrasts with minimax lower bounds), and hence really captures the identification hardness specific to the system. We consider both uncontrolled and controlled systems. For uncontrolled systems, the lower bounds are valid for any linear system, stable or not, and only depend on the system finite-time controllability gramian. A simplified lower bound depending on the spectrum of the system only is also derived. In view of recent finite-time analysis of classical estimation methods (e.g. ordinary least squares), our sample complexity lower bounds are tight for many systems. For controlled systems, our lower bounds are not as explicit as in the case of uncontrolled systems, but could well provide interesting insights into the design of control policy with minimal sample complexity.},

	abstract = {The affine rank minimization problem consists of finding a matrix of minimum rank that satisfies a given system of linear equality constraints. Such problems have appeared in the literature of a diverse set of fields including system identification and control, Euclidean embedding, and collaborative filtering. Although specific instances can often be solved with specialized algorithms, the general affine rank minimization problem is NP-hard because it contains vector cardinality minimization as a special case. In this paper, we show that if a certain restricted isometry property holds for the linear transformation defining the constraints, the minimum-rank solution can be recovered by solving a convex optimization problem, namely, the minimization of the nuclear norm over the given affine space. We present several random ensembles of equations where the restricted isometry property holds with overwhelming probability, provided the codimension of the subspace is sufficiently large. The techniques used in our analysis have strong parallels in the compressed sensing framework. We discuss how affine rank minimization generalizes this preexisting concept and outline a dictionary relating concepts from cardinality minimization to those of rank minimization. We also discuss several algorithmic approaches to minimizing the nuclear norm and illustrate our results with numerical examples. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},
