It has previously been hypothesized, and supported with some experimental
evidence, that deeper representations, when well trained, tend to do a better
job at disentangling the underlying factors of variation. We study the
following related conjecture: better representations, in the sense of better
disentangling, can be exploited to produce faster-mixing Markov chains.
Consequently, mixing would be more efficient at higher levels of
representation. To better understand why and how this is happening, we propose
a secondary conjecture: the higher-level samples fill more uniformly the space
they occupy and the high-density manifolds tend to unfold when represented at
higher levels. The paper discusses these hypotheses and tests them
experimentally through visualization and measurements of mixing and
interpolating between samples.
