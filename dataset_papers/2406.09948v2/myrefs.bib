abstract = {Structured knowledge is important for many AI applications. Commonsense knowledge, which is crucial for robust human-centric AI, is covered by a small number of structured knowledge projects. However, they lack knowledge about human traits and behaviors conditioned on socio-cultural contexts, which is crucial for situative AI. This paper presents Candle, an end-to-end methodology for extracting high-quality cultural commonsense knowledge (CCSK) at scale. Candle extracts CCSK assertions from a huge web corpus and organizes them into coherent clusters, for 3 domains of subjects (geography, religion, occupation) and several cultural facets (food, drinks, clothing, traditions, rituals, behaviors). Candle includes judicious techniques for classification-based filtering and scoring of interestingness. Experimental evaluations show the superiority of the Candle CCSK collection over prior works, and an extrinsic use case demonstrates the benefits of CCSK for the GPT-3 language model.

abstract = {Current Sundanese stemmers either ignore reduplication words or define rules to handle only affixes. There is a significant amount of reduplication words in the Sundanese language. Because of that, it is impossible to achieve superior stemming precision in the Sundanese language without addressing reduplication words. This paper presents an improved stemmer for the Sundanese language, which handles affixed and reduplicated words. With a Sundanese root word list, we use a rules-based stemming technique. In our approach, all stems produced by the affixes removal or normalization processes are added to the stem list. Using a stem list can help increase stemmer accuracy by reducing stemming errors caused by affix removal sequence errors or morphological issues. The current Sundanese language stemmer, RBSS, was used as a comparison. Two datasets with 8218 unique affixed words and reduplication words were evaluated. The results show that our stemmer's strength and accuracy have improved noticeably. The use of stem list and word reduplication rules improved our stemmer's affixed type recognition and allowed us to achieve up to 99.30\% accuracy.},
