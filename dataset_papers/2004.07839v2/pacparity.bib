	Abstract = {Misapplication of statistical data analysis is a common cause of spurious discoveries in scientific research. Existing approaches to ensuring the validity of inferences drawn from data assume a fixed procedure to be performed, selected before the data are examined. In common practice, however, data analysis is an intrinsically adaptive process, with new analyses generated on the basis of data exploration, as well as the results of previous analyses on the same data. We demonstrate a new approach for addressing the challenges of adaptivity based on insights from privacy-preserving data analysis. As an application, we show how to safely reuse a holdout data set many times to validate the results of adaptively chosen analyses.},

@inproceedings{Balcan17a,
	Abstract = {We study the problem of clustering sensitive data while preserving the privacy of individuals represented in the dataset, which has broad applications in practical machine learning and data analysis tasks. Although the problem has been widely studied in the context of low-dimensional, discrete spaces, much remains unknown concerning private clustering in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces $\mathbb{R}^d$. In this work, we give differentially private and efficient algorithms achieving strong guarantees for $k$-means and $k$-median clustering when $d=\Omega(\mathsf{polylog}(n))$. Our algorithm achieves clustering loss at most $\log^3(n)\mathsf{OPT}+\mathsf{poly}(\log n,d,k)$, advancing the state-of-the-art result of $\sqrt{d}\mathsf{OPT}+\mathsf{poly}(\log n,d^d,k^d)$. We also study the case where the data points are $s$-sparse and show that the clustering loss can scale logarithmically with $d$, i.e., $\log^3(n)\mathsf{OPT}+\mathsf{poly}(\log n,\log d,k,s)$. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},
