Contrary to many conventional KBs that store knowledge with canonical templates, commonsense KBs only store loosely structured open-text descriptions of knowledge. We posit that an important step toward automatic commonsense completion is the development of generative models of commonsense knowledge, and propose COMmonsEnse Transformers (COMET) that learn to generate rich and diverse commonsense descriptions in natural language. Despite the challenges of commonsense modeling, our investigation reveals promising results when implicit knowledge from deep pre-trained language models is transferred to generate explicit knowledge in commonsense knowledge graphs. Empirical results demonstrate that COMET is able to generate novel knowledge that humans rate as high quality, with up to 77.5{\%} (ATOMIC) and 91.7{\%} (ConceptNet) precision at top 1, which approaches human performance for these resources. Our findings suggest that using generative commonsense models for automatic commonsense KB completion could soon be a plausible alternative to extractive methods.",

However, these approaches are fundamentally bounded by the correctness of explanations, which themselves are often noisy and inconsistent. In this work, we develop Maieutic Prompting, which aims to infer a correct answer to a question even from the unreliable generations of LM. Maieutic Prompting induces a tree of explanations abductively (e.g. X is true, because ...) and recursively, then frames the inference as a satisfiability problem over these explanations and their logical relations. We test Maieutic Prompting for true/false QA on three challenging benchmarks that require complex commonsense reasoning. Maieutic Prompting achieves up to 20{\%} better accuracy than state-of-the-art prompting methods, and as a fully unsupervised approach, performs competitively with supervised models. We also show that Maieutic Prompting improves robustness in inference while providing interpretable rationales.",

    abstract = "While large pre-trained language models are powerful, their predictions often lack logical consistency across test inputs. For example, a state-of-the-art Macaw question-answering (QA) model answers {\textless}i{\textgreater}Yes{\textless}/i{\textgreater} to {\textless}i{\textgreater}Is a sparrow a bird?{\textless}/i{\textgreater} and {\textless}i{\textgreater}Does a bird have feet?{\textless}/i{\textgreater} but answers {\textless}i{\textgreater}No{\textless}/i{\textgreater} to {\textless}i{\textgreater}Does a sparrow have feet?{\textless}/i{\textgreater}. To address this failure mode, we propose a framework, Consistency Correction through Relation Detection, or {\textless}b{\textgreater}ConCoRD{\textless}/b{\textgreater}, for boosting the consistency and accuracy of pre-trained NLP models using pre-trained natural language inference (NLI) models without fine-tuning or re-training. Given a batch of test inputs, ConCoRD samples several candidate outputs for each input and instantiates a factor graph that accounts for both the model{'}s belief about the likelihood of each answer choice in isolation and the NLI model{'}s beliefs about pair-wise answer choice compatibility. We show that a weighted MaxSAT solver can efficiently compute high-quality answer choices under this factor graph, improving over the raw model{'}s predictions. Our experiments demonstrate that ConCoRD consistently boosts accuracy and consistency of off-the-shelf closed-book QA and VQA models using off-the-shelf NLI models, notably increasing accuracy of LXMERT on ConVQA by 5{\%} absolute.

abstract = {This paper introduces corpus-guided top-down synthesis as a mechanism for synthesizing library functions that capture common functionality from a corpus of programs in a domain specific language (DSL). The algorithm builds abstractions directly from initial DSL primitives, using syntactic pattern matching of intermediate abstractions to intelligently prune the search space and guide the algorithm towards abstractions that maximally capture shared structures in the corpus. We present an implementation of the approach in a tool called Stitch and evaluate it against the state-of-the-art deductive library learning algorithm from DreamCoder. Our evaluation shows that Stitch is 3-4 orders of magnitude faster and uses 2 orders of magnitude less memory while maintaining comparable or better library quality (as measured by compressivity). We also demonstrate Stitch‚Äôs scalability on corpora containing hundreds of complex programs that are intractable with prior deductive approaches and show empirically that it is robust to terminating the search procedure early‚Äîfurther allowing it to scale to challenging datasets by means of early stopping.},

abstract = {The use of deep learning techniques has achieved significant progress for program synthesis from input-output examples. However, when the program semantics become more complex, it still remains a challenge to synthesize programs that are consistent with the specification. In this work, we propose SED, a neural program generation framework that incorporates synthesis, execution, and debugging stages. Instead of purely relying on the neural program synthesizer to generate the final program, SED first produces initial programs using the neural program synthesizer component, then utilizes a neural program debugger to iteratively repair the generated programs. The integration of the debugger component enables SED to modify the programs based on the execution results and specification, which resembles the coding process of human programmers. On Karel, a challenging input-output program synthesis benchmark, SED reduces the error rate of the neural program synthesizer itself by a considerable margin, and outperforms the standard beam search for decoding.},

  abstract = 	 {Humans can learn and reason under substantial uncertainty in a space of infinitely many compositional, productive concepts. For example, if a scene with two blue spheres qualifies as ‚Äúdaxy,‚Äù one can reason that the underlying concept may require scenes to have ‚Äúonly blue spheres‚Äù or ‚Äúonly spheres‚Äù or ‚Äúonly two objects.‚Äù In contrast, standard benchmarks for compositional reasoning do not explicitly capture a notion of reasoning under uncertainty or evaluate compositional concept acquisition. We introduce a new benchmark, Compositional Reasoning Under Uncertainty (CURI) that instantiates a series of few-shot, meta-learning tasks in a productive concept space to evaluate different aspects of systematic generalization under uncertainty, including splits that test abstract understandings of disentangling, productive generalization, learning boolean operations, variable binding, etc. Importantly, we also contribute a model-independent ‚Äúcompositionality gap‚Äù to evaluate the difficulty of generalizing out-of-distribution along each of these axes, allowing objective comparison of the difficulty of each compositional split. Evaluations across a range of modeling choices and splits reveal substantial room for improvement on the proposed benchmark.}

abstract = {Since the late 1990s predicate invention has been under-explored within inductive logic programming due to difficulties in formulating efficient search mechanisms. However, a recent paper demonstrated that both predicate invention and the learning of recursion can be efficiently implemented for regular and context-free grammars, by way of metalogical substitutions with respect to a modified Prolog meta-interpreter which acts as the learning engine. New predicate symbols are introduced as constants representing existentially quantified higher-order variables. The approach demonstrates that predicate invention can be treated as a form of higher-order logical reasoning. In this paper we generalise the approach of meta-interpretive learning (MIL) to that of learning higher-order dyadic datalog programs. We show that with an infinite signature the higher-order dyadic datalog class $$H^2_2$$H22 has universal Turing expressivity though $$H^2_2$$H22 is decidable given a finite signature. Additionally we show that Knuth---Bendix ordering of the hypothesis space together with logarithmic clause bounding allows our MIL implementation Metagol$$_{D}$$D to PAC-learn minimal cardinality $$H^2_2$$H22 definitions. This result is consistent with our experiments which indicate that Metagol$$_{D}$$D efficiently learns compact $$H^2_2$$H22 definitions involving predicate invention for learning robotic strategies, the East---West train challenge and NELL. Additionally higher-order concepts were learned in the NELL language learning domain. The Metagol code and datasets described in this paper have been made publicly available on a website to allow reproduction of results in this paper.},

publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {The problem of automatically generating a computer program from some specification has been studied since the early days of AI. Recently, two competing approaches for automatic program learning have received significant attention: (1) neural program synthesis, where a neural network is conditioned on input/output (I/O) examples and learns to generate a program, and (2) neural program induction, where a neural network generates new outputs directly using a latent program representation. Here, for the first time, we directly compare both approaches on a large-scale, real-world learning task and we additionally contrast to rule-based program synthesis, which uses hand-crafted semantics to guide the program generation. Our neural models use a modified attention RNN to allow encoding of variable-sized sets of I/O pairs, which achieve 92\% accuracy on a real-world test set, compared to the 34\% accuracy of the previous best neural synthesis approach. The synthesis model also outperforms a comparable induction model on this task, but we more importantly demonstrate that the strength of each approach is highly dependent on the evaluation metric and end-user application. Finally, we show that we can train our neural models to remain very robust to the type of noise expected in real-world data (e.g., typos), while a highly-engineered rule-based system fails entirely.},

abstract = {A key challenge in program synthesis is the astronomical size of the search space the synthesizer has to explore. In response to this challenge, recent work proposed to guide synthesis using learned probabilistic models. Obtaining such a model, however, might be infeasible for a problem domain where no high-quality training data is available. In this work we introduce an alternative approach to guided program synthesis: instead of training a model ahead of time we show how to bootstrap one just in time, during synthesis, by learning from partial solutions encountered along the way. To make the best use of the model, we also propose a new program enumeration algorithm we dub guided bottom-up search, which extends the efficient bottom-up search with guidance from probabilistic models.  We implement this approach in a tool called Probe, which targets problems in the popular syntax-guided synthesis (SyGuS) format. We evaluate Probe on benchmarks from the literature and show that it achieves significant performance gains both over unguided bottom-up search and over a state-of-the-art probability-guided synthesizer, which had been trained on a corpus of existing solutions. Moreover, we show that these performance gains do not come at the cost of solution quality: programs generated by Probe are only slightly more verbose than the shortest solutions and perform no unnecessary case-splitting.},

abstract = {We present a neural program synthesis approach integrating components which write, execute, and assess code to navigate the search space of possible programs. We equip the search process with an interpreter or a read-eval-print-loop (REPL), which immediately executes partially written programs, exposing their semantics. The REPL addresses a basic challenge of program synthesis: tiny changes in syntax can lead to huge changes in semantics. We train a pair of models, a policy that proposes the new piece of code to write, and a value function that assesses the prospects of the code written so-far. At test time we can combine these models with a Sequential Monte Carlo algorithm. We apply our approach to two domains: synthesizing text editing programs and inferring 2D and 3D graphics programs.},

Our novel observation is that many PBE algorithms are a natural fall-out of one generic meta-algorithm and the domain-specific properties of the operators in the underlying domain-specific language (DSL). The meta-algorithm propagates example-based constraints on an expression to its subexpressions by leveraging associated witness functions, which essentially capture the inverse semantics of the underlying operator. This observation enables a novel program synthesis methodology called data-driven domain-specific deduction (D4), where domain-specific insight, provided by the DSL designer, is separated from the synthesis algorithm. Our FlashMeta framework implements this methodology, allowing synthesizer developers to generate an efficient synthesizer from the mere DSL definition (if properties of the DSL operators have been modeled). In our case studies, we found that 10+ existing industrial-quality mass-market applications based on PBE can be cast as instances of D4. Our evaluation includes reimplementation of some prior works, which in FlashMeta become more efficient, maintainable, and extensible.

abstract = {We study the problem of efficiently predicting a correct program from a large set of programs induced from few input-output examples in Programming-by-Example (PBE) systems. This is an important problem for making PBE systems usable so that users do not need to provide too many examples to learn the desired program. We first formalize the two classes of sharing that occurs in version-space algebra (VSA) based PBE systems, namely set-based sharing and path-based sharing. We then present a supervised machine learning approach for learning a hierarchical ranking function to efficiently predict a correct program. The key observation of our learning approach is that ranking any correct program higher than all incorrect programs is sufficient for generating the correct output on new inputs, which leads to a novel loss function in the gradient descent based learning algorithm. We evaluate our ranking technique for the FlashFill PBE system on over 175 benchmarks obtained from the Excel product team and help forums. Our ranking technique works in real-time, reduces the average number of examples required for learning the desired transformation from 4.17 to 1.48, and learns the transformation from just one input-output example for 74% of the benchmarks. The ranking scheme played a pivotal role in making FlashFill usable for millions of Excel users.},

address = {San Francisco, CA, USA},
abstract = {We introduce ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. A ProbLog program defines a distribution over logic programs by specifying for each clause the probability that it belongs to a randomly sampled program, and these probabilities are mutually independent. The semantics of ProbLog is then defined by the success probability of a query, which corresponds to the probability that the query succeeds in a randomly sampled program. The key contribution of this paper is the introduction of an effective solver for computing success probabilities. It essentially combines SLD-resolution with methods for computing the probability of Boolean formulae. Our implementation further employs an approximation algorithm that combines iterative deepening with binary decision diagrams. We report on experiments in the context of discovering links in real biological networks, a demonstration of the practical usefulness of the approach.},

abstract = {Formal languages for probabilistic modeling enable re-use, modularity, and descriptive clarity, and can foster generic inference techniques. We introduce Church, a universal language for describing stochastic generative processes. Church is based on the Lisp model of lambda calculus, containing a pure Lisp as its deterministic subset. The semantics of Church is defined in terms of evaluation histories and conditional distributions on such histories. Church also includes a novel language construct, the stochastic memoizer, which enables simple description of many complex non-parametric models. We illustrate language features through several examples, including: a generalized Bayes net in which parameters cluster over trials, infinite PCFGs, planning by inference, and various non-parametric clustering models. Finally, we show how to implement query on any Church program, exactly and approximately, using Monte Carlo techniques.},

The library and search policy bootstrap each other iteratively through a variant of "wake-sleep" approximate Bayesian learning. A new refactoring algorithm based on E-graph matching identifies common sub-components across synthesized programs, building a progressively deepening library of abstractions capturing the structure of the input domain. We evaluate on eight domains including classic program synthesis areas and AI tasks such as planning, inverse graphics, and equation discovery. We show that jointly learning the library and neural search policy leads to solving more problems, and solving them more quickly.},

abstract = {Many stochastic planning problems can be represented using Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). A difficulty with using these MDP representations is that the common algorithms for solving them run in time polynomial in the size of the state space, where this size is extremely large for most real-world planning problems of interest. Recent AI research has addressed this problem by representing the MDP in a factored form. Factored MDPs, however, are not amenable to traditional solution methods that call for an explicit enumeration of the state space. One familiar way to solve MDP problems with very large state spaces is to form a reduced (or aggregated) MDP with the same properties as the original MDP by combining ‚Äúequivalent‚Äù states. In this paper, we discuss applying this approach to solving factored MDP problems‚Äîwe avoid enumerating the state space by describing large blocks of ‚Äúequivalent‚Äù states in factored form, with the block descriptions being inferred directly from the original factored representation. The resulting reduced MDP may have exponentially fewer states than the original factored MDP, and can then be solved using traditional methods. The reduced MDP found depends on the notion of equivalence between states used in the aggregation. The notion of equivalence chosen will be fundamental in designing and analyzing algorithms for reducing MDPs. Optimally, these algorithms will be able to find the smallest possible reduced MDP for any given input MDP and notion of equivalence (i.e., find the ‚Äúminimal model‚Äù for the input MDP). Unfortunately, the classic notion of state equivalence from non-deterministic finite state machines generalized to MDPs does not prove useful. We present here a notion of equivalence that is based upon the notion of bisimulation from the literature on concurrent processes. Our generalization of bisimulation to stochastic processes yields a non-trivial notion of state equivalence that guarantees the optimal policy for the reduced model immediately induces a corresponding optimal policy for the original model. With this notion of state equivalence, we design and analyze an algorithm that minimizes arbitrary factored MDPs and compare this method analytically to previous algorithms for solving factored MDPs. We show that previous approaches implicitly derive equivalence relations that we define here.}

abstract = {High-level actions (HLAs) lie at the heart of hierarchical planning. Typically, an HLA admits multiple refinements into primitive action sequences. Correct descriptions of the effects of HLAs may be essential to their effective use, yet the literature is mostly silent. We propose an angelic semantics for HLAs, the key concept of which is the set of states reachable by some refinement of a high-level plan, representing uncertainty that will ultimately be resolved in the planning agent's own best interest. We describe upper and lower approximations to these reachable sets, and show that the resulting definition of a high-level solution automatically satisfies the upward and downward refinement properties. We define a STRIPS-like notation for such descriptions. A sound and complete hierarchical planning algorithm is given and its computational benefits are demonstrated.},

Since the program for a single task is underdetermined by its data, we introduce a nonparametric hierarchical Bayesian prior over programs which shares statistical strength across multiple tasks. The key challenge is to parametrize this multi-task sharing. For this, we introduce a new representation of programs based on combinatory logic and provide an MCMC algorithm that can perform safe program transformations on this representation to reveal shared inter-program substructures.},

abstract = {How should a machine intelligence perform unsupervised structure discovery over streams of sensory input? One approach to this problem is to cast it as an apperception task [1]. Here, the task is to construct an explicit interpretable theory that both explains the sensory sequence and also satisfies a set of unity conditions, designed to ensure that the constituents of the theory are connected in a relational structure. However, the original formulation of the apperception task had one fundamental limitation: it assumed the raw sensory input had already been parsed using a set of discrete categories, so that all the system had to do was receive this already-digested symbolic input, and make sense of it. But what if we don't have access to pre-parsed input? What if our sensory sequence is raw unprocessed information? The central contribution of this paper is a neuro-symbolic framework for distilling interpretable theories out of streams of raw, unprocessed sensory experience. First, we extend the definition of the apperception task to include ambiguous (but still symbolic) input: sequences of sets of disjunctions. Next, we use a neural network to map raw sensory input to disjunctive input. Our binary neural network is encoded as a logic program, so the weights of the network and the rules of the theory can be solved jointly as a single SAT problem. This way, we are able to jointly learn how to perceive (mapping raw sensory information to concepts) and apperceive (combining concepts into declarative rules).}

The key novelty is to iterate between a functional synthesis step, which attempts to generate a transition function over observed states, and an automata synthesis step, which adds any additional latent state necessary to fully account for the observations. We develop a functional reactive DSL called Autumn that can express a rich variety of causal dynamics in time-varying, Atari-style grid worlds, and apply our method to synthesize Autumn programs from data. We evaluate our algorithm on a benchmark suite of 30 Autumn programs as well as a third-party corpus of grid-world-style video games. We find that our algorithm synthesizes 27 out of 30 programs in our benchmark suite and 21 out of 27 programs from the third-party corpus, including several programs describing complex latent state transformations, and from input traces containing hundreds of observations. We expect that our approach will provide a template for how to integrate functional and automata synthesis in other induction domains.},

abstract = {We present a method for example-guided synthesis of functional programs over recursive data structures. Given a set of input-output examples, our method synthesizes a program in a functional language with higher-order combinators like map and fold. The synthesized program is guaranteed to be the simplest program in the language to fit the examples. Our approach combines three technical ideas: inductive generalization, deduction, and enumerative search. First, we generalize the input-output examples into hypotheses about the structure of the target program. For each hypothesis, we use deduction to infer new input/output examples for the missing subexpressions. This leads to a new subproblem where the goal is to synthesize expressions within each hypothesis. Since not every hypothesis can be realized into a program that fits the examples, we use a combination of best-first enumeration and deduction to search for a hypothesis that meets our needs. We have implemented our method in a tool called Œª2, and we evaluate this tool on a large set of synthesis problems involving lists, trees, and nested data structures. The experiments demonstrate the scalability and broad scope of Œª2. A highlight is the synthesis of a program believed to be the world's earliest functional pearl.},
