Ensuring adequate but safe exploration is also crucial for controlling physical systems. In this paper, we use temporal logic to facilitate speciﬁcation and learning of complex tasks. We combine temporal logic with control Lyapunov functions to improve exploration. We incorporate control barrier functions to safeguard the exploration and deployment process. We develop a ﬂexible and learnable system that allows users to specify task objectives and constraints in different forms and at various levels.

	abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) agents need to explore their environments in order to learn optimal policies by trial and error. In many environments, safety is a critical concern and certain errors are unacceptable: for example, robotics systems that interact with humans should never cause injury to the humans while exploring. While it is currently typical to train RL agents mostly or entirely in simulation, where safety concerns are minimal, we anticipate that challenges in simulating the complexities of the real world (such as human-AI interactions) will cause a shift towards training RL agents directly in the real world, where safety concerns are paramount. Consequently we take the position that safe exploration should be viewed as a critical focus area for RL research, and in this work we make three contributions to advance the study of safe exploration. First, building on a wide range of prior work on safe reinforcement learning, we propose to standardize constrained RL as the main formalism for safe exploration. Second, we present the Safety Gym benchmark suite, a new slate of high-dimensional continuous control environments for measuring research progress on constrained RL. Finally, we benchmark several constrained deep RL algorithms on Safety Gym environments to establish baselines that future work can build on.},

Existing formal methods for learning and optimization primarily consider the problem of constrained learning or constrained optimization.

Acting well given an accurate environmental model is an important pre-requisite for safe learning, but is ultimately insuﬃcient for systems that operate in complex heterogeneous environments. This paper introduces veriﬁcation-preserving model updates, the ﬁrst approach toward obtaining formal safety guarantees for reinforcement learning in settings where multiple possible environmental models must be taken into account.

	abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) is a general method for learning optimal policies through exploration and experience. Although impressive results have been achieved with RL in recent years, particularly in the domain of video games, RL has been predominantly used in systems with both discrete environments and agents. A key barrier to using RL in safety-criftical cyber-physical system applications is the difficulty of ensuring their safety while enabling learning. This paper presents a framework called FoRShield for learning safe policies for control systems with nonlinear continuous dynamics. A generic hybrid systems model of a control system using online RL is developed. This model is then used to formalize the notion of a shield that can filter unsafe action choices and provide feedback to the learning system. A concrete approach for computing the shield is presented using existing hybrid reachability analysis tools. Finally, to illustrate the feasibility of the approach, a substantial case study is presented involving a quadcopter that uses RL to plan for a dynamic fire-fighting task. The implementation of the approach shows that interesting fire-fighting strategies can be safely learned for discrete environment with 232 states and a 9-dimensional plant model using a standard laptop computer. 1},

	Traditional exploration techniques are not particularly useful for solving

	arises; namely, that of how to avoid (or at least minimize) damage caused by
	the exploration of the state-action space. We introduce the PI-SRL algorithm
	which safely improves suboptimal albeit robust behaviors for continuous state
	and action control tasks and which efficiently learns from the experience

	abstract = {Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have demonstrated remarkable utility in a variety of challenging machine learning applications. However, their complex architecture makes asserting any formal guarantees about their behavior difficult. Existing approaches to this problem typically consider verification as a post facto white-box process, one that reasons about the safety of an existing network through exploration of its internal structure, rather than via a methodology that ensures the network is correct-by-construction. In this paper, we present a novel learning framework that takes an important first step towards realizing such a methodology. Our technique enables the construction of provably correct networks with respect to a broad class of safety properties, a capability that goes well-beyond existing approaches. Overcoming the challenge of general safety property enforcement within the network training process in a supervised learning pipeline, however, requires a fundamental shift in how we architect and build ANNs. Our key insight is that we can integrate an optimization-based abstraction refinement loop into the learning process that iteratively splits the input space from which training data is drawn, based on the efficacy with which such a partition enables safety verification. To do so, our approach enables training to take place over an abstraction of a concrete network that operates over dynamically constructed partitions of the input space. We provide theoretical results that show that classical gradient descent methods used to optimize these networks can be seamlessly adopted to this framework to ensure soundness of our approach. Moreover, we empirically demonstrate that realizing soundness does not come at the price of accuracy, giving us a meaningful pathway for building both precise and correct networks.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider the problem of formally verifying the safety of an autonomous robot equipped with a Neural Network (NN) controller that processes LiDAR images to produce control actions. Given a workspace that is characterized by a set of polytopic obstacles, our objective is to compute the set of safe initial conditions such that a robot trajectory starting from these initial conditions is guaranteed to avoid the obstacles. Our approach is to construct a finite state abstraction of the system and use standard reachability analysis over the finite state abstraction to compute the set of the safe initial states. The first technical problem in computing the finite state abstraction is to mathematically model the imaging function that maps the robot position to the LiDAR image. To that end, we introduce the notion of imaging-adapted sets as partitions of the workspace in which the imaging function is guaranteed to be affine. We develop a polynomial-time algorithm to partition the workspace into imaging-adapted sets along with computing the corresponding affine imaging functions. Given this workspace partitioning, a discrete-time linear dynamics of the robot, and a pre-trained NN controller with Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) nonlinearity, the second technical challenge is to analyze the behavior of the neural network. To that end, we utilize a Satisfiability Modulo Convex (SMC) encoding to enumerate all the possible segments of different ReLUs. SMC solvers then use a Boolean satisfiability solver and a convex programming solver and decompose the problem into smaller subproblems. To accelerate this process, we develop a pre-processing algorithm that could rapidly prune the space feasible ReLU segments. Finally, we demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms using numerical simulations with increasing complexity of the neural network controller.},

Although techniques exist for verifying input/output properties of the neural network itself, these methods cannot be used to verify properties of the closed-loop system (since they work with piecewise-linear constraints that do not capture non-linear plant dynamics). To overcome this challenge, we focus on sigmoid-based networks and exploit the fact that the sigmoid is the solution to a quadratic differential equation, which allows us to transform the neural network into an equivalent hybrid system. By composing the network's hybrid system with the plant's, we transform the problem into a hybrid system verification problem which can be solved using state-of-the-art reachability tools. We show that reachability is decidable for networks with one hidden layer and decidable for general networks if Schanuel's conjecture is true. We evaluate the applicability and scalability of Verisig in two case studies, one from reinforcement learning and one in which the neural network is used to approximate a model predictive controller.},
