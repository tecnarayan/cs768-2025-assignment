	Abstract = {This article is concerned with predicting for Gaussian random fields in a way that appropriately deals with uncertainty in the covariance function. To this end, we analyze the best linear unbiased prediction procedure within a Bayesian framework. Particular attention is paid to the treatment of parameters in the covariance structure and their effect on the quality, both real and perceived, of the prediction. These ideas are implemented using topographical data from Davis.},

Firstly, we provide a thresholding scheme which allows approximating the support of a measure from a finite subset of its moments with strong asymptotic guaranties. Secondly, we provide a consistency result which relates the empirical Christoffel function and its population counterpart in the limit of large samples. Finally, we illustrate the relevance of our results on simulated and real-world datasets for several applications in statistics and machine learning: (a) density and support estimation from finite samples, (b) outlier and novelty detection, and (c) affine matching.},

	Abstract = {Given a matrix $\mathbf{A}\in\R^{n\times d}$ and a vector $b\in\R^{d}$, we show how to compute an $\epsilon$-approximate solution to the regression problem  $ \min_{x\in\R^{d}}\frac{1}{2} \norm{\mathbf{A} x-b}_{2}^{2} $ in time $ \widetilde{O} ((n+\sqrt{d\cdot\kappa_{\text{sum}}}) s \log\epsilon^{-1}) $ where $\kappa_{\text{sum}}=\tr\left(\mathbf{A}^{\top}\mathbf{A}\right)/\lambda_{\min}(\mathbf{A}^{\top}\mathbf{A})$ and $s$ is the maximum number of non-zero entries in a row of $\mathbf{A}$. This improves upon the previous best running time of  $ \widetilde{O} ((n+\sqrt{n \cdot\kappa_{\text{sum}}}) s \log\epsilon^{-1})$. We achieve our result through an interesting combination of leverage score sampling, proximal point methods, and accelerated coordinate descent methods. Further, we show that our method not only matches the performance of previous methods up to polylogarithmic factors, but further improves whenever leverage scores of rows are small. We also provide a non-linear generalization of these results that improves the running time for solving a broader class of ERM problems and expands the set of ERM problems provably solvable in nearly linear time.},

	Abstract = {Finding suitable points for multivariate polynomial interpolation and approximation is a challenging task. Yet, despite this challenge, there has been tremendous research dedicated to this singular cause. In this paper, we begin by reviewing classical methods for finding suitable quadrature points for polynomial approximation in both the univariate and multivariate setting. Then, we categorize recent advances into those that propose a new sampling approach, and those centered on an optimization strategy. The sampling approaches yield a favorable discretization of the domain, while the optimization methods pick a subset of the discretized samples that minimize certain objectives. While not all strategies follow this two-stage approach, most do. Sampling techniques covered include subsampling quadratures, Christoffel, induced and Monte Carlo methods. Optimization methods discussed range from linear programming ideas and Newton's method to greedy procedures from numerical linear algebra. Our exposition is aided by examples that implement some of the aforementioned strategies.},

@article{HamptonDoostan:2015,
	Abstract = {Independent sampling of orthogonal polynomial bases via Monte Carlo is of interest for uncertainty quantification of models using Polynomial Chaos (PC) expansions. It is known that bounding the spectral radius of a random matrix consisting of PC samples yields a bound on the number of samples necessary to identify coefficients in the PC expansion via solution to a least squares regression problem. We present a related analysis which guarantees a mean square convergence using a coherence parameter of the sampled PC basis that may be both analytically bounded and computationally estimated. Utilizing asymptotic results for orthogonal polynomials, we bound the coherence parameter for polynomials of Hermite and Legendre type under each respective natural sampling distribution. In both polynomial bases we identify an importance sampling distribution which yields a bound with weaker dependence on the order of the PC basis. For more general orthonormal bases, we propose the coherence-optimal sampling: a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling, which directly uses the basis functions under consideration to achieve a statistical optimality among all such sampling schemes with identical support, and which guarantees recovery with a number of samples that is, up to a logarithmic factor, linear in the number of basis functions considered. We demonstrate these different sampling strategies numerically in both high-order and high-dimensional manufactured PC expansions. In addition, the quality of each sampling method is compared in the identification of solutions to two differential equations, one with a high-dimensional random input and the other with a high-order PC expansion. In all observed cases the coherence-optimal sampling leads to similar or considerably improved accuracy over the other considered sampling distributions.},
