	abstract = {Local graph clustering methods aim to find a cluster of nodes by exploring a small region of the graph. These methods are attractive because they enable targeted clustering around a given seed node and are faster than traditional global graph clustering methods because their runtime does not depend on the size of the input graph. However, current local graph partitioning methods are not designed to account for the higher-order structures crucial to the network, nor can they effectively handle directed networks. Here we introduce a new class of local graph clustering methods that address these issues by incorporating higher-order network information captured by small subgraphs, also called network motifs. We develop the Motif-based Approximate Personalized PageRank (MAPPR) algorithm that finds clusters containing a seed node with minimal emph{motif conductance}, a generalization of the conductance metric for network motifs. We generalize existing theory to prove the fast running time (independent of the size of the graph) and obtain theoretical guarantees on the cluster quality (in terms of motif conductance). We also develop a theory of node neighborhoods for finding sets that have small motif conductance, and apply these results to the case of finding good seed nodes to use as input to the MAPPR algorithm. Experimental validation on community detection tasks in both synthetic and real-world networks, shows that our new framework MAPPR outperforms the current edge-based personalized PageRank methodology.},

	abstract = {Hypergraph-based machine learning methods are now widely recognized as important for modeling and using higher-order and multiway relationships between data objects. Local hypergraph clustering and semi-supervised learning specifically involve finding a well-connected set of nodes near a given set of labeled vertices. Although many methods for local graph clustering exist, there are relatively few for localized clustering in hypergraphs. Moreover, those that exist often lack flexibility to model a general class of hypergraph cut functions or cannot scale to large problems. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a new diffusion-based hypergraph clustering algorithm that solves a quadratic hypergraph cut based objective akin to a hypergraph analog of Andersen-Chung-Lang personalized PageRank clustering for graphs. We prove that, for graphs with fixed maximum hyperedge size, this method is strongly local, meaning that its runtime only depends on the size of the output instead of the size of the hypergraph and is highly scalable. Moreover, our method enables us to compute with a wide variety of cardinality-based hypergraph cut functions. We also prove that the clusters found by solving the new objective function satisfy a Cheeger-like quality guarantee. We demonstrate that on large real-world hypergraphs our new method finds better clusters and runs much faster than existing approaches. Specifically, it runs in a few seconds for hypergraphs with a few million hyperedges compared with minutes for a flow-based technique. We furthermore show that our framework is general enough that can also be used to solve other p-norm based cut objectives on hypergraphs. },

This article is focused on generative models of large-scale bipartite graphs, also known as two-way graphs or two-mode networks. We propose two generative models that can be easily tuned to reproduce the characteristics of real-world networks, not just qualitatively but quantitatively. The characteristics we consider are the degree distributions and the metamorphosis coefficient. The metamorphosis coefficient, a bipartite analogue of the clustering coefficient, is the proportion of length-three paths that participate in length-four cycles. Having a high metamorphosis coefficient is a necessary condition for close-knit community structure. We define edge, node and degreewise metamorphosis coefficients, enabling a more detailed understanding of the bipartite connectivity that is not explained by degree distribution alone. Our first model, bipartite Chung–Lu, is able to reproduce real-world degree distributions, and our second model, bipartite block two-level Erdös–Rényi, reproduces both the degree distributions as well as the degreewise metamorphosis coefficients. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these models on several real-world data sets.}",

For the case of β \&gt; 3, we prove that the average distance of the power law graphs is almost surely of order log n/log d̃. However, many Internet, social, and citation networks are power law graphs with exponents in the range 2 \&lt; β \&lt; 3 for which the power law random graphs have average distance almost surely of order log log n, but have diameter of order log n (provided having some mild constraints for the average distance and maximum degree). In particular, these graphs contain a dense subgraph, which we call the core, having nc/log log n vertices. Almost all vertices are within distance log log n of the core although there are vertices at distance log n from the core.},

This question has been considered within several different contexts in computer science, including computer vision, artificial intelligence, and pseudo-Boolean optimisation. Using a connection between the expressive power of valued constraints and certain algebraic properties of functions, we answer this question negatively.",

Besides a new vertex added in at every time step, old vertices can also attempt to build up new links, or to reconnect the existing links. The number of connections repeated between two nodes is converted into the weight of the link. This provides a natural way for the evolution of link weight. The path-dependent preferential attachment mechanism with local information is also introduced. It increases the clustering coefficient of the network significantly. The model shows the scale-free phenomena in degree and vertex weight distribution. It also gives well qualitatively consistent behavior with the empirical results."

Cutsets of hypergraphs are defined in a natural way, and it is shown that optimal cutsets can be found by means of a network flow computation. The optimal cutset computation can be used to generate a family of subsets of nodes, which we call LS sets. Intuitively, an LS set is a subset of nodes that are more strongly connected to each other than to nodes in the complementary set. LS sets are useful for constructing optimal or near-optimal partitions of the nodes. A polynomial-bounded partitioning algorithm is presented, and various applications are suggested.},

Our algorithm has important theoretical properties, such as convergence and satisfaction of first order necessary optimality conditions. It is based on an efficient iterative procedure, which by updating the cluster membership of all points in parallel, is able to achieve state of the art results in very few steps. We outperform current hypergraph clustering methods especially in terms of computational speed, but also in terms of accuracy. Moreover, we show that our method could be successfully applied both to higher-order assignment problems and to image segmentation.},

We introduce and analyze a new method for locally-biased graph-based learning called SimpleLocal, which finds good conductance cuts near a set of seed vertices. An important feature of our algorithm is that it is strongly-local, meaning it does not need to explore the entire graph to find cuts that are locally optimal. This method is related to other strongly-local flow-based methods, but it enables a simple implementation. We also show how it achieves localization through an implicit l1-norm penalty term. As a flow-based method, our algorithm exhibits several advantages in terms of cut optimality and accurate identification of target regions in a graph. We demonstrate the power of SimpleLocal solving segmentation problems on a 467 million edge graph based on an MRI scan.},

These approximations are compared with other known approximations and yield promising results.},

Of course such models have to simulate the given hypergraphs with respect to their cut properties. An edge-weighted graph (V, E) is a cut-model for an edge-weighted hypergraph (V, H) if the weight of the edges cut by any bipartition of V in the graph is the same as the weight of the hyperedges cut by the same bipartition in the hypergraph. We show that there is no cut-model in general. Next we examine whether the addition of dummy vertices helps: An edge-weighted graph (V ∪ D, E) is a mincut-model for an edge-weighted hypergraph (V, H) if the weight of the hyperedges cut by a bipartition of the hypergraphs vertices is the same as the weight of a minimum cut separating the two parts in the graph. We construct such models using positive and negative weights. On the other hand, we show that there is no mincut-model in general if only positive weights are allowed.},

We review the many definitions for what is a cluster in a graph and measures of cluster quality. Then we present global algorithms for producing a clustering for the entire vertex set of an input graph, after which we discuss the task of identifying a cluster for a specific seed vertex by local computation. Some ideas on the application areas of graph clustering algorithms are given. We also address the problematics of evaluating clusterings and benchmarking cluster algorithms.},
