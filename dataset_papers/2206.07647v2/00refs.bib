	abstract = {There is large consent that successful training of deep networks requires many thousand annotated training samples. In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU. The full implementation (based on Caffe) and the trained networks are available at http://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net.},

	abstract = {In data mining, anomaly detection aims at identifying the observations which do not conform to an expected behavior. To date, a large number of techniques for anomaly detection have been proposed and developed. These techniques have been successfully applied to many real world applications such as fraud detection for credit cards and intrusion detection in network security. However, there are very little research relating to the method for evaluating the goodness of unsupervised anomaly detection techniques. In this paper, the authors introduce a method for evaluating the performance of unsupervised anomaly detection techniques. The method is based on the application of internal validation metrics in clustering algorithms to anomaly detection. The experiments were conducted on a number of benchmarking datasets. The results are compared with the result of a recent proposed approach that shows that some proposed metrics are very consistent when being used to evaluate the performance of unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms. },

	abstract = {We present a novel approach to low-level vision problems that combines sparse coding and deep networks pre-trained with denoising auto-encoder (DA). We propose an alternative training scheme that successfully adapts DA, originally designed for unsupervised feature learning, to the tasks of image denoising and blind inpainting. Our method's performance in the image denoising task is comparable to that of KSVD which is a widely used sparse coding technique. More importantly, in blind image inpainting task, the proposed method provides solutions to some complex problems that have not been tackled before. Specifically, we can automatically remove complex patterns like superimposed text from an image, rather than simple patterns like pixels missing at random. Moreover, the proposed method does not need the information regarding the region that requires inpainting to be given a priori. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in the tasks of image denoising and blind inpainting. We also show that our new training scheme for DA is more effective and can improve the performance of unsupervised feature learning.},
