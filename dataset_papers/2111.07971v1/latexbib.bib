  abstract = 	 {In this paper, we propose a new theoretical analysis of unsupervised domain adaptation that relates notions of large margin separation, adversarial learning and optimal transport. This analysis generalizes previous work on the subject by providing a bound on the target margin violation rate, thus reflecting a better control of the quality of separation between classes in the target domain than bounding the misclassification rate. The bound also highlights the benefit of a large margin separation on the source domain for adaptation and introduces an optimal transport (OT) based distance between domains that has the virtue of being task-dependent, contrary to other approaches. From the obtained theoretical results, we derive a novel algorithmic solution for domain adaptation that introduces a novel shallow OT-based adversarial approach and outperforms other OT-based DA baselines on several simulated and real-world classification tasks.}

@inproceedings{zhang19bridging,
  Abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of unsupervised domain adaption from theoretical and algorithmic perspectives. Existing domain adaptation theories naturally imply minimax optimization algorithms, which connect well with the domain adaptation methods based on adversarial learning. However, several disconnections still exist and form the gap between theory and algorithm. We extend previous theories (Mansour et al., 2009c; Ben-David et al., 2010) to multiclass classification in domain adaptation, where classifiers based on the scoring functions and margin loss are standard choices in algorithm design. We introduce Margin Disparity Discrepancy, a novel measurement with rigorous generalization bounds, tailored to the distribution comparison with the asymmetric margin loss, and to the minimax optimization for easier training. Our theory can be seamlessly transformed into an adversarial learning algorithm for domain adaptation, successfully bridging the gap between theory and algorithm. A series of empirical studies show that our algorithm achieves the state of the art accuracies on challenging domain adaptation tasks.},

  abstract = 	 {Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) are commonly developed at a fixed resource budget, and then scaled up for better accuracy if more resources are given. In this paper, we systematically study model scaling and identify that carefully balancing network depth, width, and resolution can lead to better performance. Based on this observation, we propose a new scaling method that uniformly scales all dimensions of depth/width/resolution using a simple yet highly effective compound coefficient. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on MobileNets and ResNet. To go even further, we use neural architecture search to design a new baseline network and scale it up to obtain a family of models, called EfficientNets, which achieve much better accuracy and efficiency than previous ConvNets. In particular, our EfficientNet-B7 achieves stateof-the-art 84.4% top-1 / 97.1% top-5 accuracy on ImageNet, while being 8.4x smaller and 6.1x faster on inference than the best existing ConvNet (Huang et al., 2018). Our EfficientNets also transfer well and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on CIFAR-100 (91.7%), Flower (98.8%), and 3 other transfer learning datasets, with an order of magnitude fewer parameters.}

@misc{adam,
  abstract = {We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization
of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order
moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally
efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling
of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of
data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary
objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The
hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little
tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are
discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the
algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable
to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework.
Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares
favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax,
a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},
