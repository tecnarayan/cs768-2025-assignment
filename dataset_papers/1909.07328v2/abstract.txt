Human reasoning involves recognising common underlying principles across many
examples. The by-products of such reasoning are invariants that capture
patterns such as "if someone went somewhere then they are there", expressed
using variables "someone" and "somewhere" instead of mentioning specific people
or places. Humans learn what variables are and how to use them at a young age.
This paper explores whether machines can also learn and use variables solely
from examples without requiring human pre-engineering. We propose Unification
Networks, an end-to-end differentiable neural network approach capable of
lifting examples into invariants and using those invariants to solve a given
task. The core characteristic of our architecture is soft unification between
examples that enables the network to generalise parts of the input into
variables, thereby learning invariants. We evaluate our approach on five
datasets to demonstrate that learning invariants captures patterns in the data
and can improve performance over baselines.
