For Example, What Can Such Deep Networks Compute? How Can We Train Them? How Does Information Propagate Through Them? Why Can They Generalize? And How Can We Teach Them To Imagine? We Review Recent Work In Which Methods Of Physical Analysis Rooted In Statistical Mechanics Have Begun To Provide Conceptual Insights Into These Questions. These Insights Yield Connections Between Deep Learning And Diverse Physical And Mathematical Topics, Including Random Landscapes, Spin Glasses, Jamming, Dynamical Phase Transitions, Chaos, Riemannian Geometry, Random Matrix Theory, Free Probability, And Nonequilibrium Statistical Mechanics. Indeed, The Fields Of Statistical Mechanics And Machine Learning Have Long Enjoyed A Rich History Of Strongly Coupled Interactions, And Recent Advances At The Intersection Of Statistical Mechanics And Deep Learning Suggest These Interactions Will Only Deepen Going Forward.},

@article{electronics9091363,
  abstract       = {Driven By The Recent Technological Advancements Within The Field Of Artificial Intelligence Research, Deep Learning Has Emerged As A Promising Representation Learning Technique Across All Of The Machine Learning Classes, Especially Within The Reinforcement Learning Arena. This New Direction Has Given Rise To The Evolution Of A New Technological Domain Named Deep Reinforcement Learning, Which Combines The Representational Learning Power Of Deep Learning With Existing Reinforcement Learning Methods. Undoubtedly, The Inception Of Deep Reinforcement Learning Has Played A Vital Role In Optimizing The Performance Of Reinforcement Learning-based Intelligent Agents With Model-free Based Approaches. Although These Methods Could Improve The Performance Of Agents To A Greater Extent, They Were Mainly Limited To Systems That Adopted Reinforcement Learning Algorithms Focused On Learning A Single Task. At The Same Moment, The Aforementioned Approach Was Found To Be Relatively Data-inefficient, Particularly When Reinforcement Learning Agents Needed To Interact With More Complex And Rich Data Environments. This Is Primarily Due To The Limited Applicability Of Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms To Many Scenarios Across Related Tasks From The Same Environment. The Objective Of This Paper Is To Survey The Research Challenges Associated With Multi-tasking Within The Deep Reinforcement Arena And Present The State-of-the-art Approaches By Comparing And Contrasting Recent Solutions, Namely Distral (distill \&amp; Transfer Learning), Impala(importance Weighted Actor-learner Architecture) And Popart That Aim To Address Core Challenges Such As Scalability, Distraction Dilemma, Partial Observability, Catastrophic Forgetting And Negative Knowledge Transfer.},

  abstract   = {Multilayer Neural Networks Are Among The Most Powerful Models In Machine Learning, Yet The Fundamental Reasons For This Success Defy Mathematical Understanding. Learning A Neural Network Requires Optimizing A Nonconvex High-dimensional Objective (risk Function), A Problem That Is Usually Attacked Using Stochastic Gradient Descent (sgd). Does Sgd Converge To A Global Optimum Of The Risk Or Only To A Local Optimum? In The Former Case, Does This Happen Because Local Minima Are Absent Or Because Sgd Somehow Avoids Them? In The Latter, Why Do Local Minima Reached By Sgd Have Good Generalization Properties? In This Paper, We Consider A Simple Case, Namely Two-layer Neural Networks, And Prove That--in A Suitable Scaling Limit--sgd Dynamics Is Captured By A Certain Nonlinear Partial Differential Equation (pde) That We Call Distributional Dynamics (dd). We Then Consider Several Specific Examples And Show How Dd Can Be Used To Prove Convergence Of Sgd To Networks With Nearly Ideal Generalization Error. This Description Allows For ``averaging Out'' Some Of The Complexities Of The Landscape Of Neural Networks And Can Be Used To Prove A General Convergence Result For Noisy Sgd.},

We Address This Question By Mathematically Analyzing The Nonlinear Dynamics Of Learning In Deep Linear Networks. We Find Exact Solutions To This Learning Dynamics That Yield A Conceptual Explanation For The Prevalence Of Many Disparate Phenomena In Semantic Cognition, Including The Hierarchical Differentiation Of Concepts Through Rapid Developmental Transitions, The Ubiquity Of Semantic Illusions Between Such Transitions, The Emergence Of Item Typicality And Category Coherence As Factors Controlling The Speed Of Semantic Processing, Changing Patterns Of Inductive Projection Over Development, And The Conservation Of Semantic Similarity In Neural Representations Across Species. Thus, Surprisingly, Our Simple Neural Model Qualitatively Recapitulates Many Diverse Regularities Underlying Semantic Development, While Providing Analytic Insight Into How The Statistical Structure Of An Environment Can Interact With Nonlinear Deep-learning Dynamics To Give Rise To These Regularities.},

Our Result Describes The Neural Network's Fluctuations Around Its Mean-field Limit. The Fluctuations Have A Gaussian Distribution And Satisfy A Stochastic Partial Differential Equation. The Proof Relies Upon Weak Convergence Methods From Stochastic Analysis. In Particular, We Prove Relative Compactness For The Sequence Of Processes And Uniqueness Of The Limiting Process In A Suitable Sobolev Space.},
