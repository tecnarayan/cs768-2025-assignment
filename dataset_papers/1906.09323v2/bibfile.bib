    We describe an approach to domain adaptation that is appropriate
    exactly in the case when one has enough ``target'' data to do slightly
    better than just using only ``source'' data.  Our approach is
    incredibly simple, easy to implement as a preprocessing step (10 lines
    of Perl!) and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on a range of
    datasets.  The technique comes with several simple theoretical
    guarantees.  Moreover, it is trivially extended to a multi-domain
    adaptation problem, where one has data from a variety of different
    domains.

     In this paper, we explore a streaming algorithm paradigm to handle
     large amounts of data for NLP problems. We present an efficient
     low-memory method for constructing high-order approximate n-gram
     frequency counts. The method is based on a deterministic streaming
     algorithm which efficiently computes approximate frequency counts
     over a stream of data while employing a small memory footprint. We
     show that this method easily scales to billion-word monolingual
     corpora using a conventional (4 GB RAM) desktop
     machine. Statistical machine translation experimental results
     corroborate that the resulting high-n approximate small language
     model is as effective as models obtained from other count pruning
     methods.

   abstract = {
     We present a streaming model for large-scale classification
     (in the context of l2-SVM) by leveraging
     connections between learning and computational
     geometry. The streaming model imposes the constraint
     that only a single pass over the data is allowed.
     The l2-SVMis known to have an equivalent
     formulation in terms of theminimumenclosing ball
     (MEB) problem, and an efficient algorithm based
     on the idea of core sets exists (CVM) [Tsang et al.,
     2005]. CVM learns a (1+ε)-approximate MEB for
     a set of points and yields an approximate solution
     to corresponding SVM instance. However CVM
     works in batch mode requiringmultiple passes over
     the data. This paper presents a single-pass SVM
     which is based on the minimum enclosing ball of
     streaming data. We show that the MEB updates for
     the streaming case can be easily adapted to learn the
     SVM weight vector in a way similar to using online
     stochastic gradient updates. Our algorithmperforms
     polylogarithmic computation at each example,
     and requires very small and constant storage.
     Experimental results show that, even in such restrictive
     settings, we can learn efficiently in just one
     pass and get accuracies comparable to other stateof-
     the-art SVM solvers (batch and online). We also
     give an analysis of the algorithm, and discuss some
     open issues and possible extensions.

  abstract = {We consider the problem of computing a lightest
                  derivation of a global structure using a set of
                  weighted rules. A large variety of inference
                  problems in AI can be formulated in this
                  framework. We generalize A* search and heuristics
                  derived from abstractions to a broad class of
                  lightest derivation problems. We also describe a new
                  algorithm that searches for lightest derivations
                  using a hierarchy of abstractions. Our
                  generalization of A* gives a new algorithm for
                  searching AND/OR graphs in a bottom-up fashion.
                     We discuss how the algorithms described here provide a general
                  architecture for addressing the pipeline problem ---
                  the problem of passing information back and forth
                  between various stages of processing in a perceptual
                  system. We consider examples in computer vision and
                  natural language processing. We apply the
                  hierarchical search algorithm to the problem of
                  estimating the boundaries of convex objects in
                  grayscale images and compare it to other search
                  methods. A second set of experiments demonstrate the
                  use of a new compositional model for finding salient
                  curves in images.}

  abstract = {Best-first parsing methods for natural language try
                  to parse efficiently by considering the most likely
                  constituents first. Some figure of merit is needed
                  by which to compare the likelihood of constituents,
                  and the choice of this figure has a substantial
                  impact on the efficiency of the parser. While
                  several parsers described in the literature have
                  used such techniques, there is little published data
                  on their efficacy, much less attempts to judge their
                  relative merits. We propose and evaluate several
                  figures of merit for best-first parsing, and we
                  identify an easily-computable figure of merit which
                  provides excellent performance on various measures
                  and two different grammars.}

@article{singer07inference,
  title={Inference processing in discourse comprehension},
  author={Singer, Murray},
  year={2007},
  journal={The Oxford Handbook of Psycholinguistics},
  abstract={Discourse understanding has been systematically studied within the framework of modern cognitive psychology for fewer than forty years. The inferences that accompany discourse comprehension have been a central focus of this field. One reason for this is that virtually every aspect of language comprehension is inferential. This article describes inferential phenomena that involve augmenting explicitly stated discourse ideas with implied concepts and relations. The term “discourse” refers to coherent messages in either of these modalities. In practice, however, a majority of the research has scrutinised reading comprehension. It is also noted that researchers have inspected numerous genres of discourse, including narratives, expositions, recipes, instruction lists, and poetry. The article first discusses the construction-integration model of inference processing in discourse comprehension, coherence and its impact on inference processing, and elaborative inferences.}
