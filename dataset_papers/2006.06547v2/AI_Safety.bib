	abstract = {Some researchers have speculated that capable reinforcement learning (RL) agents pursuing misspeciﬁed objectives are often incentivized to seek resources and power in pursuit of those objectives. An agent seeking power is incentivized to behave in undesirable ways, including rationally preventing deactivation and correction. Others have voiced skepticism: humans seem idiosyncratic in their urges to power, which need not be present in the agents we design. We formalize a notion of power within the context of ﬁnite Markov decision processes (MDPs). With respect to a neutral class of reward function distributions, our results suggest that farsighted optimal policies tend to seek power over the environment.},

Often, even when the change to the world is relatively small an extensive relearning effort is required. The new system exploits strong features in the multi-dimensional function produced by reinforcement learning. The features generate a partitioning of the state space. The partition is represented {\textasciitilde}s a graph. This is used to index and compose functions stored in a case base to form a close approximation to the solution of the new task. The experimental results investigate one important example of a changing world, a new goal position. In this situation, there is close to a two orders of magnitude increase in learning rate over using a basic reinforcement learning algorithm.},

The success of this technique is attributed to the smoothness of the basis functions with respect to the state space geometry. This paper explores the properties of bases created from directed graphs which are a more natural ﬁt for expressing state connectivity. Digraphs capture the eﬀect of non-reversible MDPs whose value functions may not be smooth across adjacent states. We provide an analysis using the Dirichlet sum of the directed graph Laplacian to show how the smoothness of the basis functions is aﬀected by the graph’s invariant distribution. Experiments in discrete and continuous MDPs with nonreversible actions demonstrate a signiﬁcant improvement in the policies learned using directed graph bases.},

	abstract = {We investigate the dual approach to dynamic programming and reinforcement learning, based on maintaining an explicit representation of stationary distributions as opposed to value functions. A signiﬁcant advantage of the dual approach is that it allows one to exploit well developed techniques for representing, approximating and estimating probability distributions, without running the risks associated with divergent value function estimation. A second advantage is that some distinct algorithms for the average reward and discounted reward case in the primal become uniﬁed under the dual. In this paper, we present a modiﬁed dual of the standard linear program that guarantees a globally normalized state visit distribution is obtained. With this reformulation, we then derive novel dual forms of dynamic programming, including policy evaluation, policy iteration and value iteration. Moreover, we derive dual formulations of temporal difference learning to obtain new forms of Sarsa and Q-learning. Finally, we scale these techniques up to large domains by introducing approximation, and develop new approximate off-policy learning algorithms that avoid the divergence problems associated with the primal approach. We show that the dual view yields a viable alternative to standard value function based techniques and opens new avenues for solving dynamic programming and reinforcement learning problems.},

These arguments, while intuitively compelling, are primarily philosophical. In this paper, we provide formal models that demonstrate Omohundro’s thesis, thereby putting mathematical weight behind those intuitive claims.},

Narrow intelligence, the ability to solve a given particularly difﬁcult problem, has seen impressive recent development. Notable examples include self-driving cars, Go engines, image classiﬁers, and translators. Artiﬁcial General Intelligence (AGI) presents dangers that narrow intelligence does not: if something smarter than us across every domain were indifferent to our concerns, it would be an existential threat to humanity, just as we threaten many species despite no ill will. Even the theory of how to maintain the alignment of an AGI’s goals with our own has proven highly elusive. We present the ﬁrst algorithm we are aware of for asymptotically unambitious AGI, where “unambitiousness” includes not seeking arbitrary power. Thus, we identify an exception to the Instrumental Convergence Thesis, which is roughly that by default, an AGI would seek power, including over us.},

He explains the two systems that drive the way we think. System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. He exposes the extraordinary capabilities, and also the faults and biases, of fast thinking, and reveals the pervasive influence of intuitive impressions on our thoughts and behavior. He reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and our personal lives, and how we can use different techniques to guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble. This author's work has transformed cognitive psychology and launched the new fields of behavioral economics and happiness studies. In this book, he takes us on a tour of the mind and explains the two systems that drive the way we think and the way we make choices.},

Therefore, when an instance of an unseen class appears in the prediction stage, a robust classiﬁer should be able to tell that it is from an unseen class, instead of classifying it to be any known category. In this paper, adopting the idea of adversarial learning, we propose the ASG framework for open-category classiﬁcation. ASG generates positive and negative samples of seen categories in the unsupervised manner via an adversarial learning strategy. With the generated samples, ASG then learns to tell seen from unseen in the supervised manner. Experiments performed on several datasets show the effectiveness of ASG.},

	abstract = {Deep networks have produced signiﬁcant gains for various visual recognition problems, leading to high impact academic and commercial applications. Recent work in deep networks highlighted that it is easy to generate images that humans would never classify as a particular object class, yet networks classify such images high conﬁdence as that given class – deep network are easily fooled with images humans do not consider meaningful. The closed set nature of deep networks forces them to choose from one of the known classes leading to such artifacts. Recognition in the real world is open set, i.e. the recognition system should reject unknown/unseen classes at test time. We present a methodology to adapt deep networks for open set recognition, by introducing a new model layer, OpenMax, which estimates the probability of an input being from an unknown class. A key element of estimating the unknown probability is adapting Meta-Recognition concepts to the activation patterns in the penultimate layer of the network. OpenMax allows rejection of “fooling” and unrelated open set images presented to the system; OpenMax greatly reduces the number of obvious errors made by a deep network. We prove that the OpenMax concept provides bounded open space risk, thereby formally providing an open set recognition solution. We evaluate the resulting open set deep networks using pre-trained networks from the Caffe Model-zoo on ImageNet 2012 validation data, and thousands of fooling and open set images. The proposed OpenMax model significantly outperforms open set recognition accuracy of basic deep networks as well as deep networks with thresholding of SoftMax probabilities.},

	abstract = {To make AI systems broadly useful for challenging real-world tasks, we need them to learn complex human goals and preferences. One approach to specifying complex goals asks humans to judge during training which agent behaviors are safe and useful, but this approach can fail if the task is too complicated for a human to directly judge. To help address this concern, we propose training agents via self play on a zero sum debate game. Given a question or proposed action, two agents take turns making short statements up to a limit, then a human judges which of the agents gave the most true, useful information. In an analogy to complexity theory, debate with optimal play can answer any question in PSPACE given polynomial time judges (direct judging answers only NP questions). In practice, whether debate works involves empirical questions about humans and the tasks we want AIs to perform, plus theoretical questions about the meaning of AI alignment. We report results on an initial MNIST experiment where agents compete to convince a sparse classiﬁer, boosting the classiﬁer’s accuracy from 59.4\% to 88.9\% given 6 pixels and from 48.2\% to 85.2\% given 4 pixels. Finally, we discuss theoretical and practical aspects of the debate model, focusing on potential weaknesses as the model scales up, and we propose future human and computer experiments to test these properties.},

If such an agent is operating in real-time under human supervision, now and then it may be necessary for a human operator to press the big red button to prevent the agent from continuing a harmful sequence of actions—harmful either for the agent or for the environment—and lead the agent into a safer situation. However, if the learning agent expects to receive rewards from this sequence, it may learn in the long run to avoid such interruptions, for example by disabling the red button—which is an undesirable outcome. This paper explores a way to make sure a learning agent will not learn to prevent (or seek!) being interrupted by the environment or a human operator. We provide a formal deﬁnition of safe interruptibility and exploit the off-policy learning property to prove that either some agents are already safely interruptible, like Q-learning, or can easily be made so, like Sarsa. We show that even ideal, uncomputable reinforcement learning agents for (deterministic) general computable environments can be made safely interruptible.},

For example, a reinforcement learning agent may prefer states where a sensory error gives it the maximum reward, but where the true reward is actually small. We formalise this problem as a generalised Markov Decision Problem called Corrupt Reward MDP. Traditional RL methods fare poorly in CRMDPs, even under strong simplifying assumptions and when trying to compensate for the possibly corrupt rewards. Two ways around the problem are investigated. First, by giving the agent richer data, such as in inverse reinforcement learning and semi-supervised reinforcement learning, reward corruption stemming from systematic sensory errors may sometimes be completely managed. Second, by using randomisation to blunt the agent’s optimisation, reward corruption can be partially managed under some assumptions.},

The VRL setup allows us to remove the incentive to wirehead by placing a constraint on the agent’s actions.

This paper argues that the behavior problems can be avoided by formulating the utility function in two steps: 1) inferring a model of the environment from interactions, and 2) computing utility as a function of the environment model. The paper also argues that agents will not choose to modify their utility functions.},

The intelligent agent is patterned closely after AIXI with these speciﬁc assumptions: 1) The agent is allowed to arbitrarily modify its own inputs if it so chooses; 2) The agent’s code is a part of the environment and may be read and written by the environment. The ﬁrst of these we call the “delusion box”; the second we call “mortality”. Within this framework, we discuss and compare four very diﬀerent kinds of agents, speciﬁcally: reinforcement-learning, goal-seeking, predictive, and knowledge-seeking agents. Our main results are that: 1) The reinforcement-learning agent under reasonable circumstances behaves exactly like an agent whose sole task is to survive (to preserve the integrity of its code); and 2) Only the knowledge-seeking agent behaves completely as expected.},

	abstract = {Any agent that is part of the environment it interacts with and has versatile actuators (such as arms and ﬁngers), will in principle have the ability to self-modify – for example by changing its own source code. As we continue to create more and more intelligent agents, chances increase that they will learn about this ability. The question is: will they want to use it? For example, highly intelligent systems may ﬁnd ways to change their goals to something more easily achievable, thereby ‘escaping’ the control of their designers. In an important paper, Omohundro (2008) argued that goal preservation is a fundamental drive of any intelligent system, since a goal is more likely to be achieved if future versions of the agent strive towards the same goal. In this paper, we formalise this argument in general reinforcement learning, and explore situations where it fails. Our conclusion is that the self-modiﬁcation possibility is harmless if and only if the value function of the agent anticipates the consequences of self-modiﬁcations and use the current utility function when evaluating the future.},

In this paper, we formulate the problem of intelligent assistance in a decision-theoretic framework, and present both theoretical and empirical results. We ﬁrst introduce a class of POMDPs called hidden-goal MDPs (HGMDPs), which formalizes the problem of interactively assisting an agent whose goal is hidden and whose actions are observable. In spite of its restricted nature, we show that optimal action selection for HGMDPs is PSPACE-complete even for deterministic dynamics. We then introduce a more restricted model called helper action MDPs (HAMDPs), which are sufﬁcient for modeling many real-world problems. We show classes of HAMDPs for which efﬁcient algorithms are possible. More interestingly, for general HAMDPs we show that a simple myopic policy achieves a near optimal regret, compared to an oracle assistant that knows the agent’s goal. We then introduce more sophisticated versions of this policy for the general case of HGMDPs that we combine with a novel approach for quickly learning about the agent being assisted. We evaluate our approach in two game-like computer environments where human subjects perform tasks, and in a real-world domain of providing assistance during folder navigation in a computer desktop environment. The results show that in all three domains the framework results in an assistant that substantially reduces user effort with only modest computation.},

We outline how the AIXI model can formally solve a number of problem classes, including sequence prediction, strategic games, function minimization, reinforcement and supervised learning. The major drawback of the AIXI model is that it is uncomputable. To overcome this problem, we construct a modified algorithm AIXItl that is still effectively more intelligent than any other time t and length l bounded agent. The computation time of AIXItl is of the order t x 2{\textasciicircum}l. The discussion includes formal definitions of intelligence order relations, the horizon problem and relations of the AIXI theory to other AI approaches.},

We present a list of five practical research problems related to accident risk, categorized according to whether the problem originates from having the wrong objective function ("avoiding side effects" and "avoiding reward hacking"), an objective function that is too expensive to evaluate frequently ("scalable supervision"), or undesirable behavior during the learning process ("safe exploration" and "distributional shift"). We review previous work in these areas as well as suggesting research directions with a focus on relevance to cutting-edge AI systems. Finally, we consider the high-level question of how to think most productively about the safety of forward-looking applications of AI.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.04931},
	abstract = {A big open question of algorithmic information theory is the choice of the universal Turing machine (UTM). For Kolmogorov complexity and Solomonoff induction we have invariance theorems: the choice of the UTM changes bounds only by a constant. For the universally intelligent agent AIXI (Hutter, 2005) no invariance theorem is known. Our results are entirely negative: we discuss cases in which unlucky or adversarial choices of the UTM cause AIXI to misbehave drastically. We show that Legg-Hutter intelligence and thus balanced Pareto optimality is entirely subjective, and that every policy is Pareto optimal in the class of all computable environments. This undermines all existing optimality properties for AIXI. While it may still serve as a gold standard for AI, our results imply that AIXI is a relative theory, dependent on the choice of the UTM.},

	abstract = {This paper attempts a preliminary analysis of the general approach to AI strategy/policy research through the lens of wicked problems literature. Wicked problems are a class of social policy problems for which traditional methods of resolution fail. Super wicked problems refer to even more complex social policy problems, e.g. climate change. We first propose a hierarchy of three classes of AI strategy/policy problems, all wicked or super wicked problems. We next identify three independent super wicked problems in AI strategy/policy and propose that the most significant of these challenges – the development of safe and beneficial artificial general intelligence – to be significantly more complex and nuanced, thus posing a new degree of ‘wickedness.’ We then explore analysis and techniques for addressing wicked problems and super wicked problems. This leads to a discussion of the implications of these ideas on the problems of AI strategy/policy.},

@article{garrabrant_logical_2016,
	title = {Logical {Induction}},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03543},
	abstract = {We present a computable algorithm that assigns probabilities to every logical statement in a given formal language, and reﬁnes those probabilities over time. For instance, if the language is Peano arithmetic, it assigns probabilities to all arithmetical statements, including claims about the twin prime conjecture, the outputs of long-running computations, and its own probabilities. We show that our algorithm, an instance of what we call a logical inductor, satisﬁes a number of intuitive desiderata, including: (1) it learns to predict patterns of truth and falsehood in logical statements, often long before having the resources to evaluate the statements, so long as the patterns can be written down in polynomial time; (2) it learns to use appropriate statistical summaries to predict sequences of statements whose truth values appear pseudorandom; and (3) it learns to have accurate beliefs about its own current beliefs, in a manner that avoids the standard paradoxes of self-reference. For example, if a given computer program only ever produces outputs in a certain range, a logical inductor learns this fact in a timely manner; and if late digits in the decimal expansion of π are diﬃcult to predict, then a logical inductor learns to assign ≈ 10\% probability to “the nth digit of π is a 7” for large n. Logical inductors also learn to trust their future beliefs more than their current beliefs, and their beliefs are coherent in the limit (whenever φ → ψ, P∞(φ) ≤ P∞(ψ), and so on); and logical inductors strictly dominate the universal semimeasure in the limit. These properties and many others all follow from a single logical induction criterion, which is motivated by a series of stock trading analogies. Roughly speaking, each logical sentence φ is associated with a stock that is worth \$1 per share if φ is true and nothing otherwise, and we interpret the belief-state of a logically uncertain reasoner as a set of market prices, where Pn(φ) = 50\% means that on day n, shares of φ may be bought or sold from the reasoner for 50¢. The logical induction criterion says (very roughly) that there should not be any polynomial-time computable trading strategy with ﬁnite risk tolerance that earns unbounded proﬁts in that market over time. This criterion bears strong resemblance to the “no Dutch book” criteria that support both expected utility theory (von Neumann and Morgenstern 1944) and Bayesian probability theory (Ramsey 1931; de Finetti 1937).},

	title = {Algorithm for {Aligned} {Artiﬁcial} {General} {Intelligence}},
	abstract = {General intelligence, the ability to solve arbitrary problems, is supposed by many to be artiﬁcially constructible. Narrow intelligence, the ability to solve a particular particularly diﬃcult problem, has seen impressive recent development. Notable examples include self-driving cars, Go engines, image classiﬁers, and translators. Artiﬁcial General intelligence (AGI) presents dangers that narrow intelligence does not: if something smarter than us across every domain were indiﬀerent to our concerns, it would be an existential threat to humanity, just as we threaten many species despite no ill will. Even the theory of how to maintain the alignment of an AGI’s goals with our own has proven highly elusive. We present the ﬁrst algorithm we are aware of for aligned AGI. We thereby conﬁrm the constructibility of AGI with a construction, and identify an exception to the Instrumental Convergence Thesis, which is roughly that by default an AGI would seek power, including power over us.},

	abstract = {Rapid progress in machine learning and artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) has brought increasing attention to the potential impacts of AI technologies on society. In this paper we discuss one such potential impact: the problem of accidents in machine learning systems, deﬁned as unintended and harmful behavior that may emerge from poor design of real-world AI systems. We present a list of ﬁve practical research problems related to accident risk, categorized according to whether the problem originates from having the wrong objective function (“avoiding side eﬀects” and “avoiding reward hacking”), an objective function that is too expensive to evaluate frequently (“scalable supervision”), or undesirable behavior during the learning process (“safe exploration” and “distributional shift”). We review previous work in these areas as well as suggesting research directions with a focus on relevance to cutting-edge AI systems. Finally, we consider the high-level question of how to think most productively about the safety of forward-looking applications of AI.},

	abstract = {A value learning system has incentives to follow shutdown instructions, assuming the shutdown instruction provides information (in the technical sense) about which actions lead to valuable outcomes. However, this assumption is not robust to model mis-specification (e.g., in the case of programmer errors). We demonstrate this by presenting some Supervised POMDP scenarios in which errors in the parameterized reward function remove the incentive to follow shutdown commands. These difficulties parallel those discussed by Soares et al. (2015) in their paper on corrigibility. We argue that it is important to consider systems that follow shutdown commands under some weaker set of assumptions (e.g., that one small verified module is correctly implemented; as opposed to an entire prior probability distribution and/or parameterized reward function). We discuss some difficulties with simple ways to attempt to attain these sorts of guarantees in a value learning framework.},
