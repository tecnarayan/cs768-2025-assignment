  abstract = {This graduate-level textbook introduces fundamental concepts and methods in machine learning. It describes several important modern algorithms, provides the theoretical underpinnings of these algorithms, and illustrates key aspects for their application. The authors aim to present novel theoretical tools and concepts while giving concise proofs even for relatively advanced topics. Foundations of Machine Learning fills the need for a general textbook that also offers theoretical details and an emphasis on proofs. Certain topics that are often treated with insufficient attention are discussed in more detail here; for example, entire chapters are devoted to regression, multi-class classification, and ranking. The first three chapters lay the theoretical foundation for what follows, but each remaining chapter is mostly self-contained. The appendix offers a concise probability review, a short introduction to convex optimization, tools for concentration bounds, and several basic properties of matrices and norms used in the book. The book is intended for graduate students and researchers in machine learning, statistics, and related areas; it can be used either as a textbook or as a reference text for a research seminar. }

  URL = {http://www.jstor.org/stable/1390605},
  abstract = {The well-known EM algorithm is an optimization transfer algorithm that depends on the notion of incomplete or missing data. By invoking convexity arguments, one can construct a variety of other optimization transfer algorithms that do not involve missing data. These algorithms all rely on a majorizing or minorizing function that serves as a surrogate for the objective function. Optimizing the surrogate function drives the objective function in the correct direction. This article illustrates this general principle by a number of specific examples drawn from the statistical literature. Because optimization transfer algorithms often exhibit the slow convergence of EM algorithms, two methods of accelerating optimization transfer are discussed and evaluated in the context of specific problems.},
