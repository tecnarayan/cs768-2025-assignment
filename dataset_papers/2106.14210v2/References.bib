title = {Low-Rank Factorization of Determinantal Point Processes},
year = {2017},
publisher = {AAAI Press},
abstract = {Determinantal point processes (DPPs) have garnered attention as an elegant probabilistic model of set diversity. They are useful for a number of subset selection tasks, including product recommendation. DPPs are parametrized by a positive semi-definite kernel matrix. In this work we present a new method for learning the DPP kernel from observed data using a low-rank factorization of this kernel. We show that this low-rank factorization enables a learning algorithm that is nearly an order of magnitude faster than previous approaches, while also providing for a method for computing product recommendation predictions that is far faster (up to 20x faster or more for large item catalogs) than previous techniques that involve a full-rank DPP kernel. Furthermore, we show that our method provides equivalent or sometimes better test log-likelihood than prior full-rank DPP approaches.},

  abstract = 	 {We establish a fundamental connection between Bayesian experimental design and determinantal point processes (DPPs). Experimental design is a classical task in combinatorial optimization, where we wish to select a small subset of $d$-dimensional vectors to minimize a statistical optimality criterion. We show that a new regularized variant of DPPs can be used to design efficient algorithms for finding $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate solutions to experimental design under four commonly used optimality criteria: A-, C-, D- and V-optimality. A key novelty is that we offer improved guarantees under the Bayesian framework, where prior knowledge is incorporated into the criteria. Our algorithm returns a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate solution when the subset size $k$ is $\Omega\left(\frac{d_A}{\epsilon} + \frac{\log(11/epsilon)}{\epsilon^2}\right)$, where $d_A &lt;&lt; d$ is an effective dimension determined by prior knowledge (via a precision matrix $\mathbf{A}$).This is the first approximation guarantee where the dependence on $d$ is replaced by an effective dimension. Moreover, the time complexity of our algorithm significantly improves on existing approaches with comparable guarantees.}

@inproceedings{pmlr-v89-mariet19b,
	Abstract = {Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) have attracted significant interest from  the machine-learning community due to their ability to elegantly and tractably model the delicate balance between quality and diversity of sets.  DPPs are  commonly learned from data using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE).  While  fitting observed sets well, MLE for DPPs may also assign high likelihoods to unobserved sets that are far from the true generative distribution of the  data. To address this issue, which reduces the quality of the learned model,  we introduce a novel optimization problem, Contrastive Estimation (CE), which encodes information about "negative" samples into the basic learning  model. CE is grounded in the successful use of negative information in  machine-vision and language modeling. Depending on the chosen negative distribution (which may be static or evolve during optimization), CE assumes two different forms, which we analyze theoretically and experimentally. We  evaluate our new model on real-world datasets; on a challenging dataset, CE learning delivers a considerable improvement in predictive performance over a DPP learned without using contrastive information.},
