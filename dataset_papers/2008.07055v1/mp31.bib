abstract = {In standard matrix completion theory, it is required to have at least O(nln2 n) ob- served entries to perfectly recover a low-rank matrixM of size n Ã— n, leading to a large number of observations when n is large. In many real tasks, side informa- tion in addition to the observed entries is often available. In this work, we develop a novel theory of matrix completion that explicitly explore the side information to reduce the requirement on the number of observed entries. We show that, un- der appropriate conditions, with the assistance of side information matrices, the number of observed entries needed for a perfect recovery of matrixM can be dra- matically reduced to O(lnn). We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for matrix completion in transductive incomplete multi-label learning.},

abstract = {We revisit the inductive matrix completion problem that aims to recover a rank-{\$}r{\$} matrix with ambient dimension {\$}d{\$} given {\$}n{\$} features as the side prior information. The goal is to make use of the known {\$}n{\$} features to reduce sample and computational complexities. We present and analyze a new gradient-based non-convex optimization algorithm that converges to the true underlying matrix at a linear rate with sample complexity only linearly depending on {\$}n{\$} and logarithmically depending on {\$}d{\$}. To the best of our knowledge, all previous algorithms either have a quadratic dependency on the number of features in sample complexity or a sub-linear computational convergence rate. In addition, we provide experiments on both synthetic and real world data to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.},

@article{Chiang2018,
abstract = {Learning a low-rank matrix from missing and corrupted observations is a fundamental problem in many machine learning applications. However, the role of side information in low-rank matrix learning has received little attention, and most current approaches are either ad-hoc or only applicable in certain restrictive cases. In this paper, we propose a general model that exploits side information to better learn low-rank matrices from missing and corrupted observations, and show that the proposed model can be further applied to several popular scenarios such as matrix completion and robust PCA. Furthermore, we study the effect of side information on sample complexity and show that by using our model, the efficiency for learning can be improved given sufficiently informative side information. This result thus provides theoretical insight into the usefulness of side information in our model. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments in three real-world applications-relationship prediction, semi-supervised clustering and noisy image classification, showing that our proposed model is able to properly exploit side information for more effective learning both in theory and practice.},

abstract = {Online learning is a well established learning paradigm which has both theoretical and practical appeals. The goal of online learning is to make a sequence of accurate predictions given knowledge of the cor- rect answer to previous prediction tasks and possibly additional avail- able information. Online learning has been studied in several research fields including game theory, information theory, and machine learning. It also became of great interest to practitioners due the recent emer- gence of large scale applications such as online advertisement placement and online web ranking. In this survey we provide a modern overview of online learning. Our goal is to give the reader a sense of some of the interesting ideas and in particular to underscore the centrality of convexity in deriving efficient online learning algorithms. We do not mean to be comprehensive but rather to give a high-level, rigorous yet easy to follow, survey.},

Quantum mechanics and computer science are introduced before moving on to describe what a quantum computer is, how it can be used to solve problems faster than 'classical' computers and its real-world implementation. It concludes with an in-depth treatment of quantum information. Containing a wealth of figures and exercises, this well-known textbook is ideal for courses on the subject, and will interest beginning graduate students and researchers in physics, computer science, mathematics, and electrical engineering.},

abstract = "All natural cognitive systems, and, in particular, our own, gradually forget previously learned information. Plausible models of human cognition should therefore exhibit similar patterns of gradual forgetting of old information as new information is acquired. Only rarely does new learning in natural cognitive systems completely disrupt or erase previously learned information; that is, natural cognitive systems do not, in general, forget â€˜catastrophicallyâ€™. Unfortunately, though, catastrophic forgetting does occur under certain circumstances in distributed connectionist networks. The very features that give these networks their remarkable abilities to generalize, to function in the presence of degraded input, and so on, are found to be the root cause of catastrophic forgetting. The challenge in this field is to discover how to keep the advantages of distributed connectionist networks while avoiding the problem of catastrophic forgetting. In this article the causes, consequences and numerous solutions to the problem of catastrophic forgetting in neural networks are examined. The review will consider how the brain might have overcome this problem and will also explore the consequences of this solution for distributed connectionist networks."

	Abstract = {Multitask Learning is an approach to inductive transfer that improves generalization by using the domain information contained in the training signals of related tasks as an inductive bias. It does this by learning tasks in parallel while using a shared representation; what is learned for each task can help other tasks be learned better. This paper reviews prior work on MTL, presents new evidence that MTL in backprop nets discovers task relatedness without the need of supervisory signals, and presents new results for MTL with k-nearest neighbor and kernel regression. In this paper we demonstrate multitask learning in three domains. We explain how multitask learning works, and show that there are many opportunities for multitask learning in real domains. We present an algorithm and results for multitask learning with case-based methods like k-nearest neighbor and kernel regression, and sketch an algorithm for multitask learning in decision trees. Because multitask learning works, can be applied to many different kinds of domains, and can be used with different learning algorithms, we conjecture there will be many opportunities for its use on real-world problems.},

    Abstract = {In this paper we examine the problem of prediction with expert advice in a setup where the learner is presented with a sequence of examples coming from different tasks. In order for the learner to be able to benefit from performing multiple tasks simultaneously, we make assumptions of task
relatedness by constraining the comparator to use a lesser number of <i>best</i> experts than the number of tasks. We show how this corresponds naturally to learning under spectral or structural matrix constraints, and propose regularization techniques to enforce the constraints. The regularization techniques proposed here are interesting in their own right and multitask learning is just one application for the ideas. A theoretical analysis of one such regularizer is performed, and a regret bound that shows benefits of this setup is reported.}
