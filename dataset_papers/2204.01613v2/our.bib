Previous graph generation approaches have utilized relatively small molecular building blocks such as atoms or simple cycles, limiting their effectiveness to smaller molecules. Indeed, as we demonstrate, their performance degrades significantly for larger molecules. In this paper, we propose a new hierarchical graph encoder-decoder that employs significantly larger and more flexible graph motifs as basic building blocks. Our encoder produces a multi-resolution representation for each molecule in a fine-to-coarse fashion, from atoms to connected motifs. Each level integrates the encoding of constituents below with the graph at that level. Our autoregressive coarse-to-fine decoder adds one motif at a time, interleaving the decision of selecting a new motif with the process of resolving its attachments to the emerging molecule. We evaluate our model on multiple molecule generation tasks, including polymers, and show that our model significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines.}

abstract = {The paper studies effective approximate solutions to combinatorial counting and unform generation problems. Using a technique based on the simulation of ergodic Markov chains, it is shown that, for self-reducible structures, almost uniform generation is possible in polynomial time provided only that randomised approximate counting to within some arbitrary polynomial factor is possible in polynomial time. It follows that, for self-reducible structures, polynomial time randomised algorithms for counting to within factors of the form (1 + n√¢ÀÜ‚Äô√é¬≤) are available either for all √é¬≤ √è¬µ R or for no √é¬≤ √è¬µ R. A substantial part of the paper is devoted to investigating the rate of convergence of finite ergodic Markov chains, and a simple but powerful characterisation of rapid convergence for a broad class of chains based on a structural property of the underlying graph is established. Finally, the general techniques of the paper are used to derive an almost uniform generation procedure for labelled graphs with a given degree sequence which is valid over a much wider range of degrees than previous methods: this in turn leads to randomised approximate counting algorithms for these graphs with very good asymptotic behaviour.}

The methodology, which builds on the one developed by Tabak and Vanden-Eijnden, normalizes the data points through the composition of simple maps. The parameters of each map are determined through the maximization of a local quadratic approximation to the log-likelihood. Various candidates for the elementary maps of each step are proposed; criteria for choosing one includes robustness, computational simplicity, and good behavior in high-dimensional settings. A good choice is that of localized radial expansions, which depend on a single parameter: all the complexity of arbitrary, possibly convoluted probability densities can be built through the composition of such simple maps. ¬© 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {Deep graph generative models have recently received a surge of attention due to its superiority of modeling realistic graphs in a variety of domains, including biology, chemistry, and social science. Despite the initial success, most, if not all, of the existing works are designed for static networks. Nonetheless, many realistic networks are intrinsically dynamic and presented as a collection of system logs (i.e., timestamped interactions/edges between entities), which pose a new research direction for us: how can we synthesize realistic dynamic networks by directly learning from the system logs? In addition, how can we ensure the generated graphs preserve both the structural and temporal characteristics of the real data?To address these challenges, we propose an end-to-end deep generative framework named TagGen. In particular, we start with a novel sampling strategy for jointly extracting structural and temporal context information from temporal networks. On top of that, TagGen parameterizes a bi-level self-attention mechanism together with a family of local operations to generate temporal random walks. At last, a discriminator gradually selects generated temporal random walks, that are plausible in the input data, and feeds them to an assembling module for generating temporal networks. The experimental results in seven real-world data sets across a variety of metrics demonstrate that (1) TagGen outperforms all baselines in the temporal interaction network generation problem, and (2) TagGen significantly boosts the performance of the prediction models in the tasks of anomaly detection and link prediction.},

  abstract = 	 {Learning generative models for graph-structured data is challenging because graphs are discrete, combinatorial, and the underlying data distribution is invariant to the ordering of nodes. However, most of the existing generative models for graphs are not invariant to the chosen ordering, which might lead to an undesirable bias in the learned distribution. To address this difficulty, we propose a permutation invariant approach to modeling graphs, using the recent framework of score-based generative modeling. In particular, we design a permutation equivariant, multi-channel graph neural network to model the gradient of the data distribution at the input graph (a.k.a., the score function). This permutation equivariant model of gradients implicitly defines a permutation invariant distribution for graphs. We train this graph neural network with score matching and sample from it with annealed Langevin dynamics. In our experiments, we first demonstrate the capacity of this new architecture in learning discrete graph algorithms. For graph generation, we find that our learning approach achieves better or comparable results to existing models on benchmark datasets.}

  abstract = {The choice of approximate posterior distribution is one of the core problems in variational inference. Most applications of variational inference employ simple families of posterior approximations in order to allow for efficient inference, focusing on mean-field or other simple structured approximations. This restriction has a significant impact on the quality of inferences made using variational methods. We introduce a new approach for specifying flexible, arbitrarily complex and scalable approximate posterior distributions. Our approximations are distributions constructed through a normalizing flow, whereby a simple initial density is transformed into a more complex one by applying a sequence of invertible transformations until a desired level of complexity is attained. We use this view of normalizing flows to develop categories of finite and infinitesimal flows and provide a unified view of approaches for constructing rich posterior approximations. We demonstrate that the theoretical advantages of having posteriors that better match the true posterior, combined with the scalability of amortized variational approaches, provides a clear improvement in performance and applicability of variational inference.},

We show that, in many cases, it is possible to express such models in an auxiliary form, where continuous latent variables are conditionally deterministic given their parents and a set of independent auxiliary variables. Variables of models in this auxiliary form have much larger Markov blankets, leading to significant speedups in gradient-based inference, e.g. rapid mixing Hybrid Monte Carlo and efficient gradient-based optimization. The relative efficiency is confirmed in experiments.},

@misc{bahdanau2014neural,
  abstract = {Neural machine translation is a recently proposed approach to machine
translation. Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural
machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be
jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed
recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of
encoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into
a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this
paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in
improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and
propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for
parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word,
without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new
approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing
state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French
translation. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the
(soft-)alignments found by the model agree well with our intuition.},
