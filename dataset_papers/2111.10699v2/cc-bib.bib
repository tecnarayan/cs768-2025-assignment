In correlation clustering, one receives as input a signed graph and the goal is to partition it to minimize the number of disagreements. In this work we propose a massively parallel computation (MPC) algorithm for this problem that is considerably faster than prior work. In particular, our algorithm uses machines with memory sublinear in the number of nodes in the graph and returns a constant approximation while running only for a constant number of rounds. To the best of our knowledge, our algorithm is the first that can provably approximate a clustering problem on graphs using only a constant number of MPC rounds in the sublinear memory regime. We complement our analysis with an experimental analysis of our techniques.},

In contrast, straightforward adaptations of existing non-private algorithms all lead to a trivial quadratic error. Finally, we give a lower bound showing that any pure differentially private algorithm for correlation clustering requires additive error $\Omega$(n).}

	abstract = {Distance based clustering algorithms can group genes that show similar expression values under multiple experimental conditions. They are unable to identify a group of genes that have similar pattern of variation in their expression values. Previously we developed an algorithm called divisive correlation clustering algorithm (DCCA) to tackle this situation, which is based on the concept of correlation clustering. But this algorithm may also fail for certain cases. In order to overcome these situations, we propose a new clustering algorithm, called average correlation clustering algorithm (ACCA), which is able to produce better clustering solution than that produced by some others. ACCA is able to find groups of genes having more common transcription factors and similar pattern of variation in their expression values. Moreover, ACCA is more efficient than DCCA with respect to the time of execution. Like DCCA, we use the concept of correlation clustering concept introduced by Bansal et al. ACCA uses the correlation matrix in such a way that all genes in a cluster have the highest average correlation values with the genes in that cluster. We have applied ACCA and some well-known conventional methods including DCCA to two artificial and nine gene expression datasets, and compared the performance of the algorithms. The clustering results of ACCA are found to be more significantly relevant to the biological annotations than those of the other methods. Analysis of the results show the superiority of ACCA over some others in determining a group of genes having more common transcription factors and with similar pattern of variation in their expression profiles.

	abstract = {We introduce a new approach for finding overlapping clusters given pairwise similarities of objects. In particular, we relax the problem of correlation clustering by allowing an object to be assigned to more than one cluster. At the core of our approach is an optimization problem in which each data point is mapped to a small set of labels, representing membership in different clusters. The objective is to find a mapping so that the given similarities between objects agree as much as possible with similarities taken over their label sets. The number of labels can vary across objects. To define a similarity between label sets, we consider two measures: (i) a 0--1 function indicating whether the two label sets have non-zero intersection and (ii) the Jaccard coefficient between the two label sets. The algorithm we propose is an iterative local-search method. The definitions of label set similarity give rise to two non-trivial optimization problems, which, for the measures of set-intersection and Jaccard, we solve using a greedy strategy and non-negative least squares, respectively. We also develop a distributed version of our algorithm based on the BSP model and implement it using a Pregel framework. Our algorithm uses as input pairwise similarities of objects and can thus be applied when clustering structured objects for which feature vectors are not available. As a proof of concept, we apply our algorithms on three different and complex application domains: trajectories, amino-acid sequences, and textual documents.},

	abstract =  {Correlation clustering is an approach for clustering a set of objects from given pairwise information. In this approach, the given pairwise information is usually represented by an undirected graph with nodes corresponding to the objects, where each edge in the graph is assigned a nonnegative weight, and either the positive or negative label. Then, a clustering is obtained by solving an optimization problem of finding a partition of the node set that minimizes the disagreement or maximizes the agreement with the pairwise information. In this paper, we extend correlation clustering with disagreement minimization to deal with higher-order relationships represented by hypergraphs. We give two pivoting algorithms based on a linear programming relaxation of the problem. One achieves an                                                                           {\$}{\$}O(k {\backslash}log n){\$}{\$}                -approximation, where n is the number of nodes and k is the maximum size of hyperedges with the negative labels. This algorithm can be applied to any hyperedges with arbitrary weights. The other is an O(r)-approximation for complete r-partite hypergraphs with uniform weights. This type of hypergraphs arise from the coclustering setting of correlation clustering.},

Allowing up to k edge additions and deletions (Cluster Editing), we solve this problem in O(2.27k + |V|3) time; allowing only up to k edge deletions (Cluster Deletion), we solve this problem in O(1.77k + |V|3) time. The key ingredients of our algorithms are two easy to implement bounded search tree algorithms and an efficient polynomial-time reduction to a problem kernel of size O(k3). This improves and complements previous work. Finally, we discuss further improvements on search tree sizes using computer-generated case distinctions.},

Finding the optimal solution to the problem is proven to be NP-hard, and various algorithms have been proposed to solve the problem approximately. Unfortunately, most of them are incapable of handling large-scale data. In this paper, we relax the problem by decoupling the affinity matrix and cluster indicator matrix, and propose a pseudo-EM optimization method to improve the scalability. Experimental results on synthetic data and real world problems including image segmentation and community detection show that our technique achieves state of the art performance in terms of both accuracy and scalability.},
