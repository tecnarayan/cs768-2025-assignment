The proliferation of medical monitoring devices makes it possible to track
health vitals at high frequency, enabling the development of dynamic health
risk scores that change with the underlying readings. Survival analysis, in
particular hazard estimation, is well-suited to analyzing this stream of data
to predict disease onset as a function of the time-varying vitals. This paper
introduces the software package BoXHED (pronounced 'box-head') for
nonparametrically estimating hazard functions via gradient boosting. BoXHED 1.0
is a novel tree-based implementation of the generic estimator proposed in Lee,
Chen, Ishwaran (2017), which was designed for handling time-dependent
covariates in a fully nonparametric manner. BoXHED is also the first publicly
available software implementation for Lee, Chen, Ishwaran (2017). Applying
BoXHED to cardiovascular disease onset data from the Framingham Heart Study
reveals novel interaction effects among known risk factors, potentially
resolving an open question in clinical literature.
