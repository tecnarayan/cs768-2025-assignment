                   neural networks can exhibit a remarkably small difference
                   between training and test performance. Conventional wisdom
                   attributes small generalization error either to properties
                   of the model family, or to the regularization techniques
                   used during training. Through extensive systematic
                   experiments, we show how these traditional approaches fail
                   to explain why large neural networks generalize well in
                   practice. Specifically, our experiments establish that
                   state-of-the-art convolutional networks for image
                   classification trained with stochastic gradient methods
                   easily fit a random labeling of the training data. This
                   phenomenon is qualitatively unaffected by explicit
                   regularization, and occurs even if we replace the true
                   images by completely unstructured random noise. We
                   corroborate these experimental findings with a theoretical
                   construction showing that simple depth two neural networks
                   already have perfect finite sample expressivity as soon as
                   the number of parameters exceeds the number of data points

               of poisoning and backdoor attacks without trading off
               performance. We further verify the effectiveness of this simple
               defense against adaptive poisoning methods, and we compare to
               baselines including the popular differentially private SGD

                   Tail via Influence Estimation",
  author        = "Feldman, Vitaly and Zhang, Chiyuan",
  abstract      = "Deep learning algorithms are well-known to have a propensity
                   for fitting the training data very well and often fit even
                   outliers and mislabeled data points. Such fitting requires
                   memorization of training data labels, a phenomenon that has
                   attracted significant research interest but has not been
                   given a compelling explanation so far. A recent work of
                   Feldman (2019) proposes a theoretical explanation for this
                   phenomenon based on a combination of two insights. First,
                   natural image and data distributions are (informally) known
                   to be long-tailed, that is have a significant fraction of
                   rare and atypical examples. Second, in a simple theoretical
                   model such memorization is necessary for achieving
                   close-to-optimal generalization error when the data
                   distribution is long-tailed. However, no direct empirical
                   evidence for this explanation or even an approach for
                   obtaining such evidence were given. In this work we design
                   experiments to test the key ideas in this theory. The
                   experiments require estimation of the influence of each
                   training example on the accuracy at each test example as
                   well as memorization values of training examples. Estimating
                   these quantities directly is computationally prohibitive but
                   we show that closely-related subsampled influence and
                   memorization values can be estimated much more efficiently.
                   Our experiments demonstrate the significant benefits of
                   memorization for generalization on several standard
                   benchmarks. They also provide quantitative and visually
                   compelling evidence for the theory put forth in (Feldman,

                   state-of-the-art performance on a wide variety of
                   recognition and classification tasks. However, these
                   networks are typically computationally expensive to train,
                   requiring weeks of computation on many GPUs; as a result,
                   many users outsource the training procedure to the cloud or
                   rely on pre-trained models that are then fine-tuned for a
                   specific task. In this paper we show that outsourced
                   training introduces new security risks: an adversary can
                   create a maliciously trained network (a backdoored neural
                   network, or a \textbackslashemph\{BadNet\}) that has
                   state-of-the-art performance on the user's training and
                   validation samples, but behaves badly on specific
                   attacker-chosen inputs. We first explore the properties of
                   BadNets in a toy example, by creating a backdoored
                   handwritten digit classifier. Next, we demonstrate backdoors
                   in a more realistic scenario by creating a U.S. street sign
                   classifier that identifies stop signs as speed limits when a
                   special sticker is added to the stop sign; we then show in
                   addition that the backdoor in our US street sign detector
                   can persist even if the network is later retrained for
                   another task and cause a drop in accuracy of \{25\}\% on
                   average when the backdoor trigger is present. These results
                   demonstrate that backdoors in neural networks are both
                   powerful and---because the behavior of neural networks is
                   difficult to explicate---stealthy. This work provides

                   that are---often blatantly---mislabeled. Such samples would
                   raise suspicion upon human inspection, potentially revealing
                   the attack. Thus, for backdoor attacks to remain undetected,
                   it is crucial that they maintain label-consistency---the
                   condition that injected inputs are consistent with their
                   labels. In this work, we leverage adversarial perturbations
                   and generative models to execute efficient, yet
                   label-consistent, backdoor attacks. Our approach is based on
                   injecting inputs that appear plausible, yet are hard to
                   classify, hence causing the model to rely on the
                   (easier-to-learn) backdoor trigger.",

              performance on a wide variety of recognition and classification
              tasks. However, these networks are typically computationally
              expensive to train, requiring weeks of computation on many GPUs;
              as a result, many users outsource the training procedure to the
              cloud or rely on pre-trained models that are then fine-tuned for
              a specific task. In this paper, we show that the outsourced
              training introduces new security risks: an adversary can create a
              maliciously trained network (a backdoored neural network, or a
              BadNet) that has the state-of-the-art performance on the user's
              training and validation samples but behaves badly on specific
              attacker-chosen inputs. We first explore the properties of
              BadNets in a toy example, by creating a backdoored handwritten
              digit classifier. Next, we demonstrate backdoors in a more
              realistic scenario by creating a U.S. street sign classifier that
              identifies stop signs as speed limits when a special sticker is
              added to the stop sign; we then show in addition that the
              backdoor in our U.S. street sign detector can persist even if the
              network is later retrained for another task and cause a drop in
              an accuracy of 25\% on average when the backdoor trigger is
              present. These results demonstrate that backdoors in neural
              networks are both powerful and-because the behavior of neural
              networks is difficult to explicate-stealthy. This paper provides
              motivation for further research into techniques for verifying and

                   world can be corrupted by data poisoning attacks that inject
                   malicious points into the models' training sets. A common
                   defense against these attacks is data sanitization: first
                   filter out anomalous training points before training the
                   model. Can data poisoning attacks break data sanitization
                   defenses? In this paper, we develop three new attacks that
                   can all bypass a broad range of data sanitization defenses,
                   including commonly-used anomaly detectors based on nearest
                   neighbors, training loss, and singular-value decomposition.
                   For example, our attacks successfully increase the test
                   error on the Enron spam detection dataset from 3\% to 24\%
                   and on the IMDB sentiment classification dataset from 12\%
                   to 29\% by adding just 3\% poisoned data. In contrast, many
                   existing attacks from the literature do not explicitly
                   consider defenses, and we show that those attacks are
                   ineffective in the presence of the defenses we consider. Our
                   attacks are based on two ideas: (i) we coordinate our
                   attacks to place poisoned points near one another, which
                   fools some anomaly detectors, and (ii) we formulate each
                   attack as a constrained optimization problem, with
                   constraints designed to ensure that the poisoned points
                   evade detection. While this optimization involves solving an
                   expensive bilevel problem, we explore and develop three
                   efficient approximations to this problem based on influence
                   functions; minimax duality; and the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)

                   safety risk for machine learning (ML) systems. Traditional
                   data poisoning attacks manipulate training data to induce
                   unreliability of an ML model, whereas backdoor data
                   poisoning attacks maintain system performance unless the ML
                   model is presented with an input containing an embedded
                   ``trigger'' that provides a predetermined response
                   advantageous to the adversary. Our work builds upon prior
                   backdoor data-poisoning research for ML image classifiers
                   and systematically assesses different experimental
                   conditions including types of trigger patterns, persistence
                   of trigger patterns during retraining, poisoning strategies,
                   architectures (ResNet-50, NasNet, NasNet-Mobile), datasets

                   key findings. First, the success rate of backdoor poisoning
                   attacks varies widely, depending on several factors,
                   including model architecture, trigger pattern and
                   regularization technique. Second, we find that poisoned
                   models are hard to detect through performance inspection
                   alone. Third, regularization typically reduces backdoor
                   success rate, although it can have no effect or even
                   slightly increase it, depending on the form of
                   regularization. Finally, backdoors inserted through data
                   poisoning can be rendered ineffective after just a few
                   epochs of additional training on a small set of clean data
                   without affecting the model's performance.",

                   indistinguishable from natural data and yet classified
                   incorrectly by the network. In fact, some of the latest
                   findings suggest that the existence of adversarial attacks
                   may be an inherent weakness of deep learning models. To
                   address this problem, we study the adversarial robustness of
                   neural networks through the lens of robust optimization.
                   This approach provides us with a broad and unifying view on
                   much of the prior work on this topic. Its principled nature
                   also enables us to identify methods for both training and
                   attacking neural networks that are reliable and, in a
                   certain sense, universal. In particular, they specify a
                   concrete security guarantee that would protect against any
                   adversary. These methods let us train networks with
                   significantly improved resistance to a wide range of
                   adversarial attacks. They also suggest the notion of
                   security against a first-order adversary as a natural and

              studying adversarial attacks to secure deep models in real world
              applications has become an important research topic. Backdoor
              attacks are a form of adversarial attacks on deep networks where
              the attacker provides poisoned data to the victim to train the
              model with, and then activates the attack by showing a specific
              small trigger pattern at the test time. Most state-of-the-art
              backdoor attacks either provide mislabeled poisoning data that is
              possible to identify by visual inspection, reveal the trigger in
              the poisoned data, or use noise to hide the trigger. We propose a
              novel form of backdoor attack where poisoned data look natural
              with correct labels and also more importantly, the attacker hides
              the trigger in the poisoned data and keeps the trigger secret
              until the test time. We perform an extensive study on various
              image classification settings and show that our attack can fool
              the model by pasting the trigger at random locations on unseen
              images although the model performs well on clean data. We also

               three settings: (a) deep image classifiers with errors only in
               labels, (b) generative adversarial networks with bad training
               images, and (c) deep image classifiers with adversarial (image,
               label) pairs (i.e., backdoor attacks). For the well-studied
               setting of random label noise, our algorithm achieves
               state-of-the-art performance without having access to any
               a-priori guaranteed clean samples.",

                   wherein the attacker adds examples to the training set to
                   manipulate the behavior of the model at test time. This
                   paper explores poisoning attacks on neural nets. The
                   proposed attacks use ``clean-labels''; they don't require
                   the attacker to have any control over the labeling of
                   training data. They are also targeted; they control the
                   behavior of the classifier on a $\textit\{specific\}$ test
                   instance without degrading overall classifier performance.
                   For example, an attacker could add a seemingly innocuous
                   image (that is properly labeled) to a training set for a
                   face recognition engine, and control the identity of a
                   chosen person at test time. Because the attacker does not
                   need to control the labeling function, poisons could be
                   entered into the training set simply by leaving them on the
                   web and waiting for them to be scraped by a data collection
                   bot. We present an optimization-based method for crafting
                   poisons, and show that just one single poison image can
                   control classifier behavior when transfer learning is used.
                   For full end-to-end training, we present a ``watermarking''
                   strategy that makes poisoning reliable using multiple
                   ($\approx$50) poisoned training instances. We demonstrate
                   our method by generating poisoned frog images from the CIFAR
                   dataset and using them to manipulate image classifiers.",

  abstract  = "Machine learning is one of the fastest growing areas of computer
               science, with far-reaching applications. The aim of this
               textbook is to introduce machine learning, and the algorithmic
               paradigms it offers, in a principled way. The book provides a
               theoretical account of the fundamentals underlying machine
               learning and the mathematical derivations that transform these
               principles into practical algorithms. Following a presentation
               of the basics, the book covers a wide array of central topics
               unaddressed by previous textbooks. These include a discussion of
               the computational complexity of learning and the concepts of
               convexity and stability; important algorithmic paradigms
               including stochastic gradient descent, neural networks, and
               structured output learning; and emerging theoretical concepts
               such as the PAC-Bayes approach and compression-based bounds.
               Designed for advanced undergraduates or beginning graduates, the
               text makes the fundamentals and algorithms of machine learning
               accessible to students and non-expert readers in statistics,

                   collection of $m$ points in $\mathbb\{R\}^n$, if many but
                   not necessarily all of these points are contained in a
                   $d$-dimensional subspace $T$ can we find it? The points
                   contained in $T$ are called \{\textbackslashem inliers\} and
                   the remaining points are \{\textbackslashem outliers\}. This
                   problem has received considerable attention in computer
                   science and in statistics. Yet efficient algorithms from
                   computer science are not robust to \{\textbackslashem
                   adversarial\} outliers, and the estimators from robust
                   statistics are hard to compute in high dimensions. Are there
                   algorithms for subspace recovery that are both robust to
                   outliers and efficient? We give an algorithm that finds $T$
                   when it contains more than a $\frac\{d\}\{n\}$ fraction of
                   the points. Hence, for say $d = n/2$ this estimator is both
                   easy to compute and well-behaved when there are a constant
                   fraction of outliers. We prove that it is Small Set
                   Expansion hard to find $T$ when the fraction of errors is
                   any larger, thus giving evidence that our estimator is an
                   \{\textbackslashem optimal\} compromise between efficiency
                   and robustness. As it turns out, this basic problem has a

                   small set expansion, matroid theory and functional analysis
