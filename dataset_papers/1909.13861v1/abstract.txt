How should a player who repeatedly plays a game against a no-regret learner
strategize to maximize his utility? We study this question and show that under
some mild assumptions, the player can always guarantee himself a utility of at
least what he would get in a Stackelberg equilibrium of the game. When the
no-regret learner has only two actions, we show that the player cannot get any
higher utility than the Stackelberg equilibrium utility. But when the no-regret
learner has more than two actions and plays a mean-based no-regret strategy, we
show that the player can get strictly higher than the Stackelberg equilibrium
utility. We provide a characterization of the optimal game-play for the player
against a mean-based no-regret learner as a solution to a control problem. When
the no-regret learner's strategy also guarantees him a no-swap regret, we show
that the player cannot get anything higher than a Stackelberg equilibrium
utility.
