  abstract  = {This paper shows that a macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) relating average flow and average density must exist on any street with blocks of diverse widths and lengths, but no turns, even if all or some of the intersections are controlled by arbitrarily timed traffic signals. The timing patterns are assumed to be fixed in time. Exact analytical expressions in terms of a shortest path recipe are given, both, for the street’s capacity and its MFD. Approximate formulas that require little data are also given.

For networks, the paper derives an upper bound for average flow conditional on average density, and then suggests conditions under which the bound should be tight; i.e., under which the bound is an approximate MFD. The MFD’s produced with this method for the central business districts of San Francisco (California) and Yokohama (Japan) are compared with those obtained experimentally in earlier publications.},

  abstract  = {The development of dedicated numerical codes has recently pushed forward the study of N-body gravitational dynamics, leading to a better and wider understanding of processes involving the formation of natural bodies in the Solar System. A major branch includes the study of asteroid formation: evidence from recent studies and observations support the idea that small and medium size asteroids between 100 m and 100 km may be gravitational aggregates with no cohesive force other than gravity. This evidence implies that asteroid formation depends on gravitational interactions between different boulders and that asteroid aggregation processes can be naturally modeled with N-body numerical codes implementing gravitational interactions. This work presents a new implementation of an N-body numerical solver. The code is based on Chrono::Engine (2006). It handles the contact and collision of large numbers of complex-shaped objects, while simultaneously evaluating the effect of N to N gravitational interactions. A special case of study is considered, investigating the relative dynamics between the N bodies and highlighting favorable conditions for the formation of a stable gravitationally bound aggregate from a cloud of N boulders. The code is successfully validated for the case of study by comparing relevant results obtained for typical known dynamical scenarios. The outcome of the numerical simulations shows good agreement with theory and observation, and suggests the ability of the developed code to predict natural aggregation phenomena.},

  abstract  = {We examine the shape of a “rubble pile” asteroid as it slowly gains angular momentum by YORP torque, to the point where “landsliding” occurs. We find that it evolves to a “top” shape with constant angle of repose from the equator up to mid-latitude, closely resembling the shapes of several nearly critically spinning asteroids imaged by radar, most notably (66391) 1999 KW4 [Ostro, S.J., Margot, J.-L., Benner, L.A.M., Giorgini, J.D., Scheeres, D.J., Fahnestock, E.G., Broschart, S.B., Bellerose, J., Nolan, M.C., Magri, C., Pravec, P., Scheirich, P., Rose, R., Jurgens, R.F., De Jong, E.M., Suzuki, S., 2006. Science 314, 1276–1280]. Similar calculations for non-spinning extremely prolate or oblate “rubble piles” show that even loose rubble can sustain shapes far from fluid equilibrium, thus inferences based on fluid equilibrium are generally useless for inferring bulk properties such as density of small bodies. We also investigate the tidal effects of a binary system with a “top shape” primary spinning at near the critical limit for stability. We find that very close to the stability limit, the tide from the secondary can actually levitate loose debris from the surface and re-deposit it, in a process we call “tidal saltation.” In the process, angular momentum is transferred from the primary spin to the satellite orbit, thus maintaining the equilibrium of near-critical spin as YORP continues to add angular momentum to the system. We note that this process is in fact dynamically related to the process of “shepherding” of narrow rings by neighboring satellites.},
