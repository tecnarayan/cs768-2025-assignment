Privacy \&amp;amp; Confidentiality 2017) does not satisfy our requirements, as it is based on real arithmetic, and natural discrete analogues, such as the Geometric Mechanism (Ghosh, Roughgarden, Sundarajan, STOC 2009 and SICOMP 2012), take time at least linear in |X|, which can be exponential in the bit length of the input.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot;-qt-paragraph-type: empty; -qt-block-indent: 0; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot;-qt-block-indent: 0; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;&quot;&gt;In this paper, we provide strict polynomial-time discrete algorithms for approximate histograms whose simultaneous accuracy (the maximum error over all bins) matches that of the Laplace Mechanism up to constant factors, while retaining the same (pure) differential privacy guarantee.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot;-qt-block-indent: 0; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;&quot;&gt;One of our algorithms produces a sparse histogram as output.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot;-qt-block-indent: 0; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;&quot;&gt;Its ``&quot;per-bin accuracy&quot; (the error on individual bins) is worse than that of the Laplace Mechanism by a factor of log|X|, but we prove a lower bound showing that this is necessary for any algorithm that produces a sparse histogram.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot;-qt-block-indent: 0; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;&quot;&gt;A second algorithm avoids this lower bound, and matches the per-bin accuracy of the Laplace Mechanism, by producing a compact and efficiently computable representation of a dense histogram; it is based on an (n+1)-wise independent implementation of an appropriately clamped version of the Discrete Geometric Mechanism.&lt;/p&#38;gt;}, number={2}, journal={Journal of Privacy and Confidentiality}, author={Balcer, Victor and Vadhan, Salil}, year={2019}, month={Sep.} }

We derive new lower bounds using the duality of linear programming, and new upper bounds by analyzing a special class of (epsilon, delta)-differentially private mechanisms, the truncated Laplacian mechanisms. We show that the multiplicative gap of the lower bounds and upper bounds goes to zero in various high privacy regimes, proving the tightness of the lower and upper bounds. In particular, our results close the previous constant multiplicative gap in the discrete setting. Numeric experiments show the improvement of the truncated Laplacian mechanism over the optimal Gaussian mechanism in all privacy regimes.}
