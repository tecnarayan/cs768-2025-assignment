We introduce the Graph Mixture Density Networks, a new family of machine
learning models that can fit multimodal output distributions conditioned on
graphs of arbitrary topology. By combining ideas from mixture models and graph
representation learning, we address a broader class of challenging conditional
density estimation problems that rely on structured data. In this respect, we
evaluate our method on a new benchmark application that leverages random graphs
for stochastic epidemic simulations. We show a significant improvement in the
likelihood of epidemic outcomes when taking into account both multimodality and
structure. The empirical analysis is complemented by two real-world regression
tasks showing the effectiveness of our approach in modeling the output
prediction uncertainty. Graph Mixture Density Networks open appealing research
opportunities in the study of structure-dependent phenomena that exhibit
non-trivial conditional output distributions.
