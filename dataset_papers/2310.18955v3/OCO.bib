  abstract = 	 {The equivalence of realizable and agnostic learnability is a fundamental phenomenon in learning theory. With variants ranging from classical settings like PAC learning and regression to recent trends such as adversarially robust and private learning, itâ€™s surprising we still lack a unified theory; traditional proofs of the equivalence tend to be disparate, and rely on strong model-specific assumptions like uniform convergence and sample compression.  In this work, we give the first model-independent framework explaining the equivalence of realizable and agnostic learnability: a three-line blackbox reduction that simplifies, unifies, and extends our understanding across a wide variety of settings. This includes models with no known characterization of learnability such as learning with arbitrary distributional assumptions or general loss, as well as a host of other popular settings such as robust learning, partial learning, fair learning, and the statistical query model. More generally, we argue that the equivalence of realizable and agnostic learning is actually a special case of a broader phenomenon we call property generalization: any desirable property of a learning algorithm (e.g. noise tolerance, privacy, stability) that can be satisfied over finite hypothesis classes extends (possibly in some variation) to any learnable hypothesis class.}

  abstract = 	 {We study a class of online convex optimization problems with long-term budget constraints that arise naturally as reliability guarantees or total consumption constraints. In this general setting, prior work by Mannor et al. (2009) has shown that achieving no regret is impossible if the functions defining the agentâ€™s budget are chosen by an adversary. To overcome this obstacle, we refine the agentâ€™s regret metric by introducing the notion of a "K-benchmark", i.e., a comparator which meets the problemâ€™s allotted budget over any window of length K. The impossibility analysis of Mannor et al. (2009) is recovered when K=T; however, for K=o(T), we show that it is possible to minimize regret while still meeting the problemâ€™s long-term budget constraints. We achieve this via an online learning policy based on Cautious Online Lagrangiant Descent (COLD) for which we derive explicit bounds, in terms of both the incurred regret and the residual budget violations.}

  abstract = 	 {In this work we study the safe sequential decision making problem under the setting of adversarial contextual bandits with sequential risk constraints. At each round, nature prepares a context, a cost for each arm, and additionally a risk for each arm. The learner leverages the context to pull an arm and receives the corresponding cost and risk associated with the pulled arm. In addition to minimizing the cumulative cost, for safety purposes, the learner needs to make safe decisions such that the average of the cumulative risk from all pulled arms should not be larger than a pre-defined threshold. To address this problem, we first study online convex programming in the full information setting where in each round the learner receives an adversarial convex loss and a convex constraint. We develop a meta algorithm leveraging online mirror descent for the full information setting and then extend it to contextual bandit with sequential risk constraints setting using expert advice. Our algorithms can achieve near-optimal regret in terms of minimizing the total cost, while successfully maintaining a sub-linear growth of accumulative risk constraint violation. We support our theoretical results by demonstrating our algorithm on a simple simulated robotics reactive control task.}

abstract = {Thompson sampling is one of the earliest randomized algorithms for multi-armed bandits (MAB). In this paper, we extend the Thompson sampling to Budgeted MAB, where there is random cost for pulling an arm and the total cost is constrained by a budget. We start with the case of Bernoulli bandits, in which the random rewards (costs) of an arm are independently sampled from a Bernoulli distribution. To implement the Thompson sampling algorithm in this case, at each round, we sample two numbers from the posterior distributions of the reward and cost for each arm, obtain their ratio, select the arm with the maximum ratio, and then update the posterior distributions. We prove that the distribution-dependent regret bound of this algorithm is O(lnB), where B denotes the budget. By introducing a Bernoulli trial, we further extend this algorithm to the setting that the rewards (costs) are drawn from general distributions, and prove that its regret bound remains almost the same. Our simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

abstract = {This paper addresses a generic sequential resource allocation problem, where in each round a decision maker selects an allocation of resources (servers) to a set of tasks consisting of a large number of jobs. A job of task i assigned to server j is successfully treated with probability Î¸_ij $ in a round, and the decision maker is informed on whether this job is completed at the end of the round. The probabilities Î¸_ij $'s are initially unknown and have to be learned. The objective of the decision maker is to sequentially assign jobs of various tasks to servers so that it rapidly learns and converges to the Proportionally Fair (PF) allocation (or other similar allocations achieving an appropriate trade-off between efficiency and fairness). We formulate the problem as a multi-armed bandit (MAB) optimization problem, and devise sequential assignment algorithms with low regret (defined as the difference in utility achieved by an oracle algorithm aware of the Î¸_ij $'s and by the proposed algorithm over a given number of slots). We first provide the properties of the so-called Restricted-PF (RPF) allocation, obtained by assuming that each task can only use a single server, and in particular show that it is very close to the PF allocation. We devise ES-RPF, an algorithm that learns the RPF allocation with regret no greater than $mathcal O bigl(m^3\o{}ver Î¸_min Î”_min \l{}og(T)big)$ after T slots, where m , Î¸_min $, and Î”_min $ represent the number of tasks, the minimum success rate $min_i,j Î¸_ij $, and an appropriately defined notion of gap, respectively. We further provide regret lower bounds satisfied by any algorithm targeting the RPF allocation. Finally, we present ES-PF, an algorithm directly learning the PF allocation, and prove that its regret does not exceed $mathcal O bigl(fracm^2s Î¸_min sqrtT \l{}og(T)big)$ after T slots, where s denotes the number of servers.},

The main conceptual contribution of this paper is a framework for fair classification comprising (1) a (hypothetical) task-specific metric for determining the degree to which individuals are similar with respect to the classification task at hand; (2) an algorithm for maximizing utility subject to the fairness constraint, that similar individuals are treated similarly. We also present an adaptation of our approach to achieve the complementary goal of "fair affirmative action," which guarantees statistical parity (i.e., the demographics of the set of individuals receiving any classification are the same as the demographics of the underlying population), while treating similar individuals as similarly as possible. Finally, we discuss the relationship of fairness to privacy: when fairness implies privacy, and how tools developed in the context of differential privacy may be applied to fairness.},

abstract = {We consider jamming in wireless networks in the framework of zero-sum games with Î±-fairness utility functions. The base station has to distribute the power fairly among the users in the presence of a jammer. The jammer in turn tries to distribute its power among the channels to produce as much harm as possible. The Shannon capacity and the SNIR optimization are particular cases of the proposed more general Î±-fairness SNIR based utility functions. Specifically, we consider two Î±-fairness utility functions, based on SNIR and Shifted SNIR. This game can also be viewed as a minimax problem against the nature. We show that the game has the unique equilibrium and investigate its properties. In particular, in several important cases we present the equilibrium strategies and Jainâ€™s fairness index in closed form. It turns out that there is an important difference between SNIR and Shifted SNIR Î±-fairness utility functions. In the case of the SNIR based utility function all users obtain non-zero powers when Î±>0. On the contrary, when the Shifted SNIR based utility function is used, some users with bad channel conditions might not receive any power at all.}

We investigate the interplay between learning and fairness in terms of a pre-specified vector denoting the fractions of guaranteed pulls. We define a fairness-aware regret, which we call r-Regret, that takes into account the above fairness constraints and extends the conventional notion of regret in a natural way. Our primary contribution is to obtain a complete characterization of a class of Fair-MAB algorithms via two parameters: the unfairness tolerance and the learning algorithm used as a black-box. For this class of algorithms, we provide a fairness guarantee that holds uniformly over time, irrespective of the chosen learning algorithm. Further, when the learning algorithm is UCB1, we show that our algorithm achieves constant r-Regret for a large enough time horizon. Finally, we analyze the cost of fairness in terms of the conventional notion of regret. We conclude by experimentally validating our theoretical results.},

abstract = {The classic utility maximization framework studies the fairness-efficiency tradeoff in various resource allocation problems (e.g., bandwidth allocation). The weighted alpha-fair utility is a common utilitarian metric. However, this classic framework cannot tackle those allocation problems with the online decision-making requirement (e.g., caching capacity allocation under unknown requests). Existing studies on these online allocation problems largely follow the online learning approaches, thus inevitably overlook the allocation fairness. In this paper, we propose a novel utility maximization framework accommodating the online setting. The major challenge of designing this framework lies in the tight coupling between the desirable fairness guarantee and the unknown allocation efficiency. To tackle this, we integrate the weighted alpha-fair utility with the learning rationale, by properly devising the merit-based weights and the increasing fairness levels. Under our proposed framework, the utility-maximizing allocation in each time slot is weighted alpha-fair. Our framework also performs asymptotically as well as the offline optimal/efficient outcome. We demonstrate how this framework functions in two networking applications. In size-based scheduling, it enables network switches to prioritize short flows and avoid flow starvation without the prior flow size information. In file caching, our framework outperforms several state-of-the-art caching policies up to 21\% in terms of cache-hit-ratio.},
