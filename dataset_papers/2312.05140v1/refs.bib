	abstract = {Bayesian optimization is a powerful tool for fine-tuning the hyper-parameters of a wide variety of machine learning models. The success of machine learning has led practitioners in diverse real-world settings to learn classifiers for practical problems. As machine learning becomes commonplace, Bayesian optimization becomes an attractive method for practitioners to automate the process of classifier hyper-parameter tuning. A key observation is that the data used for tuning models in these settings is often sensitive. Certain data such as genetic prearaosition, personal email statistics, and car accident history, if not properly private, may be at risk of being inferred from Bayesian optimization outputs. To address this, we introduce methods for releasing the best hyper-parameters and classifier accuracy privately. Leveraging the strong theoretical guarantees of differential privacy and known Bayesian optimization convergence bounds, we prove that under a GP assumption these private quantities are often near-optimal. Finally, even if this assumption is not satisfied, we can use different smoothness guarantees to protect privacy.},

@inproceedings{BO,
	abstract = {The use of machine learning algorithms frequently involves careful tuning of learning parameters and model hyperparameters. Unfortunately, this tuning is often a "black art" requiring expert experience, rules of thumb, or sometimes brute-force search. There is therefore great appeal for automatic approaches that can optimize the performance of any given learning algorithm to the problem at hand. In this work, we consider this problem through the framework of Bayesian optimization, in which a learning algorithm's generalization performance is modeled as a sample from a Gaussian process (GP). We show that certain choices for the nature of the GP, such as the type of kernel and the treatment of its hyperparameters, can play a crucial role in obtaining a good optimizer that can achieve expertlevel performance. We describe new algorithms that take into account the variable cost (duration) of learning algorithm experiments and that can leverage the presence of multiple cores for parallel experimentation. We show that these proposed algorithms improve on previous automatic procedures and can reach or surpass human expert-level optimization for many algorithms including latent Dirichlet allocation, structured SVMs and convolutional neural networks.},

Ideally, although generally not done, the agency also provides a way for secondary data analysts to assess the quality of inferences obtained with the released data. Quality measures can help secondary data analysts to identify inaccurate conclusions resulting from the disclosure limitation procedures, as well as have confidence in accurate conclusions. We propose a framework for an interactive, web-based system that analysts can query for measures of inferential quality. As we illustrate, agencies seeking to build such systems must consider the additional disclosure risks from releasing quality measures. We suggest some avenues of research on limiting these risks.}

abstract = {Differential privacy is a robust privacy standard that has been successfully applied
to a range of data analysis tasks. We describe the matrix mechanism, an algorithm
for answering a workload of linear counting queries that adapts the noise distribution
to properties of the provided queries. Given a workload, the mechanism uses a different
set of queries, called a query strategy, which are answered using a standard Laplace
or Gaussian mechanism. Noisy answers to the workload queries are then derived from
the noisy answers to the strategy queries. This two-stage process can result in a
more complex, correlated noise distribution that preserves differential privacy but
increases accuracy. We provide a formal analysis of the error of query answers produced
by the mechanism and investigate the problem of computing the optimal query strategy
in support of a given workload. We show that this problem can be formulated as a rank-constrained
semidefinite program. We analyze two seemingly distinct techniques proposed in the
literature, whose similar behavior is explained by viewing them as instances of the
matrix mechanism. We also describe an extension of the mechanism in which nonnegativity
constraints are included in the derivation process and provide experimental evidence
of its efficacy.},

of query workloads, or are extremely slow, especially when analyzing more than one
or two dimensions of the data.In this work we propose HDMM, a new differentially private
algorithm for answering a workload of predicate counting queries, that is especially
effective for higher-dimensional datasets. HDMM represents query workloads using an
implicit matrix representation and exploits this compact representation to efficiently
search (a subset of) the space of differentially private algorithms for one that answers
the input query workload with high accuracy. We empirically show that HDMM can efficiently
answer queries with lower error than state-of-the-art techniques on a variety of low

	abstract = {The decennial census is the primary source of statistical information about the US population, and the quality of its data is of great interest to numerous stakeholders. One particular concern is the accuracy of census data products in light of proposed disclosure avoidance methodologies, especially if these methods disproportionately affect scientific understandings of contemporary social phenomena. Using the 2010 decennial counts produced with proposed differential privacy and traditional techniques, we evaluate how the implementation of differential privacy can affect understandings of mortality rates by obscuring accurate denominators. We find that the implementation of differential privacy will produce dramatic changes in population counts for racial/ethnic minorities in small areas and less urban settings, significantly altering knowledge about health disparities in mortality.The application of a currently proposed differential privacy algorithm to the 2020 United States Census data and additional data products may affect the usefulness of these data, the accuracy of estimates and rates derived from them, and critical knowledge about social phenomena such as health disparities. We test the ramifications of applying differential privacy to released data by studying estimates of US mortality rates for the overall population and three major racial/ethnic groups. We ask how changes in the denominators of these vital rates due to the implementation of differential privacy can lead to biased estimates. We situate where these changes are most likely to matter by disaggregating biases by population size, degree of urbanization, and adjacency to a metropolitan area. Our results suggest that differential privacy will more strongly affect mortality rate estimates for non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics than estimates for non-Hispanic whites. We also find significant changes in estimated mortality rates for less populous areas, with more pronounced changes when stratified by race/ethnicity. We find larger changes in estimated mortality rates for areas with lower levels of urbanization or adjacency to metropolitan areas, with these changes being greater for non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics. These findings highlight the consequences of implementing differential privacy, as proposed, for research examining population composition, particularly mortality disparities across racial/ethnic groups and along the urban/rural continuum. Overall, they demonstrate the challenges in using the data products derived from the proposed disclosure avoidance methods, while highlighting critical instances where scientific understandings may be negatively impacted.},

abstract = {The recent adoption of machine learning models in high-risk settings such as medicine
has increased demand for developments in privacy and fairness. Rebalancing skewed
datasets using synthetic data created by generative adversarial networks (GANs) has
shown potential to mitigate disparate impact on minoritized subgroups. However, such
generative models are subject to privacy attacks that can expose sensitive data from
the training dataset. Differential privacy (DP) is the current leading solution for
privacy-preserving machine learning. Differentially private GANs (DP GANs) are often
considered a potential solution for improving model fairness while maintaining privacy
of sensitive training data. We investigate the impact of using synthetic images from
DP GANs on downstream classification model utility and fairness. We demonstrate that
existing DP GANs cannot simultaneously maintain model utility, privacy, and fairness.
The images generated from GAN models trained with DP exhibit extreme decreases in
image quality and utility which leads to poor downstream classification model performance.
Our evaluation highlights the friction between privacy, fairness, and utility and
how this directly translates into real loss of performance and representation in common
machine learning settings. Our results show that additional work improving the utility
and fairness of DP generative models is required before they can be utilized as a
potential solution to privacy and fairness issues stemming from lack of diversity
in the training dataset.},

	abstract = {Privacy-preserving machine learning is becoming increasingly important as models are being used on sensitive data such as electronic health records. Differential privacy is considered the gold standard framework for achieving strong privacy guarantees in machine learning. Yet, the performance implications of learning with differential privacy have not been characterized in the presence of time-varying hospital policies, care practices, and known class imbalance present in health data. First, we demon- strate that due to the long-tailed nature of health- care data, learning with differential privacy results in poor utility tradeoffs. Second, we demonstrate through an application of influence functions that learning with differential privacy leads to disproportionate influence from the majority group on model predictions which results in negative consequences for utility and fairness. Our results high- light important implications of differentially private learning; which focuses by design on learn- ing the body of a distribution to protect privacy but omits important information contained in the tails of healthcare data distributions.},

The goal is the development of algorithms that can effectively identify and take action upon members of the targeted subpopulation in a way that minimally compromises the privacy of the protected, while simultaneously limiting the expense of distinguishing members of the two groups via costly mechanisms such as surveillance, background checks, or medical testing. Within this framework, we provide provably privacy-preserving algorithms for targeted search in social networks. These algorithms are natural variants of common graph search methods, and ensure privacy for the protected by the careful injection of noise in the prioritization of potential targets.

abstract="As a common concept in multi-objective optimization, minimizing a weighted sum constitutes an independent method as well as a component of other methods. Consequently, insight into characteristics of the weighted sum method has far reaching implications. However, despite the many published applications for this method and the literature addressing its pitfalls with respect to depicting the Pareto optimal set, there is little comprehensive discussion concerning the conceptual significance of the weights and techniques for maximizing the effectiveness of the method with respect to a priori articulation of preferences. Thus, in this paper, we investigate the fundamental significance of the weights in terms of preferences, the Pareto optimal set, and objective-function values. We determine the factors that dictate which solution point results from a particular set of weights. Fundamental deficiencies are identified in terms of a priori articulation of preferences, and guidelines are provided to help avoid blind use of the method.",

abstract="A survey of current continuous nonlinear multi-objective optimization (MOO) concepts and methods is presented. It consolidates and relates seemingly different terminology and methods. The methods are divided into three major categories: methods with a priori articulation of preferences, methods with a posteriori articulation of preferences, and methods with no articulation of preferences. Genetic algorithms are surveyed as well. Commentary is provided on three fronts, concerning the advantages and pitfalls of individual methods, the different classes of methods, and the field of MOO as a whole. The Characteristics of the most significant methods are summarized. Conclusions are drawn that reflect often-neglected ideas and applicability to engineering problems. It is found that no single approach is superior. Rather, the selection of a specific method depends on the type of information that is provided in the problem, the user's preferences, the solution requirements, and the availability of software. ",

We show that it is possible to cut N in (k - 1) · t places and partition the resulting intervals into k collections, each containing precisely ai beads of color i, 1 ⩽ i ⩽ t. This result is best possible and solves a problem of Goldberg and West. Its proof is topological and uses a generalization, due to Bárány, Shlosman and Szücs, of the Borsuk-Ulam theorem. By similar methods we obtain a generalization of a theorem of Hobby and Rice on L1-approximation.}

monetary transfers. Despite the vast literature on this very standard model, it still
remains unclear how do truthful mechanisms look like. We focus on the case of two
players with additive valuation functions and our purpose is twofold. First, our main
result provides a complete characterization of truthful mechanisms that allocate all
the items to the players. Our characterization reveals an interesting structure underlying
all truthful mechanisms, showing that they can be decomposed into two components:
a selection part where players pick their best subset among prespecified choices determined
by the mechanism, and an exchange part where players are offered the chance to exchange
certain subsets if it is favorable to do so. In the remaining paper, we apply our
main result and derive several consequences on the design of mechanisms with fairness
guarantees. We consider various notions of fairness, (indicatively, maximin share
guarantees and envy-freeness up to one item) and provide tight bounds for their approximability.
Our work settles some of the open problems in this agenda, and we conclude by discussing
possible extensions to more players.},

abstract = {We study the problem of allocating a set of indivisible goods among a set of agents
in a fair and efficient manner. An allocation is said to be fair if it is envy-free
up to one good (EF1), which means that each agent prefers its own bundle over the
bundle of any other agent up to the removal of one good. In addition, an allocation
is deemed efficient if it satisfies Pareto efficiency. While each of these well-studied
properties is easy to achieve separately, achieving them together is far from obvious.
Recently, Caragiannis et al. (2016) established the surprising result that when agents
have additive valuations for the goods, there always exists an allocation that simultaneously
satisfies these two seemingly incompatible properties. Specifically, they showed that
an allocation that maximizes the Nash social welfare objective is both EF1 and Pareto
efficient. However, the problem of maximizing Nash social welfare is NP-hard. As a
result, this approach does not provide an efficient algorithm for finding a fair and
efficient allocation. In this paper, we bypass this barrier, and develop a pseudopolynomial
time algorithm for finding allocations that are EF1 and Pareto efficient; in particular,
when the valuations are bounded, our algorithm finds such an allocation in polynomial
time. Furthermore, we establish a stronger existence result compared to Caragiannis
et al. (2016): For additive valuations, there always exists an allocation that is
EF1 and fractionally Pareto efficient. Another key contribution of our work is to
show that our algorithm provides a polynomial-time 1.45-approximation to the Nash
social welfare objective. This improves upon the best known approximation ratio for
this problem (namely, the 2-approximation algorithm of Cole et al., 2017), and also
matches the lower bound on the integrality gap of the convex program of Cole et al.
(2017). Unlike many of the existing approaches, our algorithm is completely combinatorial,
and relies on constructing integral Fisher markets wherein specific equilibria are
not only efficient, but also fair.},

abstract = {This paper describes a testing methodology for quantitatively assessing the risk that
rare or unique training-data sequences are unintentionally memorized by generative
sequence models--a common type of machine-learning model. Because such models are
sometimes trained on sensitive data (e.g., the text of users' private messages), this
methodology can benefit privacy by allowing deep-learning practitioners to select
means of training that minimize such memorization.In experiments, we show that unintended
memorization is a persistent, hard-to-avoid issue that can have serious consequences.
Specifically, for models trained without consideration of memorization, we describe
new, efficient procedures that can extract unique, secret sequences, such as credit
card numbers. We show that our testing strategy is a practical and easy-to-use first
line of defense, e.g., by describing its application to quantitatively limit data
exposure in Google's Smart Compose, a commercial text-completion neural network trained
on millions of users' email messages.},

We investigate whether this equivalence extends to multi-class classification and regression. First, we show that private learnability implies online learnability in both settings. Our extension involves studying a novel variant of the Littlestone dimension that depends on a tolerance parameter and on an appropriate generalization of the concept of threshold functions beyond binary classification. Second, we show that while online learnability continues to imply private learnability in multi-class classification, current proof techniques encounter significant hurdles in the regression setting. While the equivalence for regression remains open, we provide non-trivial sufficient conditions for an online learnable class to also be privately learnable.},

An interactive differentially private mechanism is an algorithm that allows an analyst to adaptively ask queries about a sensitive dataset, with the property that an adversarial analyst's view of the interaction is approximately the same regardless of whether or not any individual's data is in the dataset. Previous studies of composition of differential privacy have focused on non-interactive algorithms, but interactive mechanisms are needed to capture many of the intended applications of differential privacy and a number of the important differentially private primitives.",

abstract = {This paper studies the synthesis of high-dimensional datasets with differential privacy (DP). The state-of-the-art solution addresses this problem by first generating a set M of noisy low-dimensional marginals of the input data D, and then use them to approximate the data distribution in D for synthetic data generation. However, it imposes several constraints on M that considerably limits the choices of marginals. This makes it difficult to capture all important correlations among attributes, which in turn degrades the quality of the resulting synthetic data.To address the above deficiency, we propose PrivMRF, a method that (i) also utilizes a set M of low-dimensional marginals for synthesizing high-dimensional data with DP, but (ii) provides a high degree of flexibility in the choices of marginals. The key idea of PrivMRF is to select an appropriate M to construct a Markov random field (MRF) that models the correlations among the attributes in the input data, and then use the MRF for data synthesis. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets show that PrivMRF consistently outperforms the state of the art in terms of the accuracy of counting queries and classification tasks conducted on the synthetic data generated.},

abstract = {Privacy-preserving data publishing is an important problem that has been the focus of extensive study. The state-of-the-art solution for this problem is differential privacy, which offers a strong degree of privacy protection without making restrictive assumptions about the adversary. Existing techniques using differential privacy, however, cannot effectively handle the publication of high-dimensional data. In particular, when the input dataset contains a large number of attributes, existing methods require injecting a prohibitive amount of noise compared to the signal in the data, which renders the published data next to useless.To address the deficiency of the existing methods, this paper presents PrivBayes, a differentially private method for releasing high-dimensional data. Given a dataset D, PrivBayes first constructs a Bayesian network N, which (i) provides a succinct model of the correlations among the attributes in D and (ii) allows us to approximate the distribution of data in D using a set P of low-dimensional marginals of D. After that, PrivBayes injects noise into each marginal in P to ensure differential privacy and then uses the noisy marginals and the Bayesian network to construct an approximation of the data distribution in D. Finally, PrivBayes samples tuples from the approximate distribution to construct a synthetic dataset, and then releases the synthetic data. Intuitively, PrivBayes circumvents the curse of dimensionality, as it injects noise into the low-dimensional marginals in P instead of the high-dimensional dataset D. Private construction of Bayesian networks turns out to be significantly challenging, and we introduce a novel approach that uses a surrogate function for mutual information to build the model more accurately. We experimentally evaluate PrivBayes on real data and demonstrate that it significantly outperforms existing solutions in terms of accuracy.},

  abstract = 	 { We propose a differentially private data generation paradigm using random feature representations of kernel mean embeddings when comparing the distribution of true data with that of synthetic data. We exploit the random feature representations for two important benefits. First, we require a minimal privacy cost for training deep generative models. This is because unlike kernel-based distance metrics that require computing the kernel matrix on all pairs of true and synthetic data points, we can detach the data-dependent term from the term solely dependent on synthetic data. Hence, we need to perturb the data-dependent term once and for all and then use it repeatedly during the generator training. Second, we can obtain an analytic sensitivity of the kernel mean embedding as the random features are norm bounded by construction. This removes the necessity of hyper-parameter search for a clipping norm to handle the unknown sensitivity of a generator network. We provide several variants of our algorithm, differentially-private mean embeddings with random features (DP-MERF) to jointly generate labels and input features for datasets such as heterogeneous tabular data and image data. Our algorithm achieves drastically better privacy-utility trade-offs than existing methods when tested on several datasets. }

  abstract = 	 {Membership inference is one of the simplest privacy threats faced by machine learning models that are trained on private sensitive data. In this attack, an adversary infers whether a particular point was used to train the model, or not, by observing the model’s predictions. Whereas current attack methods all require access to the model’s predicted confidence score, we introduce a label-only attack that instead evaluates the robustness of the model’s predicted (hard) labels under perturbations of the input, to infer membership. Our label-only attack is not only as-effective as attacks requiring access to confidence scores, it also demonstrates that a class of defenses against membership inference, which we call “confidence masking” because they obfuscate the confidence scores to thwart attacks, are insufficient to prevent the leakage of private information. Our experiments show that training with differential privacy or strong L2 regularization are the only current defenses that meaningfully decrease leakage of private information, even for points that are outliers of the training distribution.}
