  abstract = 	 {We investigate penalized maximum log-likelihood estimation for exponential family distributions whose natural parameter resides in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Key to our approach is a novel technique, doubly dual embedding, that avoids computation of the partition function. This technique also allows the development of a flexible sampling strategy that amortizes the cost of Monte-Carlo sampling in the inference stage. The resulting estimator can be easily generalized to kernel conditional exponential families. We establish a connection between kernel exponential family estimation and MMD-GANs, revealing a new perspective for understanding GANs. Compared to the score matching based estimators, the proposed method improves both memory and time efficiency while enjoying stronger statistical properties, such as fully capturing smoothness in its statistical convergence rate while the score matching estimator appears to saturate. Finally, we show that the proposed estimator  empirically outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both kernel exponential family estimation and its conditional extension.}

In both contexts, we demonstrate that dynamic position auctions converge to their associated static, envy-free equilibria. Furthermore, convergence is efficient, and the entry of low-quality advertisers does not slow convergence. Because our approach predominantly relies on assumptions common in the sponsored search literature, our results suggest that dynamic position auctions converge more generally.},

The fundamental difficulty is that the Bellman operator may become an expansion in general, resulting in oscillating and even divergent behavior of popular algorithms like Q-learning. In this paper, we revisit the Bellman equation, and reformulate it into a novel primal-dual optimization problem using Nesterov’s smoothing technique and the Legendre-Fenchel transformation. We then develop a new algorithm, called Smoothed Bellman Error Embedding, to solve this optimization problem where any differentiable function class may be used. We provide what we believe to be the first convergence guarantee for general nonlinear function approximation, and analyze the algorithm’s sample complexity. Empirically, our algorithm compares favorably to state-of-the-art baselines in several benchmark control problems.}

By the proportional response dynamics, each buyer allocates his budget proportional to the utility he receives from each good in the previous time period. Unlike the tatonnement process and its variants, the proportional response dynamics is a large step discrete dynamics, and the buyers do not solve any optimization problem at each step. In addition, the goods are always cleared and assigned to the buyers proportional to their bids at each step. Despite its simplicity, the dynamics converges fast for strictly concave CES utility functions, matching the best upper-bound of computing the market equilibrium via the solution of a global convex optimization problem.},

If n is the number of goods, we show, under certain assumptions on preferences and prices, that the order of magnitude of the norm of the income derivative of demand is 1/√n. As a corollary we get that for the case of a single price change the percentage error in approximating the Hicksian Deadweight Loss by its Marshallian counterpart goes to zero at least at the rate 1/√n and that demand is downward sloping for n large enough.},

abstract = {Publisher Summary
This chapter discusses some problems of proving the existence of equilibrium in a monetary economy. Most theories in economics involve the equilibrium solutions of certain models. These solutions are used as benchmarks, or as states to which an economic system is believed to tend or as the means for making long-term predictions. Implicitly or explicitly most economists use the notion of an equilibrium. It is evident that a proof of the existence of equilibrium that turns crucially on a supposition is hardly acceptable. The role of this assumption is simply to enable one to employ a technical trick to ensure that one can use a fixed point theorem and one cannot believe that it has any fundamental significance to the whole problem. The trick of course was to keep the exchange value of money strictly positive throughout so that money was always desirable and to obtain the desired continuity be varying initial total stocks knowing that once an equilibrium was found the actual initial stock distribution could be restored without upsetting the equilibrium.}

We derive lower bounds on the communication complexity of reaching a Nash equilibrium, i.e., on the number of bits that need to be transmitted, and thus also on the required number of steps. Specifically, we show lower bounds that are exponential in the number of players in each one of the following cases: (1) reaching a pure Nash equilibrium; (2) reaching a pure Nash equilibrium in a Bayesian setting; and (3) reaching a mixed Nash equilibrium. We then show that, in contrast, the communication complexity of reaching a correlated equilibrium is polynomial in the number of players.}

abstract = {Designing distributed algorithms that converge quickly to an equilibrium is one of the foremost research goals in algorithmic game theory, and convex programs have played a crucial role in the design of algorithms for Fisher markets. In this paper we shed new light on both aspects for Fisher markets with linear and spending constraint utilities. We show fast convergence of the Proportional Response dynamics recently introduced by Wu and Zhang. The convergence is obtained from a new perspective: we show that the Proportional Response dynamics is equivalent to a gradient descent algorithm (with respect to a Bregman divergence instead of euclidean distance) on a convex program that captures the equilibria for linear utilities. We further show that the convex program program easily extends to the case of spending constraint utilities, thus resolving an open question raised by Vazirani. This also gives a way to extend the Proportional Response dynamics to spending constraint utilties. We also prove a technical result that is interesting in its own right: that the gradient descent algorithm based on a Bregman divergence converges with rate O(1/t) under a condition that is weaker than having Lipschitz continuous gradient (which is the usual assumption in the optimization literature for obtaining the same rate).},

abstract = {One of the main reasons of the recent success of peer to peer (P2P)file sharing systems such as BitTorrent is their built-in tit-for-tat mechanism. In this paper, we model the bandwidth allocation in a P2P system as an exchange economy and study a tit-for-tat dynamics, namely the proportional response dynamics, in this economy. In a proportional response dynamics each player distributes its good to its neighbors proportional to the utility it received from them in thelast period. We show that this dynamics not only converges but converges to a market equilibrium, a standard economic characterization of efficient exchanges in a competitive market. In addition, for some classes of utility functions we consider, it converges much faster than the classical tat process and any existingalgorithms for computing market equilibria.As a part of our proof we study the double normalization of a matrix, an operation that linearly scales the rows of a matrix sothat each row sums to a prescribed positive number, followed by a similar scaling of the columns. We show that the iterative double normalization process of any non-negative matrix always converges. This complements the previous studies in matrix scaling that has focused on the convergence condition of the process when the row and column normalizations are considered as separate steps.},

abstract = {The Fisher market model is one of the most fundamental resource allocation models in economics. In a Fisher market, the prices and allocations of goods are determined according to the preferences and budgets of buyers to clear the market.In a Fisher market game, however, buyers are strategic and report their preferences over goods; the market-clearing prices and allocations are then determined based on their reported preferences rather than their real preferences. We show that the Fisher market game always has a pure Nash equilibrium, for buyers with linear, Leontief, and Cobb-Douglas utility functions, which are three representative classes of utility functions in the important Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) family. Furthermore, to quantify the social efficiency, we prove Price of Anarchy bounds for the game when the utility functions of buyers fall into these three classes respectively.},

abstract = {Tatonnement is a simple and natural rule for updating prices in Exchange (Arrow-Debreu) markets. In this paper we define a class of markets for which tatonnement is equivalent to gradient descent. This is the class of markets for which there is a convex potential function whose gradient is always equal to the negative of the excess demand and we call it Convex Potential Function (CPF) markets. We show the following results. CPF markets contain the class of Eisenberg Gale (EG) markets, defined previously by Jain and Vazirani. The subclass of CPF markets for which the demand is a differentiable function contains exactly those markets whose demand function has a symmetric negative semi-definite Jacobian. We define a family of continuous versions of tatonnement based on gradient descent using a Bregman divergence. As we show, all processes in this family converge to an equilibrium for any CPF market. This is analogous to the classic result for markets satisfying the Weak Gross Substitutes property. A discrete version of tatonnement converges toward the equilibrium for the following markets of complementary goods; its convergence rate for these settings is analyzed using a common potential function. Fisher markets in which all buyers have Leontief utilities. The tatonnement process reduces the distance to the equilibrium, as measured by the potential function, to an ε fraction of its initial value in O(1/ε) rounds of price updates. Fisher markets in which all buyers have complementary CES utilities. Here, the distance to the equilibrium is reduced to an ε fraction of its initial value in O(log(1/ε)) rounds of price updates.This shows that tatonnement converges for the entire range of Fisher markets when buyers have complementary CES utilities, in contrast to prior work, which could analyze only the substitutes range, together with a small portion of the complementary range.},
