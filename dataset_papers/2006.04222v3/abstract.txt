Multi-agent settings in the real world often involve tasks with varying types
and quantities of agents and non-agent entities; however, common patterns of
behavior often emerge among these agents/entities. Our method aims to leverage
these commonalities by asking the question: ``What is the expected utility of
each agent when only considering a randomly selected sub-group of its observed
entities?'' By posing this counterfactual question, we can recognize
state-action trajectories within sub-groups of entities that we may have
encountered in another task and use what we learned in that task to inform our
prediction in the current one. We then reconstruct a prediction of the full
returns as a combination of factors considering these disjoint groups of
entities and train this ``randomly factorized" value function as an auxiliary
objective for value-based multi-agent reinforcement learning. By doing so, our
model can recognize and leverage similarities across tasks to improve learning
efficiency in a multi-task setting. Our approach, Randomized Entity-wise
Factorization for Imagined Learning (REFIL), outperforms all strong baselines
by a significant margin in challenging multi-task StarCraft micromanagement
settings.
