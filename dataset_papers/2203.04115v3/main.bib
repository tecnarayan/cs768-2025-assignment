@article{aptamer-cancer,
abstract = {Aptamer-related technologies represent a revolutionary advancement in the capacity to rapidly develop new classes of targeting ligands. Structurally distinct RNA and DNA oligonucleotides, apt\
amers mimic small, protein-binding molecules and exhibit high binding affinity and selectivity. Although their molecular weight is relatively small-approximately one-tenth that of monoclonal antibodies-t\
heir complex tertiary folded structures create sufficient recognition surface area for tight interaction with target molecules. Additionally, unlike antibodies, aptamers can be readily chemically synthes\
ized and modified. In addition, aptamers' long storage period and low immunogenicity are favorable properties for clinical utility. Due to their flexibility of chemical modification, aptamers are conjuga\
ted to other chemical entities including chemotherapeutic agents, siRNA, nanoparticles, and solid phase surfaces for therapeutic and diagnostic applications. However, as relatively small sized oligonucle\
otides, aptamers present several challenges for successful clinical translation. Their short plasma half-lives due to nuclease degradation and rapid renal excretion necessitate further structural modific\
ation of aptamers for clinical application. Since the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the first aptamer drug, Macugen({\textregistered}) (pegaptanib), which treats wet-age-related macul\
ar degeneration, several aptamer therapeutics for oncology have followed and shown promise in pre-clinical models as well as clinical trials. This review discusses the advantages and challenges of aptame\
rs and introduces therapeutic aptamers under investigation and in clinical trials for cancer treatments.},

abstract="The monitoring of specific molecules in the living body has historically required sample removal (e.g., blood draws, microdialysis) followed by analysis via cumbersome, laboratory-bound process\
es. Those few exceptions to this rule (e.g., glucose, pyruvate, the monoamines) are monitored using ``one-off'' technologies reliant on the specific enzymatic or redox reactivity of their targets, and th\
us not generalizable to the measurement of other targets. In response we have developed in vivo electrochemical aptamer-based (E-AB) sensors, a modular, receptor-based measurement technology that is inde\
pendent of the chemical reactivity of its targets, and thus has the potential to be generalizable to a wide range of analytes. To further the adoption of this in vivo molecular measurement approach by ot\
her researchers and to accelerate its ultimate translation to the clinic, we present here our standard protocols for the fabrication and use of intravenous E-AB sensors.",

@article{Dale,
abstract = {This brief review recounts how, stimulated by the work of Geoff Burnstock, I developed biosensors that allowed direct real-time measurement of ATP and adenosine during neural function. The in\
itial impetus to create an adenosine biosensor came from trying to understand how ATP and adenosine-modulated motor pattern generation in the frog embryo spinal cord. Early biosensor measurements demonst\
rated slow accumulation of adenosine during motor activity. Subsequent application of these biosensors characterized real-time release of adenosine in in vitro models of brain ischaemia, and this line of\
 work has recently led to clinical measurements of whole blood purine levels in patients undergoing carotid artery surgery or stroke. In parallel, the wish to understand the role of ATP signalling in the\
 chemosensory regulation of breathing stimulated the development of ATP biosensors. This revealed that release of ATP from the chemosensory areas of the medulla oblongata preceded adaptive changes in bre\
athing, triggered adaptive changes in breathing via activation of P2 receptors, and ultimately led to the discovery of connexin26 as a channel that mediates CO2-gated release of ATP from cells.},
