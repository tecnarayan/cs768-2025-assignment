When training with Dropout, a randomly selected subset of activations are set to zero within each layer. DropConnect instead sets a randomly selected subset of weights within the network to zero. Each unit thus receives input from a random subset of units in the previous layer. We derive a bound on the generalization performance of both Dropout and DropConnect. We then evaluate DropConnect on a range of datasets, comparing to Dropout, and show state-of-the-art results on several image recoginition benchmarks can be obtained by aggregating multiple DropConnect-trained models.},

However, in the stochastic setting, counterexamples exist and prevent Nesterov's momentum from providing similar acceleration, even if the underlying problem is convex and finite-sum. We introduce $\mathtt{Katyusha}$, a direct, primal-only stochastic gradient method to fix this issue. In convex finite-sum stochastic optimization, $\mathtt{Katyusha}$ has an optimal accelerated convergence rate, and enjoys an optimal parallel linear speedup in the mini-batch setting. The main ingredient is $\textit{Katyusha momentum}$, a novel "negative momentum" on top of Nesterov's momentum. It can be incorporated into a variance-reduction based algorithm and speed it up, both in terms of $\textit{sequential and parallel}$ performance. Since variance reduction has been successfully applied to a growing list of practical problems, our paper suggests that in each of such cases, one could potentially try to give Katyusha a hug.},

  abstract      = {Recently, {\it stochastic momentum} methods have been widely adopted in training deep neural networks. However, their convergence analysis is still underexplored at the moment, in particular for non-convex optimization. This paper fills the gap between practice and theory by developing a basic convergence analysis of two stochastic momentum methods, namely stochastic heavy-ball method and the stochastic variant of Nesterov's accelerated gradient method. We hope that the basic convergence results developed in this paper can serve the reference to the convergence of stochastic momentum methods and also serve the baselines for comparison in future development of stochastic momentum methods. The novelty of convergence analysis presented in this paper is a unified framework, revealing more insights about the similarities and differences between different stochastic momentum methods and stochastic gradient method. The unified framework exhibits a continuous change from the gradient method to Nesterov's accelerated gradient method and finally the heavy-ball method incurred by a free parameter, which can help explain a similar change observed in the testing error convergence behavior for deep learning. Furthermore, our empirical results for optimizing deep neural networks demonstrate that the stochastic variant of Nesterov's accelerated gradient method achieves a good tradeoff (between speed of convergence in training error and robustness of convergence in testing error) among the three stochastic methods.},

In this paper, we demonstrate the sensitivity of optimizer comparisons to the hyperparameter tuning protocol. Our findings suggest that the hyperparameter search space may be the single most important factor explaining the rankings obtained by recent empirical comparisons in the literature. In fact, we show that these results can be contradicted when hyperparameter search spaces are changed. As tuning effort grows without bound, more general optimizers should never underperform the ones they can approximate (i.e., Adam should never perform worse than momentum), but recent attempts to compare optimizers either assume these inclusion relationships are not practically relevant or restrict the hyperparameters in ways that break the inclusions. In our experiments, we find that inclusion relationships between optimizers matter in practice and always predict optimizer comparisons. In particular, we find that the popular adaptive gradient methods never underperform momentum or gradient descent. We also report practical tips around tuning often ignored hyperparameters of adaptive gradient methods and raise concerns about fairly benchmarking optimizers for neural network training.},

  abstract      = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9% top-5 validation error (and 4.8% test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

The popular belief is that this effectiveness stems from controlling the change of the layers' input distributions during training to reduce the so-called "internal covariate shift". In this work, we demonstrate that such distributional stability of layer inputs has little to do with the success of BatchNorm. Instead, we uncover a more fundamental impact of BatchNorm on the training process: it makes the optimization landscape significantly smoother.

It mainly results from the asymmetry nature of crystal structures and the complicated step morphologies and related reconstructions of these surface configurations. Here we propose a general approach to calculate the absolute formation energies of wurtzite semi-polar surfaces by first-principles calculations, taking GaN as an example. We mainly focused on two commonly seen sets of semi-polar surfaces: a-family (11-2X) and m-family (10-1X). For all the semi-polar surfaces that we have calculated in this paper, the self-consistent accuracy is within 1.5 meV/{\AA}^2. Our work fills the last technical gap to fully investigate and understand the shape and morphology of compound semiconductors.},

When the function is smooth enough, we show that acceleration can be achieved by a stable discretization of this ODE using standard Runge-Kutta integrators. Specifically, we prove that under Lipschitz-gradient, convexity and order-$(s+2)$ differentiability assumptions, the sequence of iterates generated by discretizing the proposed second-order ODE converges to the optimal solution at a rate of $\mathcal{O}({N^{-2\frac{s}{s+1}}})$, where $s$ is the order of the Runge-Kutta numerical integrator. Furthermore, we introduce a new local flatness condition on the objective, under which rates even faster than $\mathcal{O}(N^{-2})$ can be achieved with low-order integrators and only gradient information. Notably, this flatness condition is satisfied by several standard loss functions used in machine learning. We provide numerical experiments that verify the theoretical rates predicted by our results.},

  abstract      = {We provide a theoretical explanation for the effectiveness of gradient clipping in training deep neural networks. The key ingredient is a new smoothness condition derived from practical neural network training examples. We observe that gradient smoothness, a concept central to the analysis of first-order optimization algorithms that is often assumed to be a constant, demonstrates significant variability along the training trajectory of deep neural networks. Further, this smoothness positively correlates with the gradient norm, and contrary to standard assumptions in the literature, it can grow with the norm of the gradient. These empirical observations limit the applicability of existing theoretical analyses of algorithms that rely on a fixed bound on smoothness. These observations motivate us to introduce a novel relaxation of gradient smoothness that is weaker than the commonly used Lipschitz smoothness assumption. Under the new condition, we prove that two popular methods, namely, \emph{gradient clipping} and \emph{normalized gradient}, converge arbitrarily faster than gradient descent with fixed stepsize. We further explain why such adaptively scaled gradient methods can accelerate empirical convergence and verify our results empirically in popular neural network training settings.},

Standard results on optimal convergence rates for stochastic optimization assume either there exists a uniform bound on the moments of the gradient noise, or that the noise decays as the algorithm progresses. These assumptions do not match the empirical behavior of optimization algorithms used in neural network training where the noise level in stochastic gradients could even increase with time. We address this behavior by studying convergence rates of stochastic gradient methods subject to changing second moment (or variance) of the stochastic oracle as the iterations progress. When the variation in the noise is known, we show that it is always beneficial to adapt the step-size and exploit the noise variability. When the noise statistics are unknown, we obtain similar improvements by developing an online estimator of the noise level, thereby recovering close variants of RMSProp.

  abstract      = {Heterostructures of wurtzite based devices have attracted great research interests since the tremendous success of GaN in light emitting diodes (LED) industry. Among the possible heterostructure material candidates, high quality GaN thin films on inexpensive and lattice matched ZnO substrate are both commercially and technologically desirable. However, the energy of ZnO polar surfaces is much lower than that of GaN polar surfaces. Therefore, the intrinsic wetting condition forbids such heterostructures. As a result, poor crystal quality and 3D growth mode were obtained. To dramatically change the growth mode of the heterostructure, we propose to use hydrogen as a surfactant, confirmed by our first principles calculations. Stable H involved surface configurations and interfaces are investigated, with the help of newly developed algorithms. By applying the experimental Gibbs free energy of H$_2$, we also predict the temperature and chemical potential of H, which is critical in experimental realizations of our strategy. This novel approach will for the first time make the growth of high quality GaN thin films on ZnO substrates possible. We believe that our new strategy may reduce the manufactory cost and improve the crystal quality and the efficiency of GaN based devices.},

  abstract      = {There is a large discrepancy between the experimental observations and the theoretical predictions in the morphology of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) nanosheets. Theoretically-predicted hexagons terminated by armchair edges are not observed in experiments; and experimentally-observed triangles terminated by zigzag edges are found theoretically unstable. There are two key issues in theoretical investigations, namely, an efficient and accurate algorithm of absolute formation energy of h-BN edges, and a good understanding of the role of hydrogen passivation during h-BN growth. Here, we first proposed an efficient algorithm to calculate asymmetric edges with a self-consistent accuracy of about 0.0014 eV/{\AA}. This method can also potentially serve as a standard approach for other two-dimensional (2D) compound materials. Then, by using this method, we discovered that only when edges are passivated by hydrogen atoms and temperature effects are taken into account can experimental morphology be explained. We further employed Wulff construction to obtain the equilibrium shapes of H-passivated h-BN nanosheets under its typical growth conditions at T = 1300 K and p = 1 bar, and found out that the equilibrium shapes are sensitive to hydrogen passivation and the growth conditions. Our results resolved long-standing discrepancies between experimental observations and theoretical analysis, explaining the thermodynamic driving force of the triangular, truncated triangular, and hexagonal shapes, and revealing the key role of hydrogen in h-BN growth. These discoveries and the advancement in algorithm may open the gateway towards the realization of 2D electronic and spintronic devices based on h-BN.},

Existing work addressing label shift usually assumes access to an \emph{unlabelled} test sample. This sample may be used to estimate the test label distribution, and to then train a suitably re-weighted classifier. While approaches using this idea have proven effective, their scope is limited as it is not always feasible to access the target domain; further, they require repeated retraining if the model is to be deployed in \emph{multiple} test environments. Can one instead learn a \emph{single} classifier that is robust to arbitrary label shifts from a broad family? In this paper, we answer this question by proposing a model that minimises an objective based on distributionally robust optimisation (DRO). We then design and analyse a gradient descent-proximal mirror ascent algorithm tailored for large-scale problems to optimise the proposed objective. %, and establish its convergence. Finally, through experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, we show that our technique can significantly improve performance over a number of baselines in settings where label shift is present.},

  abstract      = {In recent years, significant progress has been made in solving challenging problems across various domains using deep reinforcement learning (RL). Reproducing existing work and accurately judging the improvements offered by novel methods is vital to sustaining this progress. Unfortunately, reproducing results for state-of-the-art deep RL methods is seldom straightforward. In particular, non-determinism in standard benchmark environments, combined with variance intrinsic to the methods, can make reported results tough to interpret. Without significance metrics and tighter standardization of experimental reporting, it is difficult to determine whether improvements over the prior state-of-the-art are meaningful. In this paper, we investigate challenges posed by reproducibility, proper experimental techniques, and reporting procedures. We illustrate the variability in reported metrics and results when comparing against common baselines and suggest guidelines to make future results in deep RL more reproducible. We aim to spur discussion about how to ensure continued progress in the field by minimizing wasted effort stemming from results that are non-reproducible and easily misinterpreted.},

  abstract      = {In this paper, we focus on quantifying model stability as a function of random seed by investigating the effects of the induced randomness on model performance and the robustness of the model in general. We specifically perform a controlled study on the effect of random seeds on the behaviour of attention, gradient-based and surrogate model based (LIME) interpretations. Our analysis suggests that random seeds can adversely affect the consistency of models resulting in counterfactual interpretations. We propose a technique called Aggressive Stochastic Weight Averaging (ASWA)and an extension called Norm-filtered Aggressive Stochastic Weight Averaging (NASWA) which improves the stability of models over random seeds. With our ASWA and NASWA based optimization, we are able to improve the robustness of the original model, on average reducing the standard deviation of the model's performance by 72%.},

  abstract      = {Standard training techniques for neural networks involve multiple sources of randomness, e.g., initialization, mini-batch ordering and in some cases data augmentation. Given that neural networks are heavily over-parameterized in practice, such randomness can cause {\em churn} -- for the same input, disagreements between predictions of the two models independently trained by the same algorithm, contributing to the `reproducibility challenges' in modern machine learning. In this paper, we study this problem of churn, identify factors that cause it, and propose two simple means of mitigating it. We first demonstrate that churn is indeed an issue, even for standard image classification tasks (CIFAR and ImageNet), and study the role of the different sources of training randomness that cause churn. By analyzing the relationship between churn and prediction confidences, we pursue an approach with two components for churn reduction. First, we propose using \emph{minimum entropy regularizers} to increase prediction confidences. Second, \changes{we present a novel variant of co-distillation approach~\citep{anil2018large} to increase model agreement and reduce churn}. We present empirical results showing the effectiveness of both techniques in reducing churn while improving the accuracy of the underlying model.},
