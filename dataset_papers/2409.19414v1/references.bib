Cross-lingual KG alignment is the task of matching entities with their counterparts in different languages, which is an important way to enrich the cross-lingual links in multilingual KGs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for cross-lingual KG alignment via graph convolutional networks (GCNs). Given a set of pre-aligned entities, our approach trains GCNs to embed entities of each language into a unified vector space. Entity alignments are discovered based on the distances between entities in the embedding space. Embeddings can be learned from both the structural and attribute information of entities, and the results of structure embedding and attribute embedding are combined to get accurate alignments. In the experiments on aligning real multilingual KGs, our approach gets the best performance compared with other embedding-based KG alignment approaches.",

abstract = {Low-dimensional embeddings of nodes in large graphs have proved extremely useful in a variety of prediction tasks, from content recommendation to identifying protein functions. However, most existing approaches require that all nodes in the graph are present during training of the embeddings; these previous approaches are inherently transductive and do not naturally generalize to unseen nodes. Here we present GraphSAGE, a general inductive framework that leverages node feature information (e.g., text attributes) to efficiently generate node embeddings for previously unseen data. Instead of training individual embeddings for each node, we learn a function that generates embeddings by sampling and aggregating features from a node's local neighborhood. Our algorithm outperforms strong baselines on three inductive node-classification benchmarks: we classify the category of unseen nodes in evolving information graphs based on citation and Reddit post data, and we show that our algorithm generalizes to completely unseen graphs using a multi-graph dataset of protein-protein interactions.},

abstract = {In many machine learning problems the output should not depend on the order of the input. Such "permutation invariant" functions have been studied extensively recently. Here we argue that temporal architectures such as RNNs are highly relevant for such problems, despite the inherent dependence of RNNs on order. We show that RNNs can be regularized towards permutation invariance, and that this can result in compact models, as compared to non-recurrent architectures. We implement this idea via a novel form of stochastic regularization.Existing solutions mostly suggest restricting the learning problem to hypothesis classes which are permutation invariant by design [Zaheer et al., 2017, Lee et al., 2019, Murphy et al., 2018]. Our approach of enforcing permutation invari-ance via regularization gives rise to models which are semi permutation invariant (e.g. invariant to some permutations and not to others). We show that our method outperforms other permutation invariant approaches on synthetic and real world datasets.},
