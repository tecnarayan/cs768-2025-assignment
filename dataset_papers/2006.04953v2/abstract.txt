We consider the setting where players run the Hedge algorithm or its
optimistic variant to play an $n$-action game repeatedly for $T$ rounds.
  1) For two-player games, we show that the regret of optimistic Hedge decays
at $\tilde{O}( 1/T ^{5/6} )$, improving the previous bound $O(1/T^{3/4})$ by
Syrgkanis, Agarwal, Luo and Schapire (NIPS'15)
  2) In contrast, we show that the convergence rate of vanilla Hedge is no
better than $\tilde{\Omega}(1/ \sqrt{T})$, addressing an open question posted
in Syrgkanis, Agarwal, Luo and Schapire (NIPS'15).
  For general m-player games, we show that the swap regret of each player
decays at rate $\tilde{O}(m^{1/2} (n/T)^{3/4})$ when they combine optimistic
Hedge with the classical external-to-internal reduction of Blum and Mansour
(JMLR'07). The algorithm can also be modified to achieve the same rate against
itself and a rate of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n/T})$ against adversaries. Via standard
connections, our upper bounds also imply faster convergence to coarse
correlated equilibria in two-player games and to correlated equilibria in
multiplayer games.
