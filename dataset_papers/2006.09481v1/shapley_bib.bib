  abstract  = "In 1966, W. Lucas [1] exhibited a 10 person game with no von
               Neumann-Morgenstern solution. D. Schmeidler [2] then originated
               the nucleolus, proved it exists for every game, is unique and is
               contained in the kernel and the bargaining set (thereby
               establishing the first elementary proof of their existence).
               Charnes' idea of defining solutions by use of uni- or
               poly-extremal principles involving comparison of coalitional
               worths and payoffs thereto was specialized by Charnes and
               Kortanek [3] to non-Archimedean linear programs characterizing
               and generalizing the nucleolus and to the class of convex
               nucleus solutions given by minimizing a convex function of the
               coalitional excesses subject to simple conditions like the
               payoff vector being a division of the grand coalition value or
               an imputation.",
