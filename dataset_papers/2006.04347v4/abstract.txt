Many practical tasks involve sampling sequentially without replacement (WoR)
from a finite population of size $N$, in an attempt to estimate some parameter
$\theta^\star$. Accurately quantifying uncertainty throughout this process is a
nontrivial task, but is necessary because it often determines when we stop
collecting samples and confidently report a result. We present a suite of tools
for designing confidence sequences (CS) for $\theta^\star$. A CS is a sequence
of confidence sets $(C_n)_{n=1}^N$, that shrink in size, and all contain
$\theta^\star$ simultaneously with high probability. We present a generic
approach to constructing a frequentist CS using Bayesian tools, based on the
fact that the ratio of a prior to the posterior at the ground truth is a
martingale. We then present Hoeffding- and empirical-Bernstein-type
time-uniform CSs and fixed-time confidence intervals for sampling WoR, which
improve on previous bounds in the literature and explicitly quantify the
benefit of WoR sampling.
