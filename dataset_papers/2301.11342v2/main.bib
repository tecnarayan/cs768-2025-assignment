Each type of data provides information that must be evaluated and assigned to a particular pathology during the diagnostic process. To streamline the diagnostic process in daily routine and avoid misdiagnosis, artificial intelligence methods (especially computer aided diagnosis and artificial neural networks) can be employed. These adaptive learning algorithms can handle diverse types of medical data and integrate them into categorized outputs. In this paper, we briefly review and discuss the philosophy, capabilities, and limitations of artificial neural networks in medical diagnosis through selected examples.},

High-performance concrete is a highly complex material, which makes modeling its behavior a very difficult task. This paper is aimed at demonstrating the possibilities of adapting artificial neural networks (ANN) to predict the compressive strength of high-performance concrete. A set of trial batches of HPC was produced in the laboratory and demonstrated satisfactory experimental results. This study led to the following conclusions: 1) A strength model based on ANN is more accurate than a model based on regression analysis; and 2) It is convenient and easy to use ANN models for numerical experiments to review the effects of the proportions of each variable on the concrete mix.},

This paper describes the DCS network and modifications to the parameter estimation procedure. The work represents one step towards an integrated real-time reconfiguration control architecture for rapid prototyping of new aircraft designs. Performance was evaluated using three off-line benchmarks and on-line nonlinear Virtual Reality simulation. Flight control was evaluated under scenarios including differential stabilator lock, soft sensor failure, control and stability derivative variations, and air turbulence.},

  abstract         = {Connectionist networks in which information is stored in weights on connections among simple processing units have attracted considerable interest in cognitive science. Much of the interest centers around two characteristics of these networks. First, the weights on connections between units need not be prewired by the model builder but rather may be established through training in which items to be learned are presented repeatedly to the network and the connection weights are adjusted in small increments according to a learning algorithm. Second, the networks may represent information in a distributed fashion. This chapter discusses the catastrophic interference in connectionist networks. Distributed representations established through the application of learning algorithms have several properties that are claimed to be desirable from the standpoint of modeling human cognition. These properties include content-addressable memory and so-called automatic generalization in which a network trained on a set of items responds correctly to other untrained items within the same domain. New learning may interfere catastrophically with old learning when networks are trained sequentially. The analysis of the causes of interference implies that at least some interference will occur whenever new learning may alter weights involved in representing old learning, and the simulation results demonstrate only that interference is catastrophic in some specific networks.},

  abstract         = {Neural networks have generated valuable Quantitative Structure-Activity/Property Relationships (QSAR/QSPR) models for a wide variety of small molecules and materials properties. They have grown in sophistication and many of their initial problems have been overcome by modern mathematical techniques. QSAR studies have almost always used so-called "shallow" neural networks in which there is a single hidden layer between the input and output layers. Recently, a new and potentially paradigm-shifting type of neural network based on Deep Learning has appeared. Deep learning methods have generated impressive improvements in image and voice recognition, and are now being applied to QSAR and QSAR modelling. This paper describes the differences in approach between deep and shallow neural networks, compares their abilities to predict the properties of test sets for 15 large drug data sets (the kaggle set), discusses the results in terms of the Universal Approximation theorem for neural networks, and describes how DNN may ameliorate or remove troublesome "activity cliffs" in QSAR data sets.},

  abstract         = {Neural networks can learn complex, non-convex functions, and it is challenging to guarantee their correct behavior in safety-critical contexts. Many approaches exist to find failures in networks (e.g., adversarial examples), but these cannot guarantee the absence of failures. Verification algorithms address this need and provide formal guarantees about a neural network by answering “yes or no” questions. For example, they can answer whether a violation exists within certain bounds. However, individual “yes or no" questions cannot answer qualitative questions such as “what is the largest error within these bounds”; the answers to these lie in the domain of optimization. Therefore, we propose strategies to extend existing verifiers to perform optimization and find: (i) the most extreme failure in a given input region and (ii) the minimum input perturbation required to cause a failure. A naive approach using a bisection search with an off-the-shelf verifier results in many expensive and overlapping calls to the verifier. Instead, we propose an approach that tightly integrates the optimization process into the verification procedure, achieving better runtime performance than the naive approach. We evaluate our approach implemented as an extension of Marabou, a state-of-the-art neural network verifier, and compare its performance with the bisection approach and MIPVerify, an optimization-based verifier. We observe complementary performance between our extension of Marabou and MIPVerify.},

  abstract         = {Multi–criteria decision–making is an increasingly accepted tool for decision–making in management. In this work, we highlight the application of a novel multi–objective evolutionary algorithm, NSGA–II, to the risk–return trade–off for a bank–loan portfolio manager. The manager of a bank operating in a competitive environment faces the standard goal of maximizing shareholder wealth. Specifically, this attempts to maximize the net worth of the bank, which in turn involves maximizing the net interest margin of the bank (among other factors, such as non–interest income). At the same time, there are significant regulatory constraints placed on the bank, such as the maintenance of adequate capital, interest–rate risk exposure, etc. The genetic algorithm–based technique used here obtains an approximation to the set of Pareto–optimal solutions which increases the decision flexibility available to the bank manager, and provides a visualization tool for one of the trade–offs involved. The algorithm is also computationally efficient and is contrasted with a traditional multi–objective function — the epsilon–constraint method.},

This evolution of analyzing complex data using methods aimed at prediction is also emerging within the field of quantitative criminology. In the context of crime analysis, the large amount of crime data available can be considered an example of big data, which could inform us about current and upcoming crime trends and patterns. A recent development in the analysis of this kind of data is predictive policing, which uses advanced statistical methods to make the most of these data to gain useable new insights and information, allowing police services to predict and anticipate future crime events. This article presents the results of a literature review, supplemented with key informant interviews, to give insight into what predictive policing is, how it can be used and implemented to anticipate crime, and what is known about its effectiveness. It also gives an overview of the currently known applications of predictive policing and their main characteristics.},

  abstract         = {Improving the efficiency of algorithms for fundamental computations can have a widespread impact, as it can affect the overall speed of a large amount of computations. Matrix multiplication is one such primitive task, occurring in many systems--from neural networks to scientific computing routines. The automatic discovery of algorithms using machine learning offers the prospect of reaching beyond human intuition and outperforming the current best human-designed algorithms. However, automating the algorithm discovery procedure is intricate, as the space of possible algorithms is enormous. Here we report a deep reinforcement learning approach based on AlphaZero1 for discovering efficient and provably correct algorithms for the multiplication of arbitrary matrices. Our agent, AlphaTensor, is trained to play a single-player game where the objective is finding tensor decompositions within a finite factor space. AlphaTensor discovered algorithms that outperform the state-of-the-art complexity for many matrix sizes. Particularly relevant is the case of 4 × 4 matrices in a finite field, where AlphaTensor’s algorithm improves on Strassen’s two-level algorithm for the first time, to our knowledge, since its discovery 50 years ago2. We further showcase the flexibility of AlphaTensor through different use-cases: algorithms with state-of-the-art complexity for structured matrix multiplication and improved practical efficiency by optimizing matrix multiplication for runtime on specific hardware. Our results highlight AlphaTensor’s ability to accelerate the process of algorithmic discovery on a range of problems, and to optimize for different criteria.},
