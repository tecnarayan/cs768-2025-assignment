This paper demonstrates how such constraints can be integrated into a backpropagation network through the architecture of the network.

A single network learns the entire recognition operation, going from the normalized image of the character to the final classification.}",

Conversely, the challenges of robotic problems provide both inspiration, impact, and validation for developments in reinforcement learning. The relationship between disciplines has sufficient promise to be likened to that between physics and mathematics. In this article, we attempt to strengthen the links between the two research communities by providing a survey of work in reinforcement learning for behavior generation in robots. We highlight both key challenges in robot reinforcement learning as well as notable successes. We discuss how contributions tamed the complexity of the domain and study the role of algorithms, representations, and prior knowledge in achieving these successes. As a result, a particular focus of our paper lies on the choice between model-based and model-free as well as between value-function-based and policy-search methods. By analyzing a simple problem in some detail we demonstrate how reinforcement learning approaches may be profitably applied, and we note throughout open questions and the tremendous potential for future research.}, journal = {Int.

abstract = {Multi-view learning is an emerging direction in machine learning which considers learning with multiple views to improve the generalization performance. Multi-view learning is also known as data fusion or data integration from multiple feature sets. Since the last survey of multi-view machine learning in early 2013, multi-view learning has made great progress and developments in recent years, and is facing new challenges. This overview first reviews theoretical underpinnings to understand the properties and behaviors of multi-view learning. Then multi-view learning methods are described in terms of three classes to offer a neat categorization and organization. For each category, representative algorithms and newly proposed algorithms are presented. The main feature of this survey is that we provide comprehensive introduction for the recent developments of multi-view learning methods on the basis of coherence with early methods. We also attempt to identify promising venues and point out some specific challenges which can hopefully promote further research in this rapidly developing field.}

  abstract = 	 {We consider the problem of inferring causal relationships between two or more passively observed variables. While the problem of such causal discovery has been extensively studied especially in the bivariate setting, the majority of current methods assume a linear causal relationship, and the few methods which consider non-linear dependencies usually make the assumption of additive noise. Here, we propose a framework through which we can perform causal discovery in the presence of general non-linear relationships. The proposed method is based on recent progress in non-linear independent component analysis and exploits the non-stationarity of observations in order to recover the underlying sources or latent disturbances. We show rigorously that in the case of bivariate causal discovery, such non-linear ICA can be used to infer the causal direction via a series of independence tests. We further propose an alternative measure of causal direction based on asymptotic approximations to the likelihood ratio, as well as an extension to multivariate causal discovery. We demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed method via a series of simulation studies and conclude with an application to neuroimaging data. }

  abstract = 	 {Identifiability is a desirable property of a statistical model: it implies that the true model parameters may be estimated to any desired precision, given sufficient computational resources and data. We study identifiability in the context of representation learning: discovering nonlinear data representations that are optimal with respect to some downstream task. When parameterized as deep neural networks, such representation functions lack identifiability in parameter space, because they are over-parameterized by design. In this paper, building on recent advances in nonlinear Independent Components Analysis, we aim to rehabilitate identifiability by showing that a large family of discriminative models are in fact identifiable in function space, up to a linear indeterminacy. Many models for representation learning in a wide variety of domains have been identifiable in this sense, including text, images and audio, state-of-the-art at time of publication. We derive sufficient conditions for linear identifiability and provide empirical support for the result on both simulated and real-world data.}

abstract = "We investigate particulate matter (PM2.5) data reliability in five major Chinese cities: Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu, and Shenyang by cross-validating data from the U.S. diplomatic posts and the nearby Ministry of Environmental Protection sites based on 3 years' data from January 2013. The investigation focuses on the consistency in air quality assessment derived from the two data sources. It consists of studying (i) the occurrence length and percentage of different PM2.5 concentration ranges; (ii) the air quality assessment for each city; and (iii) the winter-heating effects in Beijing and Shenyang. Our analysis indicates that the two data sources produced highly consistent air quality assessment in the five cities. This is encouraging as it would inject a much needed confidence on the air pollution measurements from China. We also provide air quality assessments on the severity and trends of the fine particulate matter pollution in the five cities. The assessments are produced by statistically constructing the standard monthly meteorological conditions for each city, which are designed to minimize the effects of confounding factors due to yearly variations of some important meteorological variables. Our studies show that Beijing and Chengdu had the worst air quality, while Guangzhou and Shanghai faired the best among the five cities. Most of the five cities had their PM2.5 concentration decreased significantly in the last 2 years. By linking the air quality with the amount of energy consumed, our study suggests that the geographical configuration is a significant factor in a city's air quality management and economic development.",
