Crowdsourcing is a popular paradigm for effectively collecting labels at low
cost. The Dawid-Skene estimator has been widely used for inferring the true
labels from the noisy labels provided by non-expert crowdsourcing workers.
However, since the estimator maximizes a non-convex log-likelihood function, it
is hard to theoretically justify its performance. In this paper, we propose a
two-stage efficient algorithm for multi-class crowd labeling problems. The
first stage uses the spectral method to obtain an initial estimate of
parameters. Then the second stage refines the estimation by optimizing the
objective function of the Dawid-Skene estimator via the EM algorithm. We show
that our algorithm achieves the optimal convergence rate up to a logarithmic
factor. We conduct extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is comparable to
the most accurate empirical approach, while outperforming several other
recently proposed methods.
