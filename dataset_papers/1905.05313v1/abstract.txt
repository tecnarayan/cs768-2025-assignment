In Generalized Linear Estimation (GLE) problems, we seek to estimate a signal
that is observed through a linear transform followed by a component-wise,
possibly nonlinear and noisy, channel. In the Bayesian optimal setting,
Generalized Approximate Message Passing (GAMP) is known to achieve optimal
performance for GLE. However, its performance can significantly degrade
whenever there is a mismatch between the assumed and the true generative model,
a situation frequently encountered in practice. In this paper, we propose a new
algorithm, named Generalized Approximate Survey Propagation (GASP), for solving
GLE in the presence of prior or model mis-specifications. As a prototypical
example, we consider the phase retrieval problem, where we show that GASP
outperforms the corresponding GAMP, reducing the reconstruction threshold and,
for certain choices of its parameters, approaching Bayesian optimal
performance. Furthermore, we present a set of State Evolution equations that
exactly characterize the dynamics of GASP in the high-dimensional limit.
