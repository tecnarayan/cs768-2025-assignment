Deep structured output learning shows great promise in tasks like semantic
image segmentation. We proffer a new, efficient deep structured model learning
scheme, in which we show how deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can be
used to estimate the messages in message passing inference for structured
prediction with Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). With such CNN message
estimators, we obviate the need to learn or evaluate potential functions for
message calculation. This confers significant efficiency for learning, since
otherwise when performing structured learning for a CRF with CNN potentials it
is necessary to undertake expensive inference for every stochastic gradient
iteration. The network output dimension for message estimation is the same as
the number of classes, in contrast to the network output for general CNN
potential functions in CRFs, which is exponential in the order of the
potentials. Hence CNN message learning has fewer network parameters and is more
scalable for cases that a large number of classes are involved. We apply our
method to semantic image segmentation on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset. We
achieve an intersection-over-union score of 73.4 on its test set, which is the
best reported result for methods using the VOC training images alone. This
impressive performance demonstrates the effectiveness and usefulness of our CNN
message learning method.
