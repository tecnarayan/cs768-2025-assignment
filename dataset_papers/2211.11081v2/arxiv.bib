Hence, for almost all graphs X, any graph Y can be easily tested for isomorphism to X by an extremely naive linear time algorithm. This result is based on the following: In almost all graphs on n vertices, the largest \$n^{0.15} \$ degrees are distinct. In fact, they are pairwise at least \$n^{0.03} \$ apart. }

abstract = {Naked mole-rats are known for their eusocial lifestyle, living in colonies that consist of many workers and a single breeding queen. Little is known about how individuals within these colonies navigate the many interactions that must occur in such a complex cooperative group. Barker et al. show that calls emitted by individuals, in particular the common “chirp” call, convey information specific to the animal's group (see the Perspective by Buffenstein). Group differences are cultural, rather than genetic, and are related to the queen: Cross-fostered pups adopt their rearing colony's dialects, and dialects change with queen replacement. Science, this issue p. 503; see also p. 461 Distinct colonies of naked mole-rats develop their own specific call dialects. Naked mole-rats (Heterocephalus glaber) form some of the most cooperative groups in the animal kingdom, living in multigenerational colonies under the control of a single breeding queen. Yet how they maintain this highly organized social structure is unknown. Here we show that the most common naked mole-rat vocalization, the soft chirp, is used to transmit information about group membership, creating distinctive colony dialects. Audio playback experiments demonstrate that individuals make preferential vocal responses to home colony dialects. Pups fostered in foreign colonies in early postnatal life learn the vocal dialect of their adoptive colonies, which suggests vertical transmission and flexibility of vocal signatures. Dialect integrity is partly controlled by the queen: Dialect cohesiveness decreases with queen loss and remerges only with the ascendance of a new queen.}}

                  any concept representable as a boolean function or
                  circuit, with the help of a teacher who breaks the
                  concept into subconcepts and teaches one subconcept
                  per lesson. Each subconcept corresponds to a gate in
                  the boolean circuit.  The learner learns each
                  subconcept from examples which have been randomly
                  drawn according to an arbitrary probability
                  distribution, and labeled as positive or negative
                  instances of the subconcept by the teacher. The
                  learning procedure runs in time polynomial in the
                  size of the circuit.  The learner outputs not the
                  unknown boolean circuit, but rather a program which,
                  for any input, either produces the same answer as
                  the unknown boolean circuit, or else says ``I don't
                  know.'' Thus the output of this learning procedure is
                  \emph{reliable}.  Furthermore, with high probability the
                  output program is nearly always \emph{useful} in that it
                  says ``I don't know'' very rarely. A key technique is
                  to maintain a hierarchy of explicit ``version
                  spaces.''  Our main contribution is thus a learning
                  procedure whose output is reliable and nearly always
                  useful; this has not been previously accomplished
                  within Valiant's model of learnability.

abstract = {ABSTRACT The evolution of language has been investigated by several research communities, including biologists and linguists, striving to highlight similar linguistic capacities across species. To date, however, no consensus exists on the linguistic capacities of non-human species. Major controversies remain on the use of linguistic terminology, analysis methods and behavioural data collection. The field of ‘animal linguistics’ has emerged to overcome these difficulties and attempt to reach uniform methods and terminology. This primer is a tutorial review of ‘animal linguistics’. It describes the linguistic concepts of semantics, pragmatics and syntax, and proposes minimal criteria to be fulfilled to claim that a given species displays a particular linguistic capacity. Second, it reviews relevant methods successfully applied to the study of communication in animals and proposes a list of useful references to detect and overcome major pitfalls commonly observed in the collection of animal behaviour data. This primer represents a step towards mutual understanding and fruitful collaborations between linguists and biologists.}
