	abstract = {Koopman operator theory has been successfully applied to problems from various research areas such as fluid dynamics, molecular dynamics, climate science, engineering, and biology. Applications include detecting metastable or coherent sets, coarse-graining, system identification, and control. There is an intricate connection between dynamical systems driven by stochastic differential equations and quantum mechanics. In this paper, we compare the ground-state transformation and Nelson’s stochastic mechanics and demonstrate how data-driven methods developed for the approximation of the Koopman operator can be used to analyze quantum physics problems. Moreover, we exploit the relationship between Schrödinger operators and stochastic control problems to show that modern data-driven methods for stochastic control can be used to solve the stationary or imaginary-time Schrödinger equation. Our findings open up a new avenue toward solving Schrödinger’s equation using recently developed tools from data science.}

Before the full power of such machines will be available, near-term quantum devices will provide several hundred qubits and limited error correction. Still, there is a realistic prospect to run useful algorithms within the limited circuit depth of such devices. Particularly promising are optimization algorithms that follow a hybrid approach: the aim is to steer a highly entangled state on a quantum system to a target state that minimizes a cost function via variation of some gate parameters. This variational approach can be used both for classical optimization problems as well as for problems in quantum chemistry. The challenge is to converge to the target state given the limited coherence time and connectivity of the qubits. In this context, the quantum volume as a metric to compare the power of near-term quantum devices is discussed. With focus on chemistry applications, a general description of variational algorithms is provided and the mapping from fermions to qubits is explained. Coupled-cluster and heuristic trial wave-functions are considered for efficiently finding molecular ground states. Furthermore, simple error-mitigation schemes are introduced that could improve the accuracy of determining ground-state energies. Advancing these techniques may lead to near-term demonstrations of useful quantum computation with systems containing several hundred qubits.}

abstract = {We present a formalism for comparing the asymptotic dynamics of dynamical systems with physical systems that they model based on the spectral properties of the Koopman operator. We first compare invariant measures and discuss this in terms of a “statistical Takens” theorem proved here. We also identify the need to go beyond comparing only invariant ergodic measures of systems and introduce an ergodic–theoretic treatment of a class of spectral functionals that allow for this. The formalism is extended for a class of stochastic systems: discrete Random Dynamical Systems. The ideas introduced in this paper can be used for parameter identification and model validation of driven nonlinear models with complicated behavior. As an illustration we provide an example in which we compare the asymptotic behavior of a combustion system measured experimentally with the asymptotic behavior of a class of models that have the form of a random dynamical system.}

abstract={Faster algorithms for combinatorial optimization could prove transformative for diverse areas such as logistics, finance and machine learning. Accordingly, the possibility of quantum enhanced optimization has driven much interest in quantum technologies. Here we demonstrate the application of the Google Sycamore superconducting qubit quantum processor to combinatorial optimization problems with the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). Like past QAOA experiments, we study performance for problems defined on the planar connectivity graph native to our hardware; however, we also apply the QAOA to the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick model and MaxCut, non-native problems that require extensive compilation to implement. For hardware-native problems, which are classically efficient to solve on average, we obtain an approximation ratio that is independent of problem size and observe that performance increases with circuit depth. For problems requiring compilation, performance decreases with problem size. Circuits involving several thousand gates still present an advantage over random guessing but not over some efficient classical algorithms. Our results suggest that it will be challenging to scale near-term implementations of the QAOA for problems on non-native graphs. As these graphs are closer to real-world instances, we suggest more emphasis should be placed on such problems when using the QAOA to benchmark quantum processors.},

    abstract = { Abstract. Kernel analog forecasting (KAF) is a methodology for data-driven, nonparametric forecasting of dynamically generated time series data. This approach has a rigorous foundation in Koopman operator theory and it produces good forecasts in practice, but it suffers from the heavy computational costs common to kernel methods. This paper proposes a streaming algorithm for KAF that only requires a single pass over the training data. This algorithm dramatically reduces the costs of training and prediction without sacrificing forecasting skill. Computational experiments demonstrate that the streaming KAF method can successfully forecast several classes of dynamical systems (periodic, quasi-periodic, and chaotic) in both data-scarce and data-rich regimes. The overall methodology may have wider interest as a new template for streaming kernel regression. }
