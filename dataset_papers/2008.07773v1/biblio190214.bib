  abstract = {As part of a collaboration with a major California school district, we study the problem of fairly allocating unused classrooms in public schools to charter schools. Our approach revolves around the randomized leximin mechanism. We extend previous work to the classroom allocation setting, showing that the leximin mechanism is proportional, envy-free, efficient, and group strategyproof. We also prove that the leximin mechanism provides a (worst-case) 4-approximation to the maximum number of classrooms that can possibly be allocated. Our experiments, which are based on real data, show that a nontrivial implementation of the leximin mechanism scales gracefully in terms of running time (even though the problem is intractable in theory), and performs extremely well with respect to a number of efficiency objectives. We take great pains to establish the practicability of our approach, and discuss issues related to its deployment.},

@article{Arapostathis1993,
abstract = {This work is a survey of the average cost control problem for discrete-time Markov processes. The authors have attempted to put together a comprehensive account of the considerable research on this problem over the past three decades. The exposition ranges from finite to Borel state and action spaces and includes a variety of methodologies to find and characterize optimal policies. The authors have included a brief historical perspective of the research efforts in this area and have compiled a substantial yet not exhaustive bibliography. The authors have also identified several important questions that are still open to investigation.},

@incollection{Kallenberg2003,
abstract = {In this chapter we study Markov decision processes (MDPs) with finite state and action spaces. This is the classical theory developed since the end of the fifties. We consider finite and infinite horizon models. For the finite horizon model the utility function of the total expected reward is commonly used. For the infinite horizon the utility function is less obvious. We consider several criteria: total discounted expected reward, average expected reward and more sensitive optimality criteria including the Blackwell optimality criterion. We end with a variety of other subjects. The emphasis is on computational methods to compute optimal policies for these criteria. These methods are based on concepts like value iteration, policy iteration and linear programming. This survey covers about three hundred papers. Although the subject of finite state and action MDPs is classical, there are still open problems. We also mention some of them},

@inproceedings{Zhang2014,
abstract = {We define a fairness solution criterion for multi-agent decision-making problems, where agents have local interests. This new criterion aims to maximize the worst performance of agents with a consideration on the overall performance. We develop a simple linear programming approach and a more scalable game-theoretic approach for computing an optimal fairness policy. This game-theoretic approach formulates this fairness optimization as a two-player zero-sum game and employs an iterative algorithm for finding a Nash equilibrium, corresponding to an optimal fairness policy. We scale up this approach by exploiting problem structure and value function approximation. Our experiments on resource allocation problems show that this fairness criterion provides a more favorable solution than the utilitarian criterion, and that our game-theoretic approach is significantly faster than linear programming.},

@inproceedings{Jiang2019,
abstract = {Fairness is essential for human society, contributing to stability and productivity. Similarly, fairness is also the key for many multi-agent systems. Taking fairness into multi-agent learning could help multi-agent systems become both efficient and stable. However, learning efficiency and fairness simultaneously is a complex, multi-objective, joint-policy optimization. To tackle these difficulties, we propose FEN, a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning model. We first decompose fairness for each agent and propose fair-efficient reward that each agent learns its own policy to optimize. To avoid multi-objective conflict, we design a hierarchy consisting of a controller and several sub-policies, where the controller maximizes the fair-efficient reward by switching among the sub-policies that provides diverse behaviors to interact with the environment. FEN can be trained in a fully decentralized way, making it easy to be deployed in real-world applications. Empirically, we show that FEN easily learns both fairness and efficiency and significantly outperforms baselines in a variety of multi-agent scenarios.},

@inproceedings{Cheung2019,
abstract = {We consider an agent who is involved in an online Markov Decision Process, and receives a vector of outcomes every round. The agent optimizes an aggregate reward function on the multi-dimensional outcomes. Due to state transitions, it is challenging to balance the contribution from each dimension for achieving near-optimality. Contrary to the single objective case, stationary policies are generally sub-optimal. We propose a no-regret algorithm based on the Frank-Wolfe algorithm (Frank and Wolfe 1956, Agrawal and Devanur 2014) , UCRL2 (Jaksch et al. 2010), as well as a crucial and novel Gradient Threshold Procedure (GTP). GTP involves carefully delaying gradient updates, and returns a non-stationary policy that diversifies the outcomes for optimizing the aggregate reward.},

@article{LamondPuterman89,
abstract = {A new self-contained approach based on the Drazin generalized inverse is used to derive many basic results in discrete time, finite state Markov decision processes. A product form representation for the transition matrix of a stationary policy gives new derivations of the average reward evaluation equations, Laurent series expansions, as well as the finite test for Blackwell optimality. This representation also suggests new computational methods. AMS(MOS) subject classifications. 15A09, 60J05, 90C40 1. Introduction. The purpose of this paper is to provide a simple and unified treatment of undiscounted Markov reward and decision process theory using purely algebraic methods. The cornerstone of this development is a matrix factorization of a stochastic matrix based on the Jordan canonical representation. All subsequent results are obtained using elementary linear algebra. Although the results obtained are not new, the approach herein is self-contained and more direct than the analytic methods of Blackwell (1962) and Veinott (1969).

	Abstract = {Reinforcement learning has had many successes, but in practice it often requires significant amounts of data to learn high-performing policies. One common way to improve learning is to allow a trained (source) agent to assist a new (target) agent. The goals in this setting are to 1) improve the target agent's performance, relative to learning unaided, and 2) allow the target agent to outperform the source agent. Our approach leverages source agent demonstrations, removing any requirements on the source agent's learning algorithm or representation. The target agent then estimates the source agent's policy and improves upon it. The key contribution of this work is to show that leveraging the target agent's uncertainty in the source agent's policy can significantly improve learning in two complex simulated domains, Keepaway and Mario.},

	Abstract = {We identify a fundamental source of error in Q-learning and other forms of dy-
namic programming with function approximation.
Delusional bias
arises when the
approximation architecture limits the class of expressible greedy policies. Since
standard Q-updates make globally uncoordinated action choices with respect to
the expressible policy class, inconsistent or even conflicting Q-value estimates
can result, leading to pathological behaviour such as over/under-estimation, insta-
bility and even divergence. To solve this problem, we introduce a new notion of
policy consistency
and define a local backup process that ensures global consis-
tency through the use of
information sets
---sets that record constraints on policies
consistent with backed-up Q-values.  We prove that both the model-based and
model-free algorithms using this backup remove delusional bias, yielding the first
known algorithms that guarantee optimal results under general conditions. These
algorithms furthermore only require polynomially many information sets (from a
potentially exponential support). Finally, we suggest other practical heuristics for
value-iteration and Q-learning that attempt to reduce delusional bias.},

	Abstract = {Recently, a novel class of Approximate Policy Iteration (API) algorithms have demonstrated impressive practical performance (e.g., ExIt from [1], AlphaGo-Zero from [2]). This new family of algorithms maintains, and alternately optimizes, two policies: a fast, reactive policy (e.g., a deep neural network) deployed at test time, and a slow, non-reactive policy (e.g., Tree Search), that can plan multiple steps ahead. The reactive policy is updated under supervision from the non-reactive policy, while the non-reactive policy is improved with guidance from the reactive policy. In this work we study this Dual Policy Iteration (DPI) strategy in an alternating optimization framework and provide a convergence analysis that extends existing API theory. We also develop a special instance of this framework which reduces the update of non-reactive policies to model-based optimal control using learned local models, and provides a theoretically sound way of unifying model-free and model-based RL approaches with unknown dynamics. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on various continuous control Markov Decision Processes.},

	Abstract = {Boltzmann exploration is a classic strategy for sequential decision-making under
uncertainty, and is one of the most standard tools in Reinforcement Learning (RL).
Despite its widespread use, there is virtually no theoretical understanding about
the limitations or the actual benefits of this exploration scheme.  Does it drive
exploration in a meaningful way? Is it prone to misidentifying the optimal actions
or spending too much time exploring the suboptimal ones? What is the right tuning
for the learning rate? In this paper, we address several of these questions for the
classic setup of stochastic multi-armed bandits. One of our main results is showing
that the Boltzmann exploration strategy with any monotone learning-rate sequence
will induce suboptimal behavior. As a remedy, we offer a simple non-monotone
schedule that guarantees near-optimal performance, albeit only when given prior
access  to  key  problem  parameters  that  are  typically  not  available  in  practical
situations (like the time horizon
T
and the suboptimality gap
∆
). More importantly,
we propose a novel variant that uses different learning rates for different arms, and
achieves a distribution-dependent regret bound of order
K
log
2
T
∆
and a distribution-
independent bound of order
√
KT
log
K
without requiring such prior knowledge.
To demonstrate the flexibility of our technique, we also propose a variant that
guarantees the same performance bounds even if the rewards are heavy-tailed.},

the effects of its actions are easier to predict;  we call such

benefit from independent theoretical analyses, these often
fail to extend to the practical situations in which the meth-

the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches by intro-
ducing a suite of test domains that can be varied for problem
size, stochasticity, function approximation, and partial ob-

characteristics for which each class of methods excels. We
investigate whether their strengths can be combined, and
develop an approach to achieve that purpose. The effective-

	Abstract = {The ability to act in multiple environments and transfer previous knowledge to
new situations can be considered a critical aspect of any intelligent agent.   To-
wards this goal, we define a novel method of multitask and transfer learning that
enables an autonomous agent to learn how to behave in multiple tasks simultane-
ously, and then generalize its knowledge to new domains.  This method, termed
``Actor-Mimic'', exploits the use of deep reinforcement learning and model com-
pression techniques to train a single policy network that learns how to act in a set
of distinct tasks by using the guidance of several expert teachers.  We then show
that the representations learnt by the deep policy network are capable of general-
izing to new tasks with no prior expert guidance, speeding up learning in novel
environments.  Although our method can in general be applied to a wide range
of problems, we use Atari games as a testing environment to demonstrate these
methods.},

	Abstract = {This paper investigates the problem of interactively learning behaviors communicated by a human teacher using positive and negative feedback. Much previous work on this problem has made the assumption that people provide feedback for decisions that is dependent on the behavior they are teaching and is independent from the learner's current policy. We present empirical results that show this assumption to be false---whether human trainers give a positive or negative feedback for a decision is influenced by the learner's current policy. Based on this insight, we introduce Convergent Actor-Critic by Humans (COACH), an algorithm for learning from policy-dependent feedback that converges to a local optimum. Finally, we demonstrate that COACH can successfully learn multiple behaviors on a physical robot.},

@inproceedings{KnoxStone09,
	Abstract = {As computational learning agents move into domains that incur real costs (e.g., autonomous driving or financial investment), it will be necessary to learn good policies without numerous high-cost learning trials. One promising approach to reducing sample complexity of learning a task is knowledge transfer from humans to agents. Ideally, methods of transfer should be accessible to anyone with task knowledge, regardless of that person's expertise in programming and AI. This paper focuses on allowing a human trainer to interactively shape an agent's policy via reinforcement signals. Specifically, the paper introduces "Training an Agent Manually via Evaluative Reinforcement," or TAMER, a framework that enables such shaping. Differing from previous approaches to interactive shaping, a tamer agent models the human's reinforcement and exploits its model by choosing actions expected to be most highly reinforced. Results from two domains demonstrate that lay users can train tamer agents without defining an environmental reward function (as in an MDP) and indicate that human training within the tamer framework can reduce sample complexity over autonomous learning algorithms.},

	Abstract = {Exploration remains a significant challenge to reinforcement learning methods, especially in environments where reward signals are sparse. Recent methods of learning from demonstrations have shown to be promising in overcoming exploration difficulties but typically require considerable high-quality demonstrations that are difficult to collect. We propose to effectively leverage available demonstrations to guide exploration through enforcing occupancy measure matching between the learned policy and current demonstrations, and develop a novel Policy Optimization from Demonstration (POfD) method. We show that POfD induces implicit dynamic reward shaping and brings provable benefits for policy improvement. Furthermore, it can be combined with policy gradient methods to produce state-of-the-art results, as demonstrated experimentally on a range of popular benchmark sparse-reward tasks, even when the demonstrations are few and imperfect.},

	Abstract = {Our goal is for AI systems to correctly identify and act according to their human user's objectives. Cooperative Inverse Reinforcement Learning (CIRL) formalizes this value alignment problem as a two-player game between a human and robot, in which only the human knows the parameters of the reward function: the robot needs to learn them as the interaction unfolds. Previous work showed that CIRL can be solved as a POMDP, but with an action space size exponential in the size of the reward parameter space. In this work, we exploit a specific property of CIRL: the human is a full information agent. This enables us to derive an optimality-preserving modification to the standard Bellman update, which reduces the complexity of the problem by an exponential factor. Additionally, we show that our modified Bellman update allows us to relax CIRL's assumption of human rationality. We apply this update to a variety of POMDP solvers, including exact methods, point-based methods, and Monte Carlo Tree Search methods. We find that it enables us to scale CIRL to non-trivial problems, with larger reward parameter spaces, and larger action spaces for both robot and human. In solutions to these larger problems, the human exhibits pedagogical (teaching) behavior, while the robot interprets it as such and attains higher value for the human.},

Our approach models the goal-directed trajectories of pedestrians using maximum entropy inverse optimal control. The advantage of this modeling approach is the generality of its learned cost function to changes in the environment and to entirely different environments. We employ the predictions of this model of pedestrian trajectories in a novel incremental planner and quantitatively show the improvement in hindrance-sensitive robot trajectory planning provided by our approach.},

	Abstract = {Recently, researchers have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on sequential prediction problems using deep neural networks and Reinforcement Learning (RL). For some of these problems, oracles that can demonstrate good performance may be available during training, but are not used by plain RL methods. To take advantage of this extra information, we propose AggreVaTeD, an extension of the Imitation Learning (IL) approach of Ross \& Bagnell (2014). AggreVaTeD allows us to use expressive differentiable policy representations such as deep networks, while leveraging training-time oracles to achieve faster and more accurate solutions with less training data. Specifically, we present two gradient procedures that can learn neural network policies for several problems, including a sequential prediction task and several high-dimensional robotics control problems. We also provide a comprehensive theoretical study of IL that demonstrates that we can expect up to exponentially-lower sample complexity for learning with AggreVaTeD than with plain RL algorithms. Our results and theory indicate that IL (and AggreVaTeD in particular) can be a more effective strategy for sequential prediction than plain RL.},

	Abstract = {We consider a nonhomogeneous infinite-horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP) problem with multiple optimal first-period policies. We seek an algorithm that, given finite data, delivers an optimal first-period policy. Such an algorithm can thus recursively generate, within a rolling-horizon procedure, an infinite-horizon optimal solution to the original problem. However, it can happen that no such algorithm exists, i.e., the MDP is not well posed . Equivalently, it is impossible to solve the problem with a finite amount of data. Assuming increasing marginal returns in actions (with respect to states) and stochastically increasing state transitions (with respect to actions), we provide an algorithm that is guaranteed to solve the given MDP whenever it is well posed. This algorithm determines, in finite time, a forecast horizon for which an optimal solution delivers an optimal first-period policy. As an application, we solve all well-posed instances of the time-varying version of the classic asset-selling problem.},

	Abstract = {In cooperative MASs, the interests of individual agents are usually consistent with that of the overall system. In the cases of conflicting interest, each agent is assumed to have the willingness to cooperate toward a common goal of the system even at the cost of sacrificing its own benefits. Therefore, the behaviors of each agent in cooperative environments can be determined by the designer(s) of the system, which thus allows for intricate coordination strategies to be implemented beforehand. To achieve effective coordinations among agents, one traditional approach is to employ a superagent to determine the behaviors for all other agents in the system. However, there exist a number of disadvantages by adopting this approach. First, the scalability problem will become serious when the number of agents is significantly increased, since the computational space of the superagent increases exponentially to the number of agents. Second, it explicitly requires the superagent to be able to communicate with all agents in the system and has the global information, which may not be possible in distributed environments, where the communication cost can be very high. Lastly, it makes the system very vulnerable since the malfunction of the superagent would lead to the failure of the whole system.},

	Abstract = {Computer vision systems require large amounts of manually annotated data to properly learn challenging visual concepts. Crowdsourcing platforms offer an inexpensive method to capture human knowledge and understanding, for a vast number of visual perception tasks. In this survey, we describe the types of annotations computer vision researchers have collected using crowdsourcing, and how they have ensured that this data is of high quality while annotation effort is minimized. We begin by discussing data collection on both classic (e.g., object recognition) and recent (e.g., visual story-telling) vision tasks. We then summarize key design decisions for creating effective data collection interfaces and workflows, and present strategies for intelligently selecting the most important data instances to annotate. Finally, we conclude with some thoughts on the future of crowdsourcing in computer vision.},

@inproceedings{PiotGeistPietquin14,
	Abstract = {This paper deals with the problem of learning from demonstrations, where an agent called the apprentice tries to learn a behavior from demonstrations of another agent called the expert. To address this problem, we place ourselves into the Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework, which is well suited for sequential decision making problems. A way to tackle this problem is to reduce it to classication but doing so we do not take into account the MDP structure. Other methods which take into account the MDP structure need to solve MDPs which is a dicult task and/or need a choice of features which is problem-dependent. The main contribution of the paper is to extend a large margin approach, which is a classication method, by adding a regularization term which takes into account the MDP structure. The derived algorithm, called Reward-regularized Classication for Apprenticeship Learning (RCAL), does not need to solve MDPs. But, the major advantage is that it can be boosted: this avoids the choice of features, which is a drawback of parametric approaches. A state of the art experiment (Highway) and generic experiments (structured Garnets) are conducted to show the performance of RCAL compared to algorithms from the literature.},

	among other approaches probabilistic and possibilistic logic can
	be considered as logics with additional restrictions in the general

	ingredient of the emerging multidisciplinary area of intelligent
	systems. In this area, intelligent systems are defined as human-made
	systems that are capable of achieving highly complex tasks in human-like,
	intelligent way. The qualifier "human-like" in this definition is
	important since it distinguishes the area of intelligent systems
	from the current mainstream of artificial intelligence. In the area
	of intelligent systems, the human mind is viewed as a role model
	and the aim is to understand and emulate its various cognitive capabilities.
	One of them is the remarkable capability of human beings to act on
	perceptions, with all the imprecision and uncertainty attached to
	them, and to approximate perceptions in natural language. In order
	to emulate this capability, we need to develop much deeper understanding
	of the many facets of uncertainty than we possess at this time.},
