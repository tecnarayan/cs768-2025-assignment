We study the problem of designing models for machine learning tasks defined
on \emph{sets}. In contrast to traditional approach of operating on fixed
dimensional vectors, we consider objective functions defined on sets that are
invariant to permutations. Such problems are widespread, ranging from
estimation of population statistics \cite{poczos13aistats}, to anomaly
detection in piezometer data of embankment dams \cite{Jung15Exploration}, to
cosmology \cite{Ntampaka16Dynamical,Ravanbakhsh16ICML1}. Our main theorem
characterizes the permutation invariant functions and provides a family of
functions to which any permutation invariant objective function must belong.
This family of functions has a special structure which enables us to design a
deep network architecture that can operate on sets and which can be deployed on
a variety of scenarios including both unsupervised and supervised learning
tasks. We also derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for permutation
equivariance in deep models. We demonstrate the applicability of our method on
population statistic estimation, point cloud classification, set expansion, and
outlier detection.
