abstract = "Given a collection of n functions defined on Rd, and a polyhedral set Q⊂Rd, we consider the problem of minimizing the sum of the k largest functions of the collection over Q. Specifically we focus on collections of linear functions and several classes of convex, piecewise linear functions which are defined by location models. We present simple linear programming formulations for these optimization models which give rise to linear time algorithms when the dimension d is fixed. Our results improve complexity bounds of several problems reported recently by Tamir [Discrete Appl. Math. 109 (2001) 293–307], Tokuyama [Proc. 33rd Annual ACM Symp. on Theory of Computing, 2001, pp. 75–84] and Kalcsics, Nickel, Puerto and Tamir [Oper. Res. Lett. 31 (1984) 114–127]."

abstract="Deep residual networks have emerged as a family of extremely deep architectures showing compelling accuracy and nice convergence behaviors. In this paper, we analyze the propagation formulations behind the residual building blocks, which suggest that the forward and backward signals can be directly propagated from one block to any other block, when using identity mappings as the skip connections and after-addition activation. A series of ablation experiments support the importance of these identity mappings. This motivates us to propose a new residual unit, which makes training easier and improves generalization. We report improved results using a 1001-layer ResNet on CIFAR-10 (4.62 {\%} error) and CIFAR-100, and a 200-layer ResNet on ImageNet.
