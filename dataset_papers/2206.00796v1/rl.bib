	abstract = {We prove performance guarantees of two algorithms for approximating Q* in batch reinforcement learning. Compared to classical iterative methods such as Fitted Q-Iteration---whose performance loss incurs quadratic dependence on horizon---these methods estimate (some forms of) the Bellman error and enjoy linear-in-horizon error propagation, a property established for the first time for algorithms that rely solely on batch data and output stationary policies. One of the algorithms uses a novel and explicit importance-weighting correction to overcome the infamous "double sampling" difficulty in Bellman error estimation, and does not use any squared losses. Our analyses reveal its distinct characteristics and potential advantages compared to classical algorithms. },

Under certain identifiability assumptions, we demonstrate how to estimate a mapping from the observations to latent states inductively through a sequence of regression and clustering steps---where previously decoded latent states provide labels for later regression problems---and use it to construct good exploration policies. We provide finite-sample guarantees on the quality of the learned state decoding function and exploration policies, and complement our theory with an empirical evaluation on a class of hard exploration problems. Our method exponentially improves over $Q$-learning with na{\"\i}ve exploration, even when $Q$-learning has cheating access to latent states.},

	abstract = {Strong worst-case performance bounds for episodic reinforcement learning exist but fortunately in practice RL algorithms perform much better than such bounds would predict. Algorithms and theory that provide strong problem-dependent bounds could help illuminate the key features of what makes a RL problem hard and reduce the barrier to using RL algorithms in practice. As a step towards this we derive an algorithm and analysis for finite horizon discrete MDPs with state-of-the-art worst-case regret bounds and substantially tighter bounds if the RL environment has special features but without apriori knowledge of the environment from the algorithm. As a result of our analysis, we also help address an open learning theory question \cite{jiang2018open} about episodic MDPs with a constant upper-bound on the sum of rewards, providing a regret bound function of the number of episodes with no dependence on the horizon.},

	abstract = {This paper gives specific divergence examples of value-iteration for several major Reinforcement Learning and Adaptive Dynamic Programming algorithms, when using a function approximator for the value function. These divergence examples differ from previous divergence examples in the literature, in that they are applicable for a greedy policy, i.e. in a ?value iteration? scenario. Perhaps surprisingly, with a greedy policy, it is also possible to get divergence for the algorithms TD(1) and Sarsa(1). In addition to these divergences, we also achieve divergence for the Adaptive Dynamic Programming algorithms HDP, DHP and GDHP.},

	abstract = {This paper studies systematic exploration for reinforcement learning (RL) with rich observations and function approximation. We introduce contextual decision processes (CDPs), that unify most prior RL settings. Our first contribution is a complexity measure, the Bellman rank, that we show enables tractable learning of near-optimal behavior in CDPs and is naturally small for many well-studied RL models. Our second contribution is a new RL algorithm that does systematic exploration to learn near-optimal behavior in CDPs with low Bellman rank. The algorithm requires a number of samples that is polynomial in all relevant parameters but independent of the number of unique contexts. Our approach uses Bellman error minimization with optimistic exploration and provides new insights into efficient exploration for RL with function approximation.},

Specifically, SAO combines the \emphO(√\emphn) worst-case regret of Exp3 (Auer et al., 2002b) and the (poly)logarithmic regret of UCB1 (Auer et al., 2002a) for stochastic rewards. Adversarial rewards and stochastic rewards are the two main settings in the literature on multi-armed bandits (MAB). Prior work on MAB treats them separately, and does not attempt to jointly optimize for both. This result falls into the general agenda to design algorithms that combine the optimal worst-case performance with improved guarantees for ``nice'' problem instances.},

@article{Azar2013_journal,
	abstract = {We consider the problems of learning the optimal action-value function and the optimal policy in discounted-reward Markov decision processes (MDPs). We prove new PAC bounds on the sample-complexity of two well-known model-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in the presence of a generative model of the MDP: value iteration and policy iteration. The first result indicates that for an MDP with N state-action pairs and the discount factor $\gamma$∈[0,1) only O(Nlog(N/$\delta$)/((1−$\gamma$)3$\epsilon$2)) state-transition samples are required to find an $\epsilon$-optimal estimation of the action-value function with the probability (w.p.) 1−$\delta$. Further, we prove that, for small values of $\epsilon$, an order of O(Nlog(N/$\delta$)/((1−$\gamma$)3$\epsilon$2)) samples is required to find an $\epsilon$-optimal policy w.p. 1−$\delta$. We also prove a matching lower bound of $\Theta$(Nlog(N/$\delta$)/((1−$\gamma$)3$\epsilon$2)) on the sample complexity of estimating the optimal action-value function with $\epsilon$ accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first minimax result on the sample complexity of RL: the upper bounds match the lower bound in terms of N, $\epsilon$, $\delta$ and 1/(1−$\gamma$) up to a constant factor. Also, both our lower bound and upper bound improve on the state-of-the-art in terms of their dependence on 1/(1−$\gamma$).},
