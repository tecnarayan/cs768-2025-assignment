author = {Ellen M Markman and Gwyn F Wachtel},
abstract = {For children to acquire vocabulary as rapidly as they do, they must be able to eliminate many potential meanings of words. One way children may do this is to assume category terms are mutually exclusive. Thus, if a child already knows a label for an object, a new label for that object should be rejected. Six studies with 3-year-olds tested this hypothesis. Study 1 demonstrated that children reject a second label for an object, treating it, instead, as a label for a novel object. In the remaining studies, this simple novel label-novel object strategy was precluded. If the only object present is familiar, children cannot map a novel term to a novel object. Instead they must analyze the object for some other attribute to label. In Studies 2–6, children were taught either a new part term, e.g., trachea, or a new substance term, e.g., pewter, by showing them an object and saying, “This is a trachea” or (“It is pewter”). For unfamiliar objects, children tended to interpret the term as a label for the object itself. For familiar objects, they tended instead to interpret it as a part or substance term. Thus, mutual exclusivity motivates children to learn terms for attributes, substances, and parts as well as for objects themselves.}

abstract = {In various cultures and at all spatial scales, humans produce a rich complexity of geometric shapes such as lines, circles or spirals. Here, we propose that humans possess a language of thought for geometric shapes that can produce line drawings as recursive combinations of a minimal set of geometric primitives. We present a programming language, similar to Logo, that combines discrete numbers and continuous integration to form higher-level structures based on repetition, concatenation and embedding, and we show that the simplest programs in this language generate the fundamental geometric shapes observed in human cultures. On the perceptual side, we propose that shape perception in humans involves searching for the shortest program that correctly draws the image (program induction). A consequence of this framework is that the mental difficulty of remembering a shape should depend on its minimum description length (MDL) in the proposed language. In two experiments, we show that encoding and processing of geometric shapes is well predicted by MDL. Furthermore, our hypotheses predict additive laws for the psychological complexity of repeated, concatenated or embedded shapes, which we confirm experimentally.}

abstract = {Library learning compresses a given corpus of programs by extracting common structure from the corpus into reusable library functions. Prior work on library learning suffers from two limitations that prevent it from scaling to larger, more complex inputs. First, it explores too many candidate library functions that are not useful for compression. Second, it is not robust to syntactic variation in the input. We propose library learning modulo theory (LLMT), a new library learning algorithm that additionally takes as input an equational theory for a given problem domain. LLMT uses e-graphs and equality saturation to compactly represent the space of programs equivalent modulo the theory, and uses a novel e-graph anti-unification technique to find common patterns in the corpus more directly and efficiently. We implemented LLMT in a tool named babble. Our evaluation shows that babble achieves better compression orders of magnitude faster than the state of the art. We also provide a qualitative evaluation showing that babble learns reusable functions on inputs previously out of reach for library learning.},

abstract = {This paper introduces corpus-guided top-down synthesis as a mechanism for synthesizing library functions that capture common functionality from a corpus of programs in a domain specific language (DSL). The algorithm builds abstractions directly from initial DSL primitives, using syntactic pattern matching of intermediate abstractions to intelligently prune the search space and guide the algorithm towards abstractions that maximally capture shared structures in the corpus. We present an implementation of the approach in a tool called Stitch and evaluate it against the state-of-the-art deductive library learning algorithm from DreamCoder. Our evaluation shows that Stitch is 3-4 orders of magnitude faster and uses 2 orders of magnitude less memory while maintaining comparable or better library quality (as measured by compressivity). We also demonstrate Stitch’s scalability on corpora containing hundreds of complex programs that are intractable with prior deductive approaches and show empirically that it is robust to terminating the search procedure early—further allowing it to scale to challenging datasets by means of early stopping.},

abstract = {We present a system for inductive program synthesis called DreamCoder, which inputs a corpus of synthesis problems each specified by one or a few examples, and automatically derives a library of program components and a neural search policy that can be used to efficiently solve other similar synthesis problems. The library and search policy bootstrap each other iteratively through a variant of "wake-sleep" approximate Bayesian learning. A new refactoring algorithm based on E-graph matching identifies common sub-components across synthesized programs, building a progressively deepening library of abstractions capturing the structure of the input domain. We evaluate on eight domains including classic program synthesis areas and AI tasks such as planning, inverse graphics, and equation discovery. We show that jointly learning the library and neural search policy leads to solving more problems, and solving them more quickly.},

	Abstract = {Deep belief networks are a powerful way to model complex probability distributions. However, learning the structure of a belief network, particularly one with hidden units, is difficult. The Indian buffet process has been used as a nonparametric Bayesian prior on the directed structure of a belief network with a single infinitely wide hidden layer. In this paper, we introduce the cascading Indian buffet process (CIBP), which provides a nonparametric prior on the structure of a layered, directed belief network that is unbounded in both depth and width, yet allows tractable inference. We use the CIBP prior with the nonlinear Gaussian belief network so each unit can additionally vary its behavior between discrete and continuous representations. We provide Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for inference in these belief networks and explore the structures learned on several image data sets.},

abstract = {Learning complex symbolic concepts requires a rich hypothesis space, but exploring such spaces is intractable. We describe how sampling algorithms can be brought to bear on this problem, leading to the prediction that humans will exhibit the same failure modes as sampling algorithms. In particular, we show that humans get stuck in “garden paths”—initially promising hypotheses that turn out to be sub-optimal in light of subsequent data. Susceptibility to garden paths is sensitive to the availability of cognitive resources. These phenomena are well-explained by a Bayesian model in which humans stochastically update a sample-based representation of the posterior over a compositional hypothesis space. Our model provides a framework for understanding “bounded rationality” in symbolic concept learning.}

	abstract = {Given a CNF formula and a weight for each assignment of values tovariables, two natural problems are weighted model counting anddistribution-aware sampling of satisfying assignments.  Both problems have a wide variety of important applications.  Due to the inherentcomplexity of the exact versions of the problems, interest has focusedon solving them approximately.  Prior work in this area scaled only tosmall problems in practice, or failed to provide strong theoreticalguarantees, or employed a computationally-expensive most-probable-explanation ({\MPE}) queries that assumes prior knowledge of afactored representation of the weight distribution. We identify a novel parameter,\emph{tilt}, which is the ratio of the maximum weight of satisfying assignment to minimum weightof satisfying assignment and present anovel approach that works with a black-box oracle for weights ofassignments and requires only an {\NP}-oracle (in practice, a {\SAT}-solver) to solve both thecounting and sampling problems when the tilt is small.  Our approach  provides strong theoretical guarantees, and scales toproblems involving several thousand variables. We also show that theassumption of small tilt can be significantly relaxed while improving computational efficiency if a factored representation of the weights is known.},

	year = {2015},
	month = {12/2015},
	abstract = {<p>Many AI problems, such as planning, grammar learning, program induction, and theory discovery, require searching in symbolic domains. Most models perform this search by evaluating a sequence of candidate solutions, generated in order by some heuristic. Human reasoning, though, is not limited to sequential trial and error.\&nbsp; In particular, humans are able to reason <em>about </em>what the solution to a particular problem should look like, before comparing candidates against the data. In a program synthesis task, for instance, a human might first determine that the task at hand should be solved by a tail-recursive algorithm, before filling in the\&nbsp; algorithm{\textquoteright}s details.</p>

<p>Reasoning in this way about solution structure confers at least two computational advantages. First, a given structure subsumes a potentially large collection of primitive solutions, and exploiting the constraints present in the structure{\textquoteright}s definition makes it possible to eval- uate the collection in substantially less time than it would take to evaluate each in turn. For example, a programmer might quickly conclude that a given algorithm cannot be implemented without recursion, without having to consider all possible non-recursive solutions. Second, it is often possible to estimate ahead of time the cost of evaluating different structures, making it possible to prioritize those that can be treated cheaply. In planning a route through an unfamiliar city, for example, one might first consider possibilities which use the subway exclusively, excluding for the moment ones that involve bus trips as well: if a successfully subway-only solution can be found, one then avoids the (potentially) exponentially more difficult bus-and-subway search problem.</p>

<p>Here, we consider a family of toy problems [1], in which an agent is given a balance scale, and is required to find a lighter counterfeit coin in a collection of genuine coins using at most some prescribed number of weighings. We develop a language for expressing solution structure\&nbsp; that places restrictions on a set of <em>programs</em>,\&nbsp; and use recent program synthesis techniques to search for a solution, encoded as a program, subject to hypothesized constraints on the program \&nbsp;structure.</p>

    abstract = "We present the first comprehensive study on automatic knowledge base construction for two prevalent commonsense knowledge graphs: ATOMIC (Sap et al., 2019) and ConceptNet (Speer et al., 2017). Contrary to many conventional KBs that store knowledge with canonical templates, commonsense KBs only store loosely structured open-text descriptions of knowledge. We posit that an important step toward automatic commonsense completion is the development of generative models of commonsense knowledge, and propose COMmonsEnse Transformers (COMET) that learn to generate rich and diverse commonsense descriptions in natural language. Despite the challenges of commonsense modeling, our investigation reveals promising results when implicit knowledge from deep pre-trained language models is transferred to generate explicit knowledge in commonsense knowledge graphs. Empirical results demonstrate that COMET is able to generate novel knowledge that humans rate as high quality, with up to 77.5{\%} (ATOMIC) and 91.7{\%} (ConceptNet) precision at top 1, which approaches human performance for these resources. Our findings suggest that using generative commonsense models for automatic commonsense KB completion could soon be a plausible alternative to extractive methods.",

    abstract = "While large pre-trained language models are powerful, their predictions often lack logical consistency across test inputs. For example, a state-of-the-art Macaw question-answering (QA) model answers {\textless}i{\textgreater}Yes{\textless}/i{\textgreater} to {\textless}i{\textgreater}Is a sparrow a bird?{\textless}/i{\textgreater} and {\textless}i{\textgreater}Does a bird have feet?{\textless}/i{\textgreater} but answers {\textless}i{\textgreater}No{\textless}/i{\textgreater} to {\textless}i{\textgreater}Does a sparrow have feet?{\textless}/i{\textgreater}. To address this failure mode, we propose a framework, Consistency Correction through Relation Detection, or {\textless}b{\textgreater}ConCoRD{\textless}/b{\textgreater}, for boosting the consistency and accuracy of pre-trained NLP models using pre-trained natural language inference (NLI) models without fine-tuning or re-training. Given a batch of test inputs, ConCoRD samples several candidate outputs for each input and instantiates a factor graph that accounts for both the model{'}s belief about the likelihood of each answer choice in isolation and the NLI model{'}s beliefs about pair-wise answer choice compatibility. We show that a weighted MaxSAT solver can efficiently compute high-quality answer choices under this factor graph, improving over the raw model{'}s predictions. Our experiments demonstrate that ConCoRD consistently boosts accuracy and consistency of off-the-shelf closed-book QA and VQA models using off-the-shelf NLI models, notably increasing accuracy of LXMERT on ConVQA by 5{\%} absolute. See the project website (https://ericmitchell.ai/emnlp-2022-concord/) for code and data.",

However, these approaches are fundamentally bounded by the correctness of explanations, which themselves are often noisy and inconsistent. In this work, we develop Maieutic Prompting, which aims to infer a correct answer to a question even from the unreliable generations of LM. Maieutic Prompting induces a tree of explanations abductively (e.g. X is true, because ...) and recursively, then frames the inference as a satisfiability problem over these explanations and their logical relations. We test Maieutic Prompting for true/false QA on three challenging benchmarks that require complex commonsense reasoning. Maieutic Prompting achieves up to 20{\%} better accuracy than state-of-the-art prompting methods, and as a fully unsupervised approach, performs competitively with supervised models. We also show that Maieutic Prompting improves robustness in inference while providing interpretable rationales.",

abstract = {Abstract Marr's levels of analysis—computational, algorithmic, and implementation—have served cognitive science well over the last 30 years. But the recent increase in the popularity of the computational level raises a new challenge: How do we begin to relate models at different levels of analysis? We propose that it is possible to define levels of analysis that lie between the computational and the algorithmic, providing a way to build a bridge between computational- and algorithmic-level models. The key idea is to push the notion of rationality, often used in defining computational-level models, deeper toward the algorithmic level. We offer a simple recipe for reverse-engineering the mind's cognitive strategies by deriving optimal algorithms for a series of increasingly more realistic abstract computational architectures, which we call “resource-rational analysis.”},

Here we looked at whether preschoolers (mean: 54months) recognize “action possibilities” (affordances) in the environment that allow them to isolate variables when there is information to be gained. By manipulating the physical properties of the stimuli, we were able to affect the degree to which candidate variables could be isolated; by manipulating the base rate of candidate causes, we were able to affect the potential for information gain. Children’s exploratory play was sensitive to both manipulations: given unambiguous evidence children played indiscriminately and rarely tried to isolate candidate causes; given ambiguous evidence, children both selected (Experiment 1) and designed (Experiment 2) informative interventions.}
