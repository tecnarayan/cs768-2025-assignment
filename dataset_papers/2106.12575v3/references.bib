  abstract = 	 {This work generalizes graph neural networks (GNNs) beyond those based on the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) algorithm, graph Laplacians, and diffusions. Our approach, denoted Relational Pooling (RP), draws from the theory of finite partial exchangeability to provide a framework with maximal representation power for graphs. RP can work with existing graph representation models and, somewhat counterintuitively, can make them even more powerful than the original WL isomorphism test. Additionally, RP allows architectures like Recurrent Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks to be used in a theoretically sound approach for graph classification. We demonstrate improved performance of RP-based graph representations over state-of-the-art methods on a number of tasks.}

abstract = { We show that the Graph Isomorphism (GI) problem and the more general problems of String Isomorphism (SI) andCoset Intersection (CI) can be solved in quasipolynomial(exp((logn)O(1))) time. The best previous bound for GI was exp(O( √n log n)), where n is the number of vertices (Luks, 1983); for the other two problems, the bound was similar, exp(O~(√ n)), where n is the size of the permutation domain (Babai, 1983). Following the approach of Luks’s seminal 1980/82 paper, the problem we actually address is SI. This problem takes two strings of length n and a permutation group G of degree n (the “ambient group”) as input (G is given by a list of generators) and asks whether or not one of the strings can be transformed into the other by some element of G. Luks’s divide-and-conquer algorithm for SI proceeds by recursion on the ambient group. We build on Luks’s framework and attack the obstructions to efficient Luks recurrence via an interplay between local and global symmetry. We construct group theoretic “local certificates” to certify the presence or absence of local symmetry, aggregate the negative certificates to canonical k-ary relations where k = O(log n), and employ combinatorial canonical partitioning techniques to split the k-ary relational structure for efficient divide-and- conquer. We show that in a well–defined sense, Johnson graphs are the only obstructions to effective canonical partitioning. The central element of the algorithm is the “local certificates” routine which is based on a new group theoretic result, the “Unaffected stabilizers lemma,” that allows us to construct global automorphisms out of local information. },

Besides theoretical development, this paper introduces effective mathematical tools in terms of certain data-dependent orthogonal systems for function representation and analysis directly on the digraphs. In addition, this paper also includes algorithmic development and discussion of various experimental results on such data-sets as CORA, Proposition, and Wiki-votes."

Here we provide a detailed survey of proposed main-memory solutions to these problems, in a unified way. We note that previous authors have paid surprisingly little attention to space complexity of main-memory solutions, despite its both fundamental and practical interest. We therefore detail space complexities of known algorithms and discuss their implications. We also present new algorithms which are time optimal for triangle listing and beats previous algorithms concerning space needs. They have the additional advantage of performing better on power-law graphs, which we also detail. We finally show with an experimental study that these two algorithms perform very well in practice, allowing us to handle cases which were previously out of reach."

All the maximal cliques generated are output in a tree-like form. Subsequently, we prove that its worst-case time complexity is O(3n/3) for an n-vertex graph. This is optimal as a function of n, since there exist up to 3n/3 maximal cliques in an n-vertex graph. The algorithm is also demonstrated to run very fast in practice by computational experiments.}

This note bridges the gap between three papers addressing this problem: the original paper of Bron–Kerbosh [C. Bron, J. Kerbosch, Algorithm 457: Finding all cliques of an undirected graph, Communication of ACM 16 (9) (1973) 575–577], and two papers recently published in TCS, namely that of Tomita et al. [Tomita, A.

Koch, Fundamental study: Enumerating all connected maximal common subgraphs in two graphs, Theoretical Computer Science 250 (1–2) (2001) 1–30]. In particular, we show that the strategy of Tomita et al. is a simple modification of the Bron–Kerbosch algorithm, based on an (un-exploited) observation raised in Koch’s paper.}
