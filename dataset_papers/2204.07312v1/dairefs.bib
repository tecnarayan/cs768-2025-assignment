% I think it is a good idea to maintain a master reference file for
% latex so that we can avoid retyping, and also look for appropriate
% references on a per topic basis.
%
% The bibtex master file is in ~sandholm/refs/dairefs.bib at this point.
% I have given everybody the access rights for reading and writing.
%
% To make this work, everyone has to be very careful when adding into
% the file.  Here are a couple of conventions that I have found useful,
% and I suggest that we use them in the future also.  They are of course
% open to discussion (but not open to undiscussed deviation).  :-)
%
% 1. Standard bibtex issues are followed, e.g. different keywords for
% books, proceedings, theses, tech reports, collection, journals etc.
%
% 2. The database is divided into sections, separated by section
% headers.  The first two sections were copied from other dai databases,
% but I generated the rest.  The sections correspond to topics,
% e.g. scheduling.  The references should be added in the appropriate
% section.  Nothing should be added into sections 1 and 2.
%
% 3. The references are alphabetically ordered in each section
% (according to the first author's last name).
%
% 4. The reference names are: first-author's-last-name + year +
% first-word-of-title.  E.g. Sandholm96:Leveled.  (This convention is
% not followed in sections 1 and 2, because they were generated by other
% people).
%
% 5.  A number of shorthand notations have been defined in the beginning
% of the file.  When they exist, they should be used to allow uniformity
% of how references look.  Feel free to add new shorthands.
%
%
% I have found that this saves a lot of time compared to the other latex
% referencing method.
%
% Let me know what you think.
%
% Best,

closely related to the coordinated attack problem. Two players have to
play one of two possible coordination games. Only one of them receives
information about the coordination game to be played. It is shown that
even if a large (but finite) number of propositions of the type 'i
knows that j knows that i knows... that the game is G' are true, the
game theoretic situation is very different from when the coordination
game played is common knowledge. The example emphasizes the importance
of the common knowledge assumption in game theory.",

  comment = "We know that consumers like the convenience-in fact, 48
percent said that was the main reason they shop online, said Susan
Grant, NCL Vice President for Public Policy and Director of its
Internet Fraud Watch program. The survey, conducted by Opinion
Research Corporation International, also showed that most consumers
are happy with their e-commerce experiences. One in five reported
problems with online purchases.  The most common problems were:
products or services that were misrepresented (8 percent); products or
services that were paid for, but never received (6 percent); charges
that were billed, but never authorized (3 percent); charges that were
more than the agreed price (1 percent).  Despite the fact that most
consumers said they prefer to pay for online orders with credit cards
(67 percent) and that few reported any problems in that regard, the
most common concern (41 percent) was that their credit card numbers
would be stolen if they gave them online. What is even more
distressing is that 69 percent of consumers incorrectly believe that
it is safer to pay for an online purchase by check or money order
rather than credit card, observed Grant. People don't realize that
encryption is commonly used to protect financial information during
transmission. And that federal law protects credit cards users if they
don't get what they were promised or unauthorized charges were made to
their accounts.",

A buyer's valuation for the good as well as her budget are her private information. We derive constrained-efficient and revenue maximizing auctions for this setting. In general, the optimal auction requires `pooling' both at the top and in the middle despite the maintained assumption of a mono- tone hazard rate. Further, the auctioneer will never find it desirable to subsidize bidders with low budgets.},

These methods can extend our knowledge and provide new tools for enhancing health and wellbeing. However, they raise questions about how to best address potential threats to privacy while reaping benefits for individuals and to society as a whole. The use of machine learning to make leaps across informational and social contexts to infer health conditions and risks from nonmedical data provides representative scenarios for reflections on directions with balancing innovation and regulation.},

  comment = {Baliga and Vohra study the design of profit-maximizing auctions when the valuation distribution is unknown to the agents involved. They study both monopoly pricing, where there is a single seller selling multiple units of a single item and there are multiple unit-demand bidders. Each bidder's valuation is represented as an indepedent draw from a distribution F. Essentially, to price bidder i, the aution designer uses the bids of the other agents to estimate the demand of the other agents, and this empirical distribution is used to set bidder i's price. As the number of agents tends to infinity, the expected profit converges to the optimal profit achievable if the seller knew F. The authors also consider a scenario where there are multiple bidders and multiple sellers. Each seller can sell at most one unit he owns and each buyer wants at most one unit. The sellers' costs are independently drawn from a distribuiton H and the bidders' valuations are independents drawn from a distribution F. The authors propose a similar scheme where the demand and cost distributions are estimated from the buyers' and sellers' reports and the trades and payments are calculated according to these emprical distributions. The marketplace of buyers and sellers is split into two sets: A and B. The reports from group A are used to estimate the demand and costs of group B, and vice versa. Therefore, the auction remains incentive compatible and individually rational.},

Each bidder's valuation is an independent draw from a distribution F. He begins by presenting the optimal auction when F is known. Next, he considers the same problem when F is unknown, but the seller is endowed with a Bayseian prior over possible distributions. In order to price Bidder i, given the bids of all other bidders, the sellers chooses the optimal price based on the posterior distribution. In this way, Bidder i's price does not depend on his bid, so the auction remains incentive compatible. Segal proves that as the number of bidders tends to infinity, the seller's expected profit converges to the maximum profit achievable with the knowledge of the true distribution F.},
