	Abstract = {An algebraic decay rate is derived which bounds the time required for velocities to equilibrate in a spatially homogeneous flow-through model representing the continuum limit of a gas of particles interacting through slightly inelastic collisions. This rate is obtained by reformulating the dynamical problem as the gradient flow of a convex energy on an infinite-dimensional manifold. An abstract theory is developed for gradient flows in length spaces, which shows how degenerate convexity (or even non-convexity) --- if uniformly controlled --- will quantify contractivity (limit expansivity) of the flow.},

@article{Sirignano:2018,
	Abstract = {Machine learning, and in particular neural network models, have revolutionized fields such as image, text, and speech recognition. Today, many important real-world applications in these areas are driven by neural networks. There are also growing applications in engineering, robotics, medicine, and finance. Despite their immense success in practice, there is limited mathematical understanding of neural networks. This paper illustrates how neural networks can be studied via stochastic analysis, and develops approaches for addressing some of the technical challenges which arise. We analyze one-layer neural networks in the asymptotic regime of simultaneously (A) large network sizes and (B) large numbers of stochastic gradient descent training iterations. We rigorously prove that the empirical distribution of the neural network parameters converges to the solution of a nonlinear partial differential equation. This result can be considered a law of large numbers for neural networks. In addition, a consequence of our analysis is that the trained parameters of the neural network asymptotically become independent, a property which is commonly called "propagation of chaos".},

@article{Dziugaite:2015a,
	Abstract = {We consider training a deep neural network to generate samples from an unknown distribution given i.i.d. data. We frame learning as an optimization minimizing a two-sample test statistic---informally speaking, a good generator network produces samples that cause a two-sample test to fail to reject the null hypothesis. As our two-sample test statistic, we use an unbiased estimate of the maximum mean discrepancy, which is the centerpiece of the nonparametric kernel two-sample test proposed by Gretton et al. (2012). We compare to the adversarial nets framework introduced by Goodfellow et al. (2014), in which learning is a two-player game between a generator network and an adversarial discriminator network, both trained to outwit the other. From this perspective, the MMD statistic plays the role of the discriminator. In addition to empirical comparisons, we prove bounds on the generalization error incurred by optimizing the empirical MMD.},

@article{Li:2017a,
	Abstract = {Generative moment matching network (GMMN) is a deep generative model that differs from Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) by replacing the discriminator in GAN with a two-sample test based on kernel maximum mean discrepancy (MMD). Although some theoretical guarantees of MMD have been studied, the empirical performance of GMMN is still not as competitive as that of GAN on challenging and large benchmark datasets. The computational efficiency of GMMN is also less desirable in comparison with GAN, partially due to its requirement for a rather large batch size during the training. In this paper, we propose to improve both the model expressiveness of GMMN and its computational efficiency by introducing adversarial kernel learning techniques, as the replacement of a fixed Gaussian kernel in the original GMMN. The new approach combines the key ideas in both GMMN and GAN, hence we name it MMD GAN. The new distance measure in MMD GAN is a meaningful loss that enjoys the advantage of weak topology and can be optimized via gradient descent with relatively small batch sizes. In our evaluation on multiple benchmark datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR- 10, CelebA and LSUN, the performance of MMD-GAN significantly outperforms GMMN, and is competitive with other representative GAN works.},

The algorithm is derived from a theory in nonconvex optimization related to the diffusion equation. The contributions made in this work are two fold. First, we show how some seemingly disconnected mechanisms used in deep learning such as smart initialization, annealed learning rate, layerwise pretraining, and noise injection (as done in dropout and SGD) arise naturally and automatically from this framework, without manually crafting them into the algorithms. Second, we present some preliminary results on comparing the proposed method against SGD. It turns out that the new algorithm can achieve similar level of generalization accuracy of SGD in much fewer number of epochs.},

	Abstract = {Let \$G\$ be a compact subgroup of \$GL\_n({\textbackslash}R)\$ acting linearly on a finite dimensional vector space \$E\$. B. Malgrange has shown that the space \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{C\}{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}infty({\textbackslash}R{\textasciicircum}n,E){\textasciicircum}G\$ of \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{C\}{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}infty\$ and \$G\$-covariant functions is a finite module over the ring \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{C\}{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}infty({\textbackslash}R{\textasciicircum}n){\textasciicircum}G\$ of \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{C\}{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}infty\$ and \$G\$-invariant functions. First, we generalize this result for the Schwartz space \${\textbackslash}mathscr\{S\}({\textbackslash}R{\textasciicircum}n,E){\textasciicircum}G\$ of \$G\$-covariant functions. Secondly, we prove that any \$G\$-covariant distribution can be decomposed into a sum of \$G\$-invariant distributions multiplied with a fixed family of \$G\$-covariant polynomials. This gives a generalization of an Oksak result proved in ([O]).},
