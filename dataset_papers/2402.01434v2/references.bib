It is possible to make sense of conditioning this process to be in the state 0 at an independent exponential random time and if we kill the conditioned process at the exponential time the resulting process is Markov. If we let the rate parameter of the random time go to 0, then the limit of the killed Markov process evolves like X conditioned to hit 0, after which time it behaves as X killed at the last time X visits 0. Equivalently, the limit process has the dynamics of the killed “bang–bang” Brownian motion that evolves like Brownian motion with positive drift +μ when it is negative, like Brownian motion with negative drift −μ when it is positive, and is killed according to the local time spent at 0., An extension of this result holds in great generality for a Borel right process conditioned to be in some state a at an exponential random time, at which time it is killed. Our proofs involve understanding the Campbell measures associated with local times, the use of excursion theory, and the development of a suitable analogue of the “bang–bang” construction for a general Markov process., As examples, we consider the special case when the transient Borel right process is a one-dimensional diffusion. Characterizing the limiting conditioned and killed process via its infinitesimal generator leads to an investigation of the h-transforms of transient one-dimensional diffusion processes that goes beyond what is known and is of independent interest.},

	abstract = {Diffusion probabilistic models have quickly become a major approach for generative modeling of images, 3D geometry, video and other domains. However, to adapt diffusion generative modeling to these domains the denoising network needs to be carefully designed for each domain independently, oftentimes under the assumption that data lives in a Euclidean grid. In this paper we introduce Diffusion Probabilistic Fields (DPF), a diffusion model that can learn distributions over continuous functions defined over metric spaces, commonly known as fields. We extend the formulation of diffusion probabilistic models to deal with this field parametrization in an explicit way, enabling us to define an end-to-end learning algorithm that side-steps the requirement of representing fields with latent vectors as in previous approaches (Dupont et al., 2022a; Du et al., 2021). We empirically show that, while using the same denoising network, DPF effectively deals with different modalities like 2D images and 3D geometry, in addition to modeling distributions over fields defined on non-Euclidean metric spaces.},

Our approach works by first defining a path of probability measures that interpolates between a fixed Gaussian measure and the data distribution, followed by learning a vector field on the underlying space of functions that generates this path of measures. Our method does not rely on likelihoods or simulations, making it well-suited to the function space setting. We provide both a theoretical framework for building such models and an empirical evaluation of our techniques. We demonstrate through experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks that our proposed FFM method outperforms several recently proposed function-space generative models.},

The SPDEs are considered in the form of mild solutions in an abstract Hilbert space framework suitable for parabolic equations. They are assumed to be linear with additive noise in the form of a cylindrical Wiener process. The observational noise is also cylindrical and SPDE bridges are formulated via conditional distributions of Gaussian random variables in Hilbert spaces. A general framework for the spatial discretization of these bridge processes is introduced. Explicit convergence rates are derived for a spectral and a finite element based method. It is shown that for sufficiently rough observation noise, the rates are essentially the same as those of the corresponding discretization of the original SPDE.},

This approach allows for a full characterization of all possible solutions, and their relative probabilities, whilst simultaneously forcing significant modelling issues to be addressed in a clear and precise fashion. Although expensive to implement, this approach is starting to lie within the range of the available computational resources in many application areas. It also allows for the quantification of uncertainty and risk, something which is increasingly demanded by these applications. Furthermore, the approach is conceptually important for the understanding of simpler, computationally expedient approaches to inverse problems.},

	abstract = {Gaussian processes appear as building blocks in various stochastic models and have been found instrumental to account for imprecisely known, latent functions. It is often the case that such functions may be directly or indirectly evaluated, be it in static or in sequential settings. Here we focus on situations where, rather than pointwise evaluations, evaluations of prescribed linear operators at the function of interest are (sequentially) assimilated. While working with operator data is increasingly encountered in the practice of Gaussian process modelling, mathematical details of conditioning and model updating in such settings are typically by-passed. Here we address these questions by highlighting conditions under which Gaussian process modelling coincides with endowing separable Banach spaces of functions with Gaussian measures, and by leveraging existing results on the disintegration of such measures with respect to operator data. Using recent results on path properties of GPs and their connection to RKHS, we extend the Gaussian process - Gaussian measure correspondence beyond the standard setting of Gaussian random elements in the Banach space of continuous functions. Turning then to the sequential settings, we revisit update formulae in the Gaussian measure framework and establish equalities between ﬁnal and intermediate posterior mean functions and covariance operators. The latter equalities appear as inﬁnite-dimensional and discretization-independent analogues of Gaussian vector update formulae.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.05394},
	abstract = {The Mat\{{\textbackslash}'e\}rn family of isotropic covariance functions has been central to the theoretical development and application of statistical models for geospatial data. For global data defined over the whole sphere representing planet Earth, the natural distance between any two locations is the great circle distance. In this setting, the Mat\{{\textbackslash}'e\}rn family of covariance functions has a restriction on the smoothness parameter, making it an unappealing choice to model smooth data. Finding a suitable analogue for modelling data on the sphere is still an open problem. This paper proposes a new family of isotropic covariance functions for random fields defined over the sphere. The proposed family has a parameter that indexes the mean square differentiability of the corresponding Gaussian field, and allows for any admissible range of fractal dimension. Our simulation study mimics the fixed domain asymptotic setting, which is the most natural regime for sampling on a closed and bounded set. As expected, our results support the analogous results (under the same asymptotic scheme) for planar processes that not all parameters can be estimated consistently. We apply the proposed model to a dataset of precipitable water content over a large portion of the Earth, and show that the model gives more precise predictions of the underlying process at unsampled locations than does the Mat\{{\textbackslash}'e\}rn model using chordal distances.},

Stochastic partial differential equations driven by white noise are used to describe continuous spatial temporal processes. The models considered here are based on the heat or diffusion equation in one or two spatial dimensions and time. Spectral density functions of these processes can be calculated and inverted using Fourier transforms to obtain the corresponding covariance functions. In two spatial dimensions, numerical integrations are necessary for calculating the correlation functions for these models since Hankel transforms without closed form solutions are involved. FORTRAN subroutines are available to calculate these Hankel transforms and covariance functions. Maximum likelihood estimation can be used assuming Gaussian errors. For small data sets (up to several hundred observations) exact maximum likelihood estimates can be calculated directly. For larger data sets, nearest neighbor methods can be used to reduce the computation and obtain approximate likelihoods. Two examples are discussed.},

This implies that any attempt to design geodesic Gaussian kernels on curved Riemannian manifolds is futile. However, we show that for spaces with conditionally negative deﬁnite distances the geodesic Laplacian kernel can be generalized while retaining positive deﬁniteness. This implies that geodesic Laplacian kernels can be generalized to some curved spaces, including spheres and hyperbolic spaces. Our theoretical results are veriﬁed empirically.},

Our asymptotic generator is a non linear diffusion generator with a killing rate governed by the GP order parameter. The associated stochastic process properly describes the single particle motion in the Bose–Einstein condensate including the self-interaction which acts here as a probability density-dependent killing rate. Finally, in a one-dimensional setting, we discuss under which conditions the process conditioned to survival converges to a quasi-stationary distribution having density with respect to the speed measure given by the principal eigenfunction of the diffusion generator with killing.},

In addition to the parameters of the spatial dependence (variance, smoothness, and practical correlation range) it additionally has parameters controlling the practical correlation range in time, the smoothness in time, and the type of non-separability of the spatio-temporal covariance. Through the separability parameter, the model also allows for separable covariance functions.

To illustrate its use, the momentum map theorem is shown to recover the known algorithms for matching landmarks, scalar images and vector ﬁelds. After brieﬂy discussing the use of this approach for Diﬀusion Tensor (DT) images, we explain how to use momentum maps in the design of registration algorithms for more general data structures. For example, we extend our methods to determine the corresponding momentum map for registration using semidirect product groups, for the purpose of matching images at two diﬀerent length scales. Finally, we discuss the use of momentum maps in the design of image registration algorithms when the image data is deﬁned on manifolds instead of vector spaces.},

The study of Stratonovich equations is largely motivated by the stochastic variational principle of SALT [Holm,2015] for fluid dynamics, and we discuss an application of the framework to a Navier-Stokes Equation with Stochastic Lie Transport as seen in [Goodair,2022]. Moreover we prove a fundamental existence and uniqueness result (which to the best of our knowledge, is not present in the literature) for SPDEs evolving in a finite dimensional Hilbert Space driven by Cylindrical Brownian Motion, assuming the analogy to the Lipschitz and linear growth conditions for the standard existence and uniqueness theory for SDEs.},

The final sections are more demanding and assume familiarity with continuous-time stochastic processes constructed from their infinitesimal generator.

The simultaneous treatment of diffusion processes and jump processes in this book is unique: Each chapter starts from continuous processes and then proceeds to processes with jumps. In the first part of the book, it is shown that solutions of stochastic differential equations define stochastic flows of diffeomorphisms. Then, the relation between stochastic flows and heat equations is discussed. The latter part investigates fundamental solutions of these heat equations (heat kernels) through the study of the Malliavin calculus. The author obtains smooth densities for transition functions of various types of diffusions and jump-diffusions and shows that these density functions are fundamental solutions for various types of heat equations and backward heat equations. Thus, in this book fundamental solutions for heat equations and backward heat equations are constructed independently of the theory of partial differential equations.

We develop a spline interpolation method which is directly related to cubic splines on a Riemannian manifold. Our strategy consists of introducing a control variable on the Hamiltonian equations of the geodesies. Motivated by statistical modeling of spatiotemporal data, we also design a stochastic model to deal with random shape evolutions. This model is closely related to the spline model since the control variable previously introduced is set as a random force perturbing the evolution. Although we focus on the finite-dimensional case of landmarks, our models can be extended to infinite-dimensional shape spaces, and they provide a first step for a nonparametric growth model for shapes taking advantage of the widely developed framework of large deformations by diffeomorphisms.},

We begin by defining a general elastic metric on the space of parameterized surfaces. The main advantages of this metric are twofold. First, it provides a natural interpretation of elastic shape deformations that are being quantified. Second, this metric is invariant under the action of the reparameterization group. We also introduce a novel representation of surfaces termed square root normal fields or SRNFs. This representation is convenient for shape analysis because, under this representation, a reduced version of the general elastic metric becomes the simple \${\textbackslash}ensuremath\{{\textbackslash}mathbb\{L\}{\textasciicircum}2\}\$metric. Thus, this transformation greatly simplifies the implementation of our framework. We validate our approach using multiple shape analysis examples for quadrilateral and spherical surfaces. We also compare the current results with those of Kurtek et al. [1]. We show that the proposed method results in more natural shape matchings, and furthermore, has some theoretical advantages over previous methods.},

We build on the Riemannian shape analysis of anatomical and star-shaped surfaces of Kurtek et al. and focus on articulated complex shapes that undergo elastic deformations and that may contain missing parts. Our core contribution is the re-formulation of Kurtek et al.'s approach as a constrained optimization over all possible re-parameterizations of the surfaces, using a sparse set of corresponding landmarks. We introduce a landmark-constrained basis, which we use to numerically solve this optimization and therefore establish full surface registration and geodesic deformation between two surfaces. The length of the geodesic provides a measure of dissimilarity between surfaces. The advantages of this approach are: (1) simultaneous computation of full correspondence and geodesic between two surfaces, given a sparse set of matching landmarks (2) ability to handle more comprehensive deformations than nearly isometric, and (3) the geodesics and the geodesic lengths can be further used for symmetrizing 3D shapes and for computing their statistical averages. We validate the framework on challenging cases of large isometric and elastic deformations, and on surfaces with missing parts. We also provide multiple examples of averaging and symmetrizing 3D models.},

	abstract = {Recent developments in elastic shape analysis (ESA) are motivated by the fact that it provides a comprehensive framework for simultaneous registration, deformation, and comparison of shapes. These methods achieve computational efficiency using certain square-root representations that transform invariant elastic metrics into euclidean metrics, allowing for the application of standard algorithms and statistical tools. For analyzing shapes of embeddings of \${\textbackslash}mathbf S{\textasciicircum}2\$ in \${\textbackslash}mathbb R{\textasciicircum}3\$ , Jermyn et al. [1] introduced square-root normal fields (SRNFs), which transform an elastic metric, with desirable invariant properties, into the \${\textbackslash}mathbb L{\textasciicircum}2\$ metric. These SRNFs are essentially surface normals scaled by square-roots of infinitesimal area elements. A critical need in shape analysis is a method for inverting solutions (deformations, averages, modes of variations, etc.) computed in SRNF space, back to the original surface space for visualizations and inferences. Due to the lack of theory for understanding SRNF maps and their inverses, we take a numerical approach, and derive an efficient multiresolution algorithm, based on solving an optimization problem in the surface space, that estimates surfaces corresponding to given SRNFs. This solution is found to be effective even for complex shapes that undergo significant deformations including bending and stretching, e.g., human bodies and animals. We use this inversion for computing elastic shape deformations, transferring deformations, summarizing shapes, and for finding modes of variability in a given collection, while simultaneously registering the surfaces. We demonstrate the proposed algorithms using a statistical analysis of human body shapes, classification of generic surfaces, and analysis of brain structures.},

Our second contribution is a scheme for sampling the spherical domain using uniformly subdivided polyhedral domains, namely the tetrahedron, octahedron, and cube. We show that these particular semi-regular samplings can be conveniently represented as completely regular 2D grids, i.e. geometry images. Moreover, these images have simple boundary extension rules that aid many processing operations. Applications include geometry remeshing, level-of-detail, morphing, compression, and smooth surface subdivision.},

This reduces the problematic cubic complexity of Gaussian process regression in the number of time steps into linear time complexity. The representation is based on expanding periodic covariance functions into a series of stochastic resonators. The explicit representation of the canonical periodic covariance function is written out and the expansion is shown to uniformly converge to the exact covariance function with a known convergence rate. The framework is generalized to quasi-periodic covariance functions by introducing damping terms in the system and applied to two sets of real data.

	abstract = {Gaussian processes (GPs) are widely used tools for non-parametric probabilistic modelling in machine learning, spatial statistics, and signal processing. Their strength lies in flexible model specification, where prior beliefs of the model functions are encoded by the GP model. This way they can also be interpreted as specifying a probability distribution over the space of functions. In signal processing GPs are typically represented as state-space models, whereas the kernel (covariance function) representation is favoured in machine learning. Under the kernel formalism, the naïve solution to a GP regression problem scales cubically in the number of data points, which makes the approach computationally infeasible for large data sets. 
This work explores the link between the two representations, which enables the use of efficient sequential Kalman filtering based methods for solving the inference problem. These methods have linear time complexity with respect to the number of data points. The interest is in presenting an explicit connection between a large class of covariance functions and state- space models. This is done for one-dimensional (temporal) covariance functions and linear time-invariant stochastic differential equations. This class of models covers a wide range of both stationary and non-stationary GP models for encoding, for example, continuity, smoothness, or periodicity. The framework also extends to spatio-temporal models, where the GP is represented as an evolution type stochastic partial differential equation and inference conducted by infinite-dimensional Kalman filtering methods. Both separable and non- separable models are considered, and implementation techniques for numerical solutions are discussed. 
The link between stochastic differential equations and standard covariance functions widens the applicability of Gaussian processes in combination with mechanistic physical differential equation models. Temporal and spatio-temporal Gaussian process models are useful in a multitude of data-intensive applications. Examples in this work include brain image analysis, weather modelling, financial forecasting, and tracking applications.},

In this article, we discuss connections of Gaussian process regression with Kalman filtering and present methods for converting spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression problems into infinite-dimensional state-space models. This formulation allows for use of computationally efficient infinite-dimensional Kalman filtering and smoothing methods, or more general Bayesian filtering and smoothing methods, which reduces the problematic cubic complexity of Gaussian process regression in the number of time steps into linear time complexity. The implication of this is that the use of machine-learning models in signal processing becomes computationally feasible, and it opens the possibility to combine machine-learning techniques with signal processing methods.},

	abstract = {Summary. Continuously indexed Gaussian fields (GFs) are the most important ingredient in spatial statistical modelling and geostatistics. The specification through the covariance function gives an intuitive interpretation of the field properties. On the computational side, GFs are hampered with the big n problem, since the cost of factorizing dense matrices is cubic in the dimension. Although computational power today is at an all time high, this fact seems still to be a computational bottleneck in many applications. Along with GFs, there is the class of Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRFs) which are discretely indexed. The Markov property makes the precision matrix involved sparse, which enables the use of numerical algorithms for sparse matrices, that for fields in only use the square root of the time required by general algorithms. The specification of a GMRF is through its full conditional distributions but its marginal properties are not transparent in such a parameterization. We show that, using an approximate stochastic weak solution to (linear) stochastic partial differential equations, we can, for some GFs in the Matérn class, provide an explicit link, for any triangulation of , between GFs and GMRFs, formulated as a basis function representation. The consequence is that we can take the best from the two worlds and do the modelling by using GFs but do the computations by using GMRFs. Perhaps more importantly, our approach generalizes to other covariance functions generated by SPDEs, including oscillating and non-stationary GFs, as well as GFs on manifolds. We illustrate our approach by analysing global temperature data with a non-stationary model defined on a sphere.},

	abstract = {Gaussian processes are an effective model class for learning unknown functions, particularly in settings where accurately representing predictive uncertainty is of key importance. Motivated by applications in the physical sciences, the widely-used Matérn class of Gaussian processes has recently been generalized to model functions whose domains are Riemannian manifolds, by re-expressing said processes as solutions of stochastic partial differential equations. In this work, we propose techniques for computing the kernels of these processes on compact Riemannian manifolds via spectral theory of the Laplace-Beltrami operator in a fully constructive manner, thereby allowing them to be trained via standard scalable techniques such as inducing point methods. We also extend the generalization from the Matérn to the widely-used squared exponential Gaussian process. By allowing Riemannian Matérn Gaussian processes to be trained using well-understood techniques, our work enables their use in mini-batch, online, and non-conjugate settings, and makes them more accessible to machine learning practitioners.},

In this work, we leverage the stochastic partial differential equation characterization of Matérn Gaussian processes—a widely-used model class in the Euclidean setting—to study their analog for undirected graphs. We show that the resulting Gaussian processes inherit various attractive properties of their Euclidean and Riemannian analogs and provide techniques that allow them to be trained using standard methods, such as inducing points. This enables graph Matérn Gaussian processes to be employed in mini-batch and non-conjugate settings, thereby making them more accessible to practitioners and easier to deploy within larger learning frameworks.},

Building on this, we develop tools for the statistical shape analysis of sets of surfaces, including methods for estimating Karcher means and performing tangent PCA on shape populations, and for computing parallel transport along paths of surfaces. Our proposed approach fundamentally relies on a relaxed variational formulation for the geodesic matching problem via the use of varifold ﬁdelity terms, which enable us to enforce reparametrization independence when computing geodesics between unparametrized surfaces, while also yielding versatile algorithms that allow us to compare surfaces with varying sampling or mesh structures. Importantly, we demonstrate how our relaxed variational framework can be extended to tackle partially observed data.
