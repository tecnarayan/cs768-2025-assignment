                  any concept representable as a boolean function or
                  circuit, with the help of a teacher who breaks the
                  concept into subconcepts and teaches one subconcept
                  per lesson. Each subconcept corresponds to a gate in
                  the boolean circuit.  The learner learns each
                  subconcept from examples which have been randomly
                  drawn according to an arbitrary probability
                  distribution, and labeled as positive or negative
                  instances of the subconcept by the teacher. The
                  learning procedure runs in time polynomial in the
                  size of the circuit.  The learner outputs not the
                  unknown boolean circuit, but rather a program which,
                  for any input, either produces the same answer as
                  the unknown boolean circuit, or else says ``I don't
                  know.'' Thus the output of this learning procedure is
                  \emph{reliable}.  Furthermore, with high probability the
                  output program is nearly always \emph{useful} in that it
                  says ``I don't know'' very rarely. A key technique is
                  to maintain a hierarchy of explicit ``version
                  spaces.''  Our main contribution is thus a learning
                  procedure whose output is reliable and nearly always
                  useful; this has not been previously accomplished
                  within Valiant's model of learnability.
