abstract = {We introduce the smoothed analysis of algorithms, which continuously interpolates between the worst-case and average-case analyses of algorithms. In smoothed analysis, we measure the maximum over inputs of the expected performance of an algorithm under small random perturbations of that input. We measure this performance in terms of both the input size and the magnitude of the perturbations. We show that the simplex algorithm has smoothed complexity polynomial in the input size and the standard deviation of Gaussian perturbations.},

  abstract = 	 {Much of modern learning theory has been split between two regimes: the classical offline setting, where data arrive independently, and the online setting, where data arrive adversarially. While the former model is often both computationally and statistically tractable, the latter requires no distributional assumptions. In an attempt to achieve the best of both worlds, previous work proposed the smooth online setting where each sample is drawn from an adversarially chosen distribution, which is smooth, i.e., it has a bounded density with respect to a fixed dominating measure. Existing results for the smooth setting were known only for binary-valued function classes and were computation- ally expensive in general; in this paper, we fill these lacunae. In particular, we provide tight bounds on the minimax regret of learning a nonparametric function class, with nearly optimal dependence on both the horizon and smoothness parameters. Furthermore, we provide the first oracle-efficient, no-regret algorithms in this setting. In particular, we propose an oracle-efficient improper algorithm whose regret achieves optimal dependence on the horizon and a proper algorithm requiring only a single oracle call per round whose regret has the optimal horizon dependence in the classification setting and is sublinear in general. Both algorithms have exponentially worse dependence on the smoothness parameter of the adversary than the minimax rate. We then prove a lower bound on the oracle complexity of any proper learning algorithm, which matches the oracle-efficient upper bounds up to a polynomial factor, thus demonstrating the existence of a statistical-computational gap in smooth online learning. Finally, we apply our results to the contextual bandit setting to show that if a function class is learnable in the classical setting, then there is an oracle-efficient, no-regret algorithm for contextual bandits in the case that contexts arrive in a smooth manner.}

abstract = {The US COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey (CTIS) has operated continuously since April 6, 2020, collecting over 20 million responses. As the largest public health survey conducted in the United States to date, CTIS was designed to facilitate detailed demographic and geographic analyses, track trends over time, and accommodate rapid revision to address emerging priorities. Using examples of CTIS results illuminating trends in symptoms, risks, mitigating behaviors, testing, and vaccination in relation to evolving high-priority policy questions over 12 mo of the pandemic, we illustrate the value of online surveys for tracking patterns and trends in COVID outcomes as an adjunct to official reporting, and showcase unique insights that would not be visible through traditional public health reporting. The US COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey (CTIS) is a large, cross-sectional, internet-based survey that has operated continuously since April 6, 2020. By inviting a random sample of Facebook active users each day, CTIS collects information about COVID-19 symptoms, risks, mitigating behaviors, mental health, testing, vaccination, and other key priorities. The large scale of the survey—over 20 million responses in its first year of operation—allows tracking of trends over short timescales and allows comparisons at fine demographic and geographic detail. The survey has been repeatedly revised to respond to emerging public health priorities. In this paper, we describe the survey methods and content and give examples of CTIS results that illuminate key patterns and trends and help answer high-priority policy questions relevant to the COVID-19 epidemic and response. These results demonstrate how large online surveys can provide continuous, real-time indicators of important outcomes that are not subject to public health reporting delays and backlogs. The CTIS offers high value as a supplement to official reporting data by supplying essential information about behaviors, attitudes toward policy and preventive measures, economic impacts, and other topics not reported in public health surveillance systems.}}

	abstract = {Introduction
Vaccination represents an important strategy to mitigate COVID-19 related morbidity and mortality by protecting against severe forms of the disease and reducing hospitalization and death rates. In this sense, the objective of this study is to estimate the prevalence of Vaccination Intention (VI) against COVID-19 in Latin America and Caribbean (LAC).
Methods
We conducted a systematic review with a comprehensive search strategy for the following databases: PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science. A random-effect model meta-analysis was carried out using observational studies assessing the intention to vaccines against COVID-19 in LAC countries. The Clopper-Pearson method was used to estimate 95\% Confidence Intervals. The quality assessment was developed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale adapted for cross-sectional studies. A subgroup analysis by study location and a sensitivity analysis were developed.
Results
Nineteen cross-sectional studies were included. Five meta-analyzes were performed according to the target population of the included studies. The VI in the general population of LAC was 78.0\% (95\%CI: 74.0\%–82.0\%). The VI for non-pregnant women was 78.0\% (95\%CI: 58.0\%–99.0\%), for elderly population was 63.0\% (95\%CI: 59.0\%–69.0\%), for pregnant women was 69.0\% (95\%CI: 61.0\%–76.0\%) and for health-personnel was 83.0\% (95\% CI: 71.0\%–96.0\%). The sensitivity analysis for general population meta-analysis that included only low risk of bias studies showed a 77.0\% VI (95\%CI: 73.0\%–82.0\%) and for non-pregnant women, 85.0\% VI (95\%CI: 79.0\%–90.0\%).
Conclusion
Despite the high prevalence of VI in general population found in our study, VI prevalence from elderly people and pregnant women are lower than other population groups and overall population.},

abstract = {Severe COVID-19 in children is rare, but many schools remain closed because the transmission risk that school contact poses to adults and the wider community is unknown. Observing the heterogeneity of approaches taken among U.S. school districts, Lessler et al. investigated how different strategies influence COVID-19 transmission rates in the wider community using COVID-19 Symptom Survey data from Carnegie Mellon and Facebook. The authors found that when mitigation measures are in place, transmission within schools is limited and infection rates mirror that of the surrounding community. Science, abh2939, this issue p. 1092 COVID-19 rates were elevated for those connected to schools that implemented few or no mitigation measures. In-person schooling has proved contentious and difficult to study throughout the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. Data from a massive online survey in the United States indicate an increased risk of COVID-19–related outcomes among respondents living with a child attending school in person. School-based mitigation measures are associated with significant reductions in risk, particularly daily symptoms screens, teacher masking, and closure of extracurricular activities. A positive association between in-person schooling and COVID-19 outcomes persists at low levels of mitigation, but when seven or more mitigation measures are reported, a significant relationship is no longer observed. Among teachers, working outside the home was associated with an increase in COVID-19–related outcomes, but this association is similar to that observed in other occupations (e.g., health care or office work). Although in-person schooling is associated with household COVID-19 risk, this risk can likely be controlled with properly implemented school-based mitigation measures.}}

abstract = {Abstract Background While other studies have reported estimates of COVID-19 vaccine uptake by broad occupational group, little is known about vaccine uptake by detailed occupational category. Methods Data on COVID-19 vaccination were provided by US adults ages ≥18 years old who responded to the Facebook/Delphi Group COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey (Delphi US CTIS) in April–May 2021, reported working for pay in the past 4 weeks, and answered questions about their COVID-19 vaccine status. Percentages of occupational groups reporting having had at least one COVID-19 vaccination were weighted to resemble the US general population and calculated for 23 major occupational groups and 120 detailed occupational categories in 15 major groups. Results COVID-19 vaccine uptake for all 828,401 working adult respondents was 73.6\%. Uptake varied considerably across the 23 major occupational groups, from 45.7\% for Construction and Extraction to 87.9\% for Education, Training, and Library. Percentage vaccinated was also very low for Installation, Maintenance, and Repair at 52.1\% and Farming, Fishing, and Forestry at 53.9\%. Among the 120 detailed occupational categories, the highest percentage vaccinated was 93.9\% for Postsecondary Teacher and the three lowest values were 39.1\% for Any Extraction Worker in Oil, Gas, Mining, or Quarrying; 40.1\% for Vehicle or Mobile Equipment Mechanic, Installer, or Repairer; and 42.0\% for Any Construction Trades Worker. Conclusion Low vaccination percentages were seen in many US occupations by the end of May 2021, early in the period of widespread availability of vaccines for adults. These findings could help inform the deployment of occupation-specific vaccinepromotion activities during future viral epidemics and pandemics.},

abstract = {The US COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey (CTIS) has operated continuously since April 6, 2020, collecting over 20 million responses. As the largest public health survey conducted in the United States to date, CTIS was designed to facilitate detailed demographic and geographic analyses, track trends over time, and accommodate rapid revision to address emerging priorities. Using examples of CTIS results illuminating trends in symptoms, risks, mitigating behaviors, testing, and vaccination in relation to evolving high-priority policy questions over 12 mo of the pandemic, we illustrate the value of online surveys for tracking patterns and trends in COVID outcomes as an adjunct to official reporting, and showcase unique insights that would not be visible through traditional public health reporting. The US COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey (CTIS) is a large, cross-sectional, internet-based survey that has operated continuously since April 6, 2020. By inviting a random sample of Facebook active users each day, CTIS collects information about COVID-19 symptoms, risks, mitigating behaviors, mental health, testing, vaccination, and other key priorities. The large scale of the survey—over 20 million responses in its first year of operation—allows tracking of trends over short timescales and allows comparisons at fine demographic and geographic detail. The survey has been repeatedly revised to respond to emerging public health priorities. In this paper, we describe the survey methods and content and give examples of CTIS results that illuminate key patterns and trends and help answer high-priority policy questions relevant to the COVID-19 epidemic and response. These results demonstrate how large online surveys can provide continuous, real-time indicators of important outcomes that are not subject to public health reporting delays and backlogs. The CTIS offers high value as a supplement to official reporting data by supplying essential information about behaviors, attitudes toward policy and preventive measures, economic impacts, and other topics not reported in public health surveillance systems.}}
