    abstract = { Abstract. We study the problem of generating a hyperplane tessellation of an arbitrary set \(T\) in \(\mathbb{R}^n\) , ensuring that the Euclidean distance between any two points corresponds to the fraction of hyperplanes separating them up to a prespecified error \(\delta\) . We focus on random Gaussian tessellations with uniformly distributed shifts and derive sharp bounds on the number of hyperplanes \(m\) that are required. This result has natural applications in data dimension reduction—it yields a binary version of the Johnson–Lindenstrauss embedding—and signal processing under coarse quantization. Surprisingly, our lower estimates falsify the conjecture that \(m\sim \ell\_*^2(T)/\delta^2\) , where \(\ell\_*(T)\) is the Gaussian width of \(T\) , is optimal. This conjecture is the natural analogue of a conjecture by Plan and Vershynin on random tessellations of subsets of the Euclidean sphere. As it turns out, the true optimal rate is larger by an order of magnitude in the accuracy parameter \(\delta\) and depends in an intricate way on the geometry of the set. In particular, we give an explicit example where \(m \sim \ell\_*^2(T)/\delta^3\) is required. To the best of our knowledge, the fact that the optimal error decay rate depends on the geometry of the set \(T\) is a new phenomenon in the general context of random embeddings. }

  abstract = 	 {Random feature maps are ubiquitous in modern statistical machine learning, where they generalize random projections by means of powerful, yet often difficult to analyze nonlinear operators. In this paper we leverage the "concentration" phenomenon induced by random matrix theory to perform a spectral analysis on the Gram matrix of these random feature maps, here for Gaussian mixture models of simultaneously large dimension and size. Our results are instrumental to a deeper understanding on the interplay of the nonlinearity and the statistics of the data, thereby allowing for a better tuning of random feature-based techniques.}
