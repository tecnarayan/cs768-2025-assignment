@article{psych5040071,
	abstract = {This paper explores the dual-processing hypothesis of the mind, Systems 1 and 2, by examining debates between cognitive and evolutionary psychologists. I structure the discussion in a back-and-forth manner to emphasize the differences. I show that, while the majority of cognitive psychologists now embrace the dual-processing theory of the mind, Systems 1 and 2, there are still some who disagree. Most evolutionary psychologists, in contrast, dispute the existence of System 2, a domain-general mind, although some disagree. However, a consensus is growing in favor of System 2, although evolutionary psychologists&rsquo; concerns must be addressed. The uniqueness of this review is that it contrasts the perspectives of cognitive psychologists with evolutionary psychologists, which is uncommon in the cognitive psychology literature, which tends to overlook evolutionary viewpoints.},
