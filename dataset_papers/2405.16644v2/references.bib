  abstract = 	 {We study the problem of solving strongly convex and smooth unconstrained optimization problems using stochastic first-order algorithms. We devise a novel algorithm, referred to as \emph{Recursive One-Over-T SGD} (ROOT-SGD), based on an easily implementable, recursive averaging of past stochastic gradients. We prove that it simultaneously achieves state-of-the-art performance in both a finite-sample, nonasymptotic sense and an asymptotic sense. On the nonasymptotic side, we prove risk bounds on the last iterate of ROOT-SGD with leading-order terms that match the optimal statistical risk with a unity pre-factor, along with a higher-order term that scales at the sharp rate of $O(n^{-3/2})$ under the Lipschitz condition on the Hessian matrix. On the asymptotic side, we show that when a mild, one-point Hessian continuity condition is imposed, the rescaled last iterate of (multi-epoch) ROOT-SGD converges asymptotically to a Gaussian limit with the Cramér-Rao optimal asymptotic covariance, for a broad range of step-size choices.}

	abstract = {TD.$\lambda$/ is a popular family of algorithms for approximate policy evaluation in large MDPs. TD.$\lambda$/ works by incrementally updating the value function after each observed transition. It has two major drawbacks: it may make inefficient use of data, and it requires the user to manually tune a stepsize schedule for good performance. For the case of linear value function approximations and $\lambda$ = 0, the Least-Squares TD (LSTD) algorithm of Bradtke and Barto (1996, Machine learning, 22:1--3, 33--57) eliminates all stepsize parameters and improves data efficiency.},

  abstract = 	 {We analyze the novel Local SGD  in federated Learning, a multi-round estimation procedure that uses intermittent communication to improve communication efficiency. Under a $2{+}\delta$ moment condition on stochastic gradients, we first establish a {\it functional central limit theorem} that shows the averaged iterates of Local SGD converge weakly to a rescaled Brownian motion. We next provide two iterative inference methods: the {\it plug-in} and the {\it random scaling}. Random scaling constructs an asymptotically pivotal statistic for inference by using the information along the whole Local SGD path. Both the methods are communication efficient and applicable to online data. Our results show that Local SGD simultaneously achieves both statistical efficiency and communication efficiency.}
