In this paper, we give a faster width-dependent algorithm for mixed
packing-covering LPs. Mixed packing-covering LPs are fundamental to
combinatorial optimization in computer science and operations research. Our
algorithm finds a $1+\eps$ approximate solution in time $O(Nw/ \eps)$, where
$N$ is number of nonzero entries in the constraint matrix and $w$ is the
maximum number of nonzeros in any constraint. This run-time is better than
Nesterov's smoothing algorithm which requires $O(N\sqrt{n}w/ \eps)$ where $n$
is the dimension of the problem. Our work utilizes the framework of area
convexity introduced in [Sherman-FOCS'17] to obtain the best dependence on
$\eps$ while breaking the infamous $\ell_{\infty}$ barrier to eliminate the
factor of $\sqrt{n}$. The current best width-independent algorithm for this
problem runs in time $O(N/\eps^2)$ [Young-arXiv-14] and hence has worse running
time dependence on $\eps$. Many real life instances of the mixed
packing-covering problems exhibit small width and for such cases, our algorithm
can report higher precision results when compared to width-independent
algorithms. As a special case of our result, we report a $1+\eps$ approximation
algorithm for the densest subgraph problem which runs in time $O(md/ \eps)$,
where $m$ is the number of edges in the graph and $d$ is the maximum graph
degree.
