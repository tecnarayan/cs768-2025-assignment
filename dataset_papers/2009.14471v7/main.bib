    abstract = { We consider decentralized control of Markov decision processes and give complexity bounds on the worst-case running time for algorithms that find optimal solutions. Generalizations of both the fully observable case and the partially observable case that allow for decentralized control are described. For even two agents, the finite-horizon problems corresponding to both of these models are hard for nondeterministic exponential time. These complexity results illustrate a fundamental difference between centralized and decentralized control of Markov decision processes. In contrast to the problems involving centralized control, the problems we consider provably do not admit polynomial-time algorithms. Furthermore, assuming EXP â‰  NEXP, the problems require superexponential time to solve in the worst case. }

abstract = {Decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes (Dec-POMDPs) are general models for decentralized decision making under uncertainty. However, they typically model a problem at a low level of granularity, where each agent's actions are primitive operations lasting exactly one time step. We address the case where each agent has macro-actions: temporally extended actions which may require different amounts of time to execute. We model macro-actions as 'options' in a factored Dec-POMDP model, focusing on options which depend only on information available to an individual agent while executing. This enables us to model systems where coordination decisions only occur at the level of deciding which macro-actions to execute, and the macro-actions themselves can then be executed to completion. The core technical difficulty when using options in a Dec-POMDP is that the options chosen by the agents no longer terminate at the same time. We present extensions of two leading Dec-POMDP algorithms for generating a policy with options and discuss the resulting form of optimality. Our results show that these algorithms retain agent coordination while allowing near-optimal solutions to be generated for significantly longer horizons and larger state-spaces than previous Dec-POMDP methods.},
