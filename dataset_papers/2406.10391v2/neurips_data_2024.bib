    abstract = "{Effective embedding is actively conducted by applying deep learning to biomolecular information. Obtaining better embeddings enhances the quality of downstream analyses, such as DNA sequence motif detection and protein function prediction. In this study, we adopt a pre-training algorithm for the effective embedding of RNA bases to acquire semantically rich representations and apply this algorithm to two fundamental RNA sequence problems: structural alignment and clustering. By using the pre-training algorithm to embed the four bases of RNA in a position-dependent manner using a large number of RNA sequences from various RNA families, a context-sensitive embedding representation is obtained. As a result, not only base information but also secondary structure and context information of RNA sequences are embedded for each base. We call this â€˜informative base embeddingâ€™ and use it to achieve accuracies superior to those of existing state-of-the-art methods on RNA structural alignment and RNA family clustering tasks. Furthermore, upon performing RNA sequence alignment by combining this informative base embedding with a simple Needlemanâ€“Wunsch alignment algorithm, we succeed in calculating structural alignments with a time complexity of O(n2) instead of the O(n6) time complexity of the naive implementation of Sankoff-style algorithm for input RNA sequence of length n.}",

              sequencing. These methods have allowed the first glimpse of the
              'RNA structurome'.These studies have highlighted, on a
              genome-wide scale, how RNA structure controls functions and gene
              expression. It is now possible to identify structural motifs that
              affect both coding and non-coding RNA function.Each step of
              protein translation is affected by RNA structure. Generally, the
              RNA surrounding the start and stops codons is poorly structured
              to allow ribosome regulation, and the coding region contains
              structured elements that can regulate protein
              expression.Small-RNA-binding sites that regulate mRNA expression
              can be identified through degradome and immunoprecipitation
              studies to help to predict new small RNAs and their
              targets.Recent in vivo studies indicate that RNA is less
              structured, or at least more structurally dynamic, in vivo than
              in vitro.The future of this research field is likely to explore

These dynamics accompany and guide, for example, RNA cotranscriptional folding, ligand sensing and signaling, site-specific catalysis in ribozymes, and the hierarchically ordered assembly of ribonucleoproteins. RNA dynamics are encoded by both the inherent properties of RNA structure, spanning many motional modes with a large range of amplitudes and timescales, and external trigger factors, ranging from proteins, nucleic acids, metal ions, metabolites, and vitamins to temperature and even directional RNA biosynthesis itself. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of RNA dynamics as highlighted by biophysical tools.}

               multimegadalton ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex comprised of
               five snRNPs and numerous proteins. Intricate RNA-RNA and RNP
               networks, which serve to align the reactive groups of the
               pre-mRNA for catalysis, are formed and repeatedly rearranged
               during spliceosome assembly and catalysis. Both the conformation
               and composition of the spliceosome are highly dynamic, affording
               the splicing machinery its accuracy and flexibility, and these
               remarkable dynamics are largely conserved between yeast and
               metazoans. Because of its dynamic and complex nature, obtaining
               structural information about the spliceosome represents a major
               challenge. Electron microscopy has revealed the general
               morphology of several spliceosomal complexes and their snRNP
               subunits, and also the spatial arrangement of some of their
               components. X-ray and NMR studies have provided high resolution
               structure information about spliceosomal proteins alone or
               complexed with one or more binding partners. The extensive
               interplay of RNA and proteins in aligning the pre-mRNA's
               reactive groups, and the presence of both RNA and protein at the
               core of the splicing machinery, suggest that the spliceosome is
               an RNP enzyme. However, elucidation of the precise nature of the

  abstract  = "The central dogma of gene expression is that DNA is transcribed
               into messenger RNAs, which in turn serve as the template for
               protein synthesis. The discovery of extensive transcription of
               large RNA transcripts that do not code for proteins, termed long
               noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), provides an important new perspective
               on the centrality of RNA in gene regulation. Here, we discuss
               genome-scale strategies to discover and characterize lncRNAs. An
               emerging theme from multiple model systems is that lncRNAs form
               extensive networks of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes with
               numerous chromatin regulators and then target these enzymatic
               activities to appropriate locations in the genome. Consistent
               with this notion, lncRNAs can function as modular scaffolds to
               specify higher-order organization in RNP complexes and in
               chromatin states. The importance of these modes of regulation is

In contrast, the existing nucleotide databases were not consolidated to facilitate wider and deeper homology search. Here, we built a comprehensive database by including the non-coding RNA (ncRNA) sequences from RNAcentral, the transcriptome assembly and metagenome assembly from metagenomics RAST (MG-RAST), the genomic sequences from Genome Warehouse (GWH), and the genomic sequences from MGnify, in addition to nucleotide database (nt) and its subsets in National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The resulting Master database of All possible RNA sequences (MARS) is 20-fold larger than NCBIâ€™s nt database or 60-fold larger than RNAcentral. The new dataset along with a new splitâ€“search strategy allows a substantial improvement in homology search over existing state-of-the-art techniques. It also yields more accurate and more sensitive multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) than manually curated MSAs from Rfam for the majority of structured RNAs mapped to Rfam. The results indicate that MARS coupled with the fully automatic homology search tool RNAcmap will be useful for improved structural and functional inference of ncRNAs and RNA language models based on MSAs.

  abstract  = "mRNA polyadenylation is a critical cellular process in
               eukaryotes. It involves 3' end cleavage of nascent mRNAs and
               addition of the poly(A) tail, which plays important roles in
               many aspects of the cellular metabolism of mRNA. The process is
               controlled by various cis-acting elements surrounding the
               cleavage site, and their binding factors. In this study, we
               surveyed genome regions containing cleavage sites [herein called
               poly(A) sites], for 13,942 human and 11,155 mouse genes. We
               found that a great proportion of human and mouse genes have
               alternative polyadenylation ( approximately 54 and 32\%,
               respectively). The conservation of alternative polyadenylation
               type or polyadenylation configuration between human and mouse
               orthologs is statistically significant, indicating that
               alternative polyadenylation is widely employed by these two
               species to produce alternative gene transcripts. Genes belonging
               to several functional groups, indicated by their Gene Ontology
               annotations, are biased with respect to polyadenylation
               configuration. Many poly(A) sites harbor multiple cleavage sites
               (51.25\% human and 46.97\% mouse sites), leading to
               heterogeneous 3' end formation for transcripts. This implies
               that the cleavage process of polyadenylation is largely
               imprecise. Different types of poly(A) sites, with regard to
               their relative locations in a gene, are found to have distinct
               nucleotide composition in surrounding genomic regions. This
               large-scale study provides important insights into the mechanism

               structure. Due to the difficulties in experimentally assessing
               structures of large RNAs, there is currently great demand for
               new high-resolution structure prediction methods. We present the
               novel method for the fully automated prediction of RNA 3D
               structures from a user-defined secondary structure. The concept
               is founded on the machine translation system. The translation
               engine operates on the RNA FRABASE database tailored to the
               dictionary relating the RNA secondary structure and tertiary
               structure elements. The translation algorithm is very fast.
               Initial 3D structure is composed in a range of seconds on a
               single processor. The method assures the prediction of large RNA
               3D structures of high quality. Our approach needs neither
               structural templates nor RNA sequence alignment, required for
               comparative methods. This enables the building of unresolved yet
               native and artificial RNA structures. The method is implemented
               in a publicly available, user-friendly server RNAComposer. It
               works in an interactive mode and a batch mode. The batch mode is
               designed for large-scale modelling and accepts atomic distance

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: The recent discoveries of microRNA (miRNA) genes and
               characterization of the first few target genes regulated by
               miRNAs in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster
               have set the stage for elucidation of a novel network of
               regulatory control. We present a computational method for
               whole-genome prediction of miRNA target genes. The method is
               validated using known examples. For each miRNA, target genes are
               selected on the basis of three properties: sequence
               complementarity using a position-weighted local alignment
               algorithm, free energies of RNA-RNA duplexes, and conservation
               of target sites in related genomes. Application to the D.
               melanogaster, Drosophila pseudoobscura and Anopheles gambiae
               genomes identifies several hundred target genes potentially
               regulated by one or more known miRNAs. RESULTS: These potential
               targets are rich in genes that are expressed at specific
               developmental stages and that are involved in cell fate
               specification, morphogenesis and the coordination of
               developmental processes, as well as genes that are active in the
               mature nervous system. High-ranking target genes are enriched in
               transcription factors two-fold and include genes already known
               to be under translational regulation. Our results reaffirm the
               thesis that miRNAs have an important role in establishing the
               complex spatial and temporal patterns of gene activity necessary
               for the orderly progression of development and suggest
               additional roles in the function of the mature organism. In
               addition the results point the way to directed experiments to
               determine miRNA functions. CONCLUSIONS: The emerging
               combinatorics of miRNA target sites in the 3' untranslated
               regions of messenger RNAs are reminiscent of transcriptional
               regulation in promoter regions of DNA, with both one-to-many and
               many-to-one relationships between regulator and target.
               Typically, more than one miRNA regulates one message, indicative
               of cooperative translational control. Conversely, one miRNA may
               have several target genes, reflecting target multiplicity. As a
               guide to focused experiments, we provide detailed online
               information about likely target genes and binding sites in their
               untranslated regions, organized by miRNA or by gene and ranked
               by likelihood of match. The target prediction algorithm is

               closely related with the occurrence and development of some

               with de novo assembly have identified a large number of novel

               implies the importance of identifying the binding proteins of
               lncRNAs in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the
               functions of lncRNAs. Only a few approaches are available for
               predicting interactions between lncRNAs and proteins. In this
               study, we introduce a new method lncPro. RESULTS: By encoding
               RNA and protein sequences into numeric vectors, we used matrix
               multiplication to score each RNA-protein pair. This score can be
               used to measure the interactions between an RNA-protein pair.
               This method effectively discriminates interacting and
               non-interacting RNA-protein pairs and predicts RNA-protein
               interactions within a given complex. Applying this method on all

              learning-based models have achieved high performance in terms of
              prediction accuracy, overfitting is a common risk for such highly
              parameterized models. Here we show that overfitting can be
              minimized when RNA folding scores learnt using a deep neural
              network are integrated together with Turner's nearest-neighbor
              free energy parameters. Training the model with thermodynamic
              regularization ensures that folding scores and the calculated
              free energy are as close as possible. In computational
              experiments designed for newly discovered non-coding RNAs, our
              algorithm (MXfold2) achieves the most robust and accurate
              predictions of RNA secondary structures without sacrificing
              computational efficiency compared to several other algorithms.
              The results suggest that integrating thermodynamic information

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: To understand an RNA sequence's mechanism of action,
               the structure must be known. Furthermore, target RNA structure
               is an important consideration in the design of small interfering
               RNAs and antisense DNA oligonucleotides. RNA secondary structure
               prediction, using thermodynamics, can be used to develop
               hypotheses about the structure of an RNA sequence. RESULTS:
               RNAstructure is a software package for RNA secondary structure
               prediction and analysis. It uses thermodynamics and utilizes the
               most recent set of nearest neighbor parameters from the Turner
               group. It includes methods for secondary structure prediction
               (using several algorithms), prediction of base pair
               probabilities, bimolecular structure prediction, and prediction
               of a structure common to two sequences. This contribution
               describes new extensions to the package, including a library of
               C++ classes for incorporation into other programs, a
               user-friendly graphical user interface written in JAVA, and new
               Unix-style text interfaces. The original graphical user
               interface for Microsoft Windows is still maintained. CONCLUSION:
               The extensions to RNAstructure serve to make RNA secondary
               structure prediction user-friendly. The package is available for

Disturbances in splicing due to mutation lead to dysregulated protein expression and contribute to a substantial fraction of human disease. Several classes of splicing modulator compounds (SMCs) have been recently identified and establish that pre-mRNA splicing represents a target for therapy. We describe herein the identification of BPN-15477, a SMC that restores correct splicing of ELP1 exon 20. Using transcriptome sequencing from treated fibroblast cells and a machine learning approach, we identify BPN-15477 responsive sequence signatures. We then leverage this model to discover 155 human disease genes harboring ClinVar mutations predicted to alter pre-mRNA splicing as targets for BPN-15477. Splicing assays confirm successful correction of splicing defects caused by mutations in CFTR, LIPA, MLH1 and MAPT. Subsequent validations in two disease-relevant cellular models demonstrate that BPN-15477 increases functional protein, confirming the clinical potential of our predictions.},

               interplay with microRNAs and translation efficiency. Although
               existing tools can predict m6A at single-base resolution, it is
               still challenging to extract the biological information
               surrounding m6A sites. RESULTS: We implemented a deep learning
               framework, named DeepM6ASeq, to predict m6A-containing sequences
               and characterize surrounding biological features based on
               miCLIP-Seq data, which detects m6A sites at single-base
               resolution. DeepM6ASeq showed better performance as compared to

               modification owing to its involvement in many biological
               processes. The prediction of m6A sites is crucial because it can
               provide a better understanding of their functional mechanisms.
               In this regard, although experimental methods are useful, they
               are time consuming. Previously, researchers have attempted to
               predict m6A sites using computational methods to overcome the
               limitations of experimental methods. Some of these approaches
               are based on classical machine-learning techniques that rely on
               handcrafted features and require domain knowledge, whereas other
               methods are based on deep learning. However, both methods lack

               interior messenger RNA (mRNA) modification that plays an
               important function in cell development. N6A is found in all

               splicing, immune tolerance, regulatory functions, RNA
               processing, and cancer. Despite the crucial role of m6A in
               cells, it was targeted computationally, but unfortunately, the
               obtained results were unsatisfactory. It is imperative to
               develop an efficient computational model that can truly
               represent m6A sites. In this regard, an intelligent and highly
               discriminative computational model namely: m6A-word2vec is
               introduced for the discrimination of m6A sites. Here, a concept
               of natural language processing in the form of word2vec is used
               to represent the motif of the target class automatically. These
               motifs (numerical descriptors) are automatically targeted from
               the human genome without any clear definition. Further, the
               extracted feature space is then forwarded to the convolution
               neural network model as input for prediction. The developed
               computational model obtained 83.17\%, 92.69\%, and 90.50\%

               validate that the developed intelligent computational model
               showed better performance compared to existing computational
               models. It is thus greatly estimated that the introduced
               computational model ``m6A-word2vec'' may be a supportive and

               structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their
               function. Through an enormous experimental effort1-4, the
               structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been
               determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the
               billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is
               bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort
               required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate
               computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to
               enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the
               three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based
               solely on its amino acid sequence-the structure prediction
               component of the 'protein folding problem'8-has been an
               important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite
               recent progress10-14, existing methods fall far short of atomic
               accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available.
               Here we provide the first computational method that can
               regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even
               in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an
               entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model,
               AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of
               protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy
               competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases
               and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest
               version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that
               incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein
               structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design
               of the deep learning algorithm.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Recently, deep neural networks have been
               successfully applied in many biological fields. In 2020, a deep
               learning model AlphaFold won the protein folding competition
               with predicted structures within the error tolerance of
               experimental methods. However, this solution to the most
               prominent bioinformatic challenge of the past 50 years has been
               possible only thanks to a carefully curated benchmark of
               experimentally predicted protein structures. In Genomics, we
               have similar challenges (annotation of genomes and
               identification of functional elements) but currently, we lack
               benchmarks similar to protein folding competition. RESULTS: Here
               we present a collection of curated and easily accessible
               sequence classification datasets in the field of genomics. The
               proposed collection is based on a combination of novel datasets
               constructed from the mining of publicly available databases and
               existing datasets obtained from published articles. The
               collection currently contains nine datasets that focus on
               regulatory elements (promoters, enhancers, open chromatin
               region) from three model organisms: human, mouse, and roundworm.
               A simple convolution neural network is also included in a
               repository and can be used as a baseline model. Benchmarks and
               the baseline model are distributed as the Python package
               'genomic-benchmarks', and the code is available at
               https://github.com/ML-Bioinfo-CEITEC/genomic\_benchmarks .
               CONCLUSIONS: Deep learning techniques revolutionized many
               biological fields but mainly thanks to the carefully curated
               benchmarks. For the field of Genomics, we propose a collection
               of benchmark datasets for the classification of genomic
               sequences with an interface for the most commonly used deep
               learning libraries, implementation of the simple neural network
               and a training framework that can be used as a starting point
               for future research. The main aim of this effort is to create a
               repository for shared datasets that will make machine learning
               for genomics more comparable and reproducible while reducing the
               overhead of researchers who want to enter the field, leading to
               healthy competition and new discoveries.",

To explore RNA-based therapeutics and applications, computational structure prediction and design approaches play a vital role. Among these approaches, deep learning (DL) algorithms show great promise. However, the adoption of DL methods in the RNA community is limited due to various challenges. DL practitioners often underestimate data homologies, causing skepticism in the field. Additionally, the absence of standardized benchmarks hampers result comparison, while tackling low-level tasks requires significant effort. Moreover, assessing performance and visualizing results prove to be non-trivial and task-dependent. To address these obstacles, we introduce RnaBench (RnB), an open-source RNA library designed specifically for the development of deep learning algorithms that mitigate the challenges during data generation, evaluation, and visualization. It provides meticulously curated homology-aware RNA datasets and standardized RNA benchmarks, including a pioneering RNA design benchmark suite featuring a novel real-world RNA design problem. Furthermore, RnB offers baseline algorithms, both existing and novel performance measures, as well as data utilities and a comprehensive visualization module, all accessible through a user-friendly interface. By leveraging RnB, DL practitioners can rapidly develop innovative algorithms, potentially revolutionizing the field of computational RNA research.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

               gene expression would facilitate discovery in fundamental and
               applied biology. Here we combine polysome profiling of a library
               of 280,000 randomized 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) with deep
               learning to build a predictive model that relates human 5' UTR
               sequence to translation. Together with a genetic algorithm, we
               use the model to engineer new 5' UTRs that accurately direct
               specified levels of ribosome loading, providing the ability to
               tune sequences for optimal protein expression. We show that the
               same approach can be extended to chemically modified RNA, an
               important feature for applications in mRNA therapeutics and
               synthetic biology. We test 35,212 truncated human 5' UTRs and
               3,577 naturally occurring variants and show that the model
               predicts ribosome loading of these sequences. Finally, we
               provide evidence of 45 single-nucleotide variants (SNVs)
               associated with human diseases that substantially change

               high-throughput strategy to design, screen, and optimize 5' UTRs
               that enhance protein expression from a strong human
               cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. We first identify naturally
               occurring 5' UTRs with high translation efficiencies and use
               this information with in silico genetic algorithms to generate
               synthetic 5' UTRs. A total of ~12,000 5' UTRs are then screened
               using a recombinase-mediated integration strategy that greatly
               enhances the sensitivity of high-throughput screens by
               eliminating copy number and position effects that limit
               lentiviral approaches. Using this approach, we identify three
               synthetic 5' UTRs that outperform commonly used non-viral gene
               therapy plasmids in expressing protein payloads. In summary, we
               demonstrate that high-throughput screening of 5' UTR libraries
               with recombinase-mediated integration can identify genetic
               elements that enhance protein expression, which should have
