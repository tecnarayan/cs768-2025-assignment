Instead a more general setting is required, allowing for multifunctions rather than functions. The tool proposed is conditional modes estimation which, in the form of local modes, yields several branches that correspond to the local modes. A simple algorithm for computing the branches is derived. This is based on a conditional mean shift algorithm and is shown to work well in the application that is considered.},

These generalized linear models are illustrated by examples relating to four distributions; the Normal, Binomial (probit analysis, etc.), Poisson (contingency tables) and gamma (variance components). The implications of the approach in designing statistics courses are discussed.},

This relaxes the assumptions of the traditional Poisson regression model, while including it as a special case. In this paper, we describe neural network regression models with six different schemes and compare their performances in three simulated data sets, namely one linear and two nonlinear cases. From the simulation study it is found that the Poisson regression models work well when the linearity assumption is correct, but the neural network models can largely improve the prediction in nonlinear situations.},

@article{weigend1995predconditionalnn,
	Abstract = { Most traditional prediction techniques deliver a single point, usually the mean of a probability distribution. For multimodal processes, instead of predicting the mean, it is important to predict the full distribution. This article presents a new connectionist method to predict the conditional probability distribution in response to an input. The main idea is to transform the problem from a regression problem to a classification problem. The conditional probability distribution network can perform both direct predictions and iterated predictions, the latter task being specific for time series problems. We compare this new method to fuzzy logic and discuss important differences, and also demonstrate the architecture on two time series. The first is the benchmark laser series used in the Santa Fe competition, a deterministic chaotic system. The second is a time series from a Markov process which exhibits structure on two time scales. The network produces multimodal predictions for this series. We compare the predictions of the network with a nearest-neighbor predictor and find that the conditional probability network is more than twice as likely a model. },

	Abstract = {Sophisticated gated recurrent neural network architectures like LSTMs and GRUs have been shown to be highly effective in a myriad of applications. We develop an un-gated unit, the statistical recurrent unit (SRU), that is able to learn long term dependencies in data by only keeping moving averages of statistics. The SRU's architecture is simple, un-gated, and contains a comparable number of parameters to LSTMs; yet, SRUs perform favorably to more sophisticated LSTM and GRU alternatives, often outperforming one or both in various tasks. We show the efficacy of SRUs as compared to LSTMs and GRUs in an unbiased manner by optimizing respective architectures' hyperparameters for both synthetic and real-world tasks.},

	Abstract = {Autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models are a fundamental tool in time series analysis that offer intuitive modeling capability and efficient predictors. Unfortunately, the lack of globally optimal parameter estimation strategies for these models remains a problem: application studies often adopt the simpler autoregressive model that can be easily estimated by maximizing (a posteriori) likelihood. We develop a (regularized, imputed) maximum likelihood criterion that admits efficient global estimation via structured matrix norm optimization methods. An empirical evaluation demonstrates the benefits of globally optimal parameter estimation over local and moment matching approaches.},

@article{HesterStone2013,
	Abstract = {The use of robots in society could be expanded by using reinforcement learning (RL) to allow robots to learn and adapt to new situations online.
RL is a paradigm for learning sequential decision making tasks, usually formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). 
For an RL algorithm to be practical for robotic control tasks, it must learn in
very few samples, while continually taking actions in
real-time. In addition, the algorithm must learn efficiently in the face of noise, sensor/actuator delays, and continuous state features.
In this article, we present TEXPLORE, the first algorithm to address all of these challenges together. TEXPLORE is a model-based RL method that learns a random forest model of the domain which generalizes dynamics to unseen states. The agent explores states that are promising for the final policy, while ignoring states that do not appear promising. 
With sample-based planning and a novel parallel architecture, TEXPLORE can select actions continually in real-time whenever necessary. 
We empirically evaluate the importance of each component of TEXPLORE in isolation and then demonstrate the complete algorithm learning to control the velocity of an autonomous vehicle in real-time.},

@article{MunosBanditsSurvery2014,
	Abstract = {This work covers several aspects of the optimism in the face of uncertainty principle applied to large scale optimization problems under finite numerical budget. The initial motivation for the research reported here originated from the empirical success of the so-called Monte-Carlo Tree Search method popularized in computer-go and further extended to many other games as well as optimization and planning problems. Our objective is to contribute to the development of theoretical foundations of the field by characterizing the complexity of the underlying optimization problems and designing efficient algorithms with performance guarantees. The main idea presented here is that it is possible to decompose a complex decision making problem (such as an optimization problem in a large search space) into a sequence of elementary decisions, where each decision of the sequence is solved using a (stochastic) multi-armed bandit (simple mathematical model for decision making in stochastic environments). 
This so-called hierarchical bandit approach (where the reward observed by a bandit in the hierarchy is itself the return of another bandit at a deeper level) possesses the nice feature of starting the exploration by a quasi-uniform sampling of the space and then focusing progressively on the most promising area, at different scales, according to the evaluations observed so far, and eventually performing a local search around the global optima of the function. The performance of the method is assessed in terms of the optimality of the returned solution as a function of the number of function evaluations. Our main contribution to the field of function optimization is a class of hierarchical optimistic algorithms designed for general search spaces (such as metric spaces, trees, graphs, Euclidean spaces, ...) with different algorithmic instantiations depending on whether the evaluations are noisy or noiseless and whether some measure of the ''smoothness'' of the function is known or unknown. The performance of 
the algorithms depend on the local behavior of the function around its global optima expressed in terms of the quantity of near-optimal states measured with some metric. If this local smoothness of the function is known then one can design very efficient optimization algorithms (with convergence rate independent of the space dimension), and when it is not known, we can build adaptive techniques that can, in some cases, perform almost as well as when it is known.},

	Abstract = {
                  We introduce the first algorithm for learning
                  predictive state representations PSRs, which are a
                  way of representing the state of a controlled
                  dynamical system.  The state representation in a PSR
                  is a vector of predictions of tests, where tests are
                  sequences of actions and observations said to be
                  true if and only if all the observations occur given
                  that all the actions are taken.  The problem of
                  finding a good PSR---one that is a sufficient
                  statistic for the dynamical system---can be divided
                  into two parts: 1) discovery of a good set of tests,
                  and 2) learning to make accurate predictions for
                  those tests.  In this paper, we present detailed
                  empirical results using a gradient-based algorithm
                  for addressing the second problem.  Our results
                  demonstrate several sample systems in which the
                  algorithm learns to make correct predictions and
                  several situations in which the algorithm is less

Here $R=p_{min}/p_{max}$ is the ratio of the minimum and maximum state-action occupation frequencies. The results extend to convergent on-line learning provided that $p_{min}>0$, where $p_{min}$ and $p_{max}$ now become the minimum and maximum state-action occupation frequencies corresponding to the stationary distribution.},

We add an adaptive uncertainty handling based on Hoeffding and empirical Bernstein races to the CMA-ES, a variable metric evolution strategy proposed for direct policy search. The uncertainty handling adjusts individually the number of episodes considered for the evaluation of a policy. The performance estimation is kept just accurate enough for a sufficiently good ranking of candidate policies, which is in turn sufficient for the CMA-ES to find better solutions. This increases the learning speed as well as the robustness of the algorithm.},
