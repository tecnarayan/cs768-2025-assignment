Many state-of-the-art ML results have been obtained by scaling up the number
of parameters in existing models. However, parameters and activations for such
large models often do not fit in the memory of a single accelerator device;
this means that it is necessary to distribute training of large models over
multiple accelerators. In this work, we propose PipeDream-2BW, a system that
supports memory-efficient pipeline parallelism. PipeDream-2BW uses a novel
pipelining and weight gradient coalescing strategy, combined with the double
buffering of weights, to ensure high throughput, low memory footprint, and
weight update semantics similar to data parallelism. In addition, PipeDream-2BW
automatically partitions the model over the available hardware resources, while
respecting hardware constraints such as memory capacities of accelerators and
interconnect topologies. PipeDream-2BW can accelerate the training of large GPT
and BERT language models by up to 20$\times$ with similar final model accuracy.
