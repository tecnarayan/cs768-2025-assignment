Lasso, or $\ell^1$ regularized least squares, has been explored extensively
for its remarkable sparsity properties. It is shown in this paper that the
solution to Lasso, in addition to its sparsity, has robustness properties: it
is the solution to a robust optimization problem. This has two important
consequences. First, robustness provides a connection of the regularizer to a
physical property, namely, protection from noise. This allows a principled
selection of the regularizer, and in particular, generalizations of Lasso that
also yield convex optimization problems are obtained by considering different
uncertainty sets.
  Secondly, robustness can itself be used as an avenue to exploring different
properties of the solution. In particular, it is shown that robustness of the
solution explains why the solution is sparse. The analysis as well as the
specific results obtained differ from standard sparsity results, providing
different geometric intuition. Furthermore, it is shown that the robust
optimization formulation is related to kernel density estimation, and based on
this approach, a proof that Lasso is consistent is given using robustness
directly. Finally, a theorem saying that sparsity and algorithmic stability
contradict each other, and hence Lasso is not stable, is presented.
