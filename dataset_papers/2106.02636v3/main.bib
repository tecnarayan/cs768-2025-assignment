Our dataset complements similar datasets in that we focus on stories about everyday activities, such as going to the movies or working in the garden, and that the questions require commonsense knowledge, or more specifically, script knowledge, to be answered. We show that our mode of data collection via crowdsourcing results in a substantial amount of such inference questions. The dataset forms the basis of a shared task on commonsense and script knowledge organized at SemEval 2018 and provides challenging test cases for the broader natural language understanding community.},

Unlike most previous work in event structure or semantic role learning, our system does not use supervised techniques, hand-built knowledge, or predefined classes of events or roles. Our unsupervised learning algorithm uses coreferring arguments in chains of verbs to learn both rich narrative event structure and argument roles. By jointly addressing both tasks, we improve on previous results in narrative/frame learning and induce rich frame-specific semantic roles.},

	abstract = {Robust and flexible event representations are important to many core areas in language understanding. Scripts were proposed early on as a way of representing sequences of events for such understanding, and has recently attracted renewed attention. However, obtaining effective representations for modeling script-like event sequences is challenging. It requires representations that can capture event-level and scenario-level semantics. We propose a new tensor-based composition method for creating event representations. The method captures more subtle semantic interactions between an event and its entities and yields representations that are effective at multiple event-related tasks. With the continuous representations, we also devise a simple schema generation method which produces better schemas compared to a prior discrete representation based method. Our analysis shows that the tensors capture distinct usages of a predicate even when there are only subtle differences in their surface realizations.},

	abstract = {Reading comprehension (RC)---in contrast to information retrieval---requires integrating information and reasoning about events, entities, and their relations across a full document. Question answering is conventionally used to assess RC ability, in both artificial agents and children learning to read. However, existing RC datasets and tasks are dominated by questions that can be solved by selecting answers using superficial information (e.g., local context similarity or global term frequency); they thus fail to test for the essential integrative aspect of RC. To encourage progress on deeper comprehension of language, we present a new dataset and set of tasks in which the reader must answer questions about stories by reading entire books or movie scripts. These tasks are designed so that successfully answering their questions requires understanding the underlying narrative rather than relying on shallow pattern matching or salience. We show that although humans solve the tasks easily, standard RC models struggle on the tasks presented here. We provide an analysis of the dataset and the challenges it presents.},

	abstract = {To understand narrative, humans draw inferences about the underlying relations between narrative events. Cognitive theories of narrative understanding define these inferences as four different types of causality, that include pairs of events A, B where A physically causes B (X drop, X break), to pairs of events where A causes emotional state B (Y saw X, Y felt fear). Previous work on learning narrative relations from text has either focused on "strict" physical causality, or has been vague about what relation is being learned. This paper learns pairs of causal events from a corpus of film scene descriptions which are action rich and tend to be told in chronological order. We show that event pairs induced using our methods are of high quality and are judged to have a stronger causal relation than event pairs from Rel-grams.},

	abstract = {Despite the success of large knowledge bases, one kind of knowledge that has not received attention so far is that of human activities. An example of such an activity is proposing to someone (to get married). For the computer, knowing that this involves two adults, often but not necessarily a woman and a man, that it often takes place in some romantic location, that it typically involves flowers or jewelry, and that it is usually followed by kissing, is a valuable asset for tasks like natural language dialog, scene understanding, or video search. This corresponds to the challenging task of acquiring semantic frames that capture human activities, their participating agents, and their typical spatio-temporal contexts. This paper presents a novel approach that taps into movie scripts and other narrative texts. We develop a pipeline for semantic parsing and knowledge distillation, to systematically compile semantically refined activity frames. The resulting knowledge base contains hundreds of thousands of activity frames, mined from about two million scenes of movies, TV series, and novels. A manual assessment study, with extensive sampling and statistical significance tests, shows that the frames and their attribute values have an accuracy of at least 80 percent. We also demonstrate the usefulness of activity knowledge by the extrinsic use case of movie scene search.},

	abstract = {Audio description (AD) provides linguistic descriptions of movies and allows visually impaired people to follow a movie along with their peers. Such descriptions are by design mainly visual and thus naturally form an interesting data source for computer vision and computational linguistics. In this work we propose a novel dataset which contains transcribed ADs, which are temporally aligned to full length movies. In addition we also collected and aligned movie scripts used in prior work and compare the two sources of descriptions. We introduce the Large Scale Movie Description Challenge (LSMDC) which contains a parallel corpus of 128,118 sentences aligned to video clips from 200 movies (around 150 h of video in total). The goal of the challenge is to automatically generate descriptions for the movie clips. First we characterize the dataset by benchmarking different approaches for generating video descriptions. Comparing ADs to scripts, we find that ADs are more visual and describe precisely what is shown rather than what should happen according to the scripts created prior to movie production. Furthermore, we present and compare the results of several teams who participated in the challenges organized in the context of two workshops at ICCV 2015 and ECCV 2016.},

	abstract = {The aim of this book is to discuss the fundamental ideas which lie behind the statistical theory of learning and generalization. It considers learning as a general problem of function estimation based on empirical data. Omitting proofs and technical details, the author concentrates on discussing the main results of learning theory and their connections to fundamental problems in statistics. These include: * the setting of learning problems based on the model of minimizing the risk functional from empirical data * a comprehensive analysis of the empirical risk minimization principle including necessary and sufficient conditions for its consistency * non-asymptotic bounds for the risk achieved using the empirical risk minimization principle * principles for controlling the generalization ability of learning machines using small sample sizes based on these bounds * the Support Vector methods that control the generalization ability when estimating function using small sample size. The second edition of the book contains three new chapters devoted to further development of the learning theory and SVM techniques. These include: * the theory of direct method of learning based on solving multidimensional integral equations for density, conditional probability, and conditional density estimation * a new inductive principle of learning. Written in a readable and concise style, the book is intended for statisticians, mathematicians, physicists, and computer scientists. Vladimir N.

Especially when an NLI dataset assumes inference is occurring based purely on the relationship between a context and a hypothesis, it follows that assessing entailment relations while ignoring the provided context is a degenerate solution. Yet, through experiments on ten distinct NLI datasets, we find that this approach, which we refer to as a hypothesis-only model, is able to significantly outperform a majority class baseline across a number of NLI datasets. Our analysis suggests that statistical irregularities may allow a model to perform NLI in some datasets beyond what should be achievable without access to the context.},
