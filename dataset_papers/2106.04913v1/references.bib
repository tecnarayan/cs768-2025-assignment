The methods in this paper lead to a unified treatment of some of Valiant's results, along with previous results on distribution-free convergence of certain pattern recognition algorithms. It is shown that the essential condition for distribution-free learnability is finiteness of the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension, a simple combinatorial parameter of the class of concepts to be learned. Using this parameter, the complexity and closure properties of learnable classes are analyzed, and the necessary and sufficient conditions are provided for feasible learnability.},

I also study the theoretical advantages of active learning over passive learning, and develop procedures for transforming passive learning algorithms into active learning algorithms with asymptotically superior label complexity. Finally, I study generalizations of active learning to more general forms of interactive statistical learning.},

abstract = {We present some extensions of Bernstein’s concentration inequality for random matrices. This inequality has become a useful and powerful tool for many problems in statistics, signal processing and theoretical computer science. The main feature of our bounds is that, unlike the majority of previous related results, they do not depend on the dimension d of the ambient space. Instead, the dimension factor is replaced by the “effective rank” associated with the underlying distribution that is bounded from above by d. In particular, this makes an extension to the infinite-dimensional setting possible. Our inequalities refine earlier results in this direction obtained by Hsu et al. (2012).}

@article{Bezdek-Covering,
	abstract = {Covering a convex body by its homothets is a classical notion in discrete geometry that has resulted in a number of interesting and long-standing problems. Swanepoel introduced the covering parameter of a convex body as a means of quantifying its covering properties. In this paper, we introduce two relatives of the covering parameter called covering index and weak covering index, which upper bound well-studied quantities like the illumination number, the illumination parameter and the covering parameter of a convex body. Intuitively, the two indices measure how well a convex body can be covered by a relatively small number of homothets having the same relatively small homothety ratio. We show that the covering index is a lower semicontinuous functional on the Banach-Mazur space of convex bodies. We further show that the affine d-cubes minimize the covering index in any dimension d, while circular disks maximize it in the plane. Furthermore, the covering index satisfies a nice compatibility with the operations of direct vector sum and vector sum. In fact, we obtain an exact formula for the covering index of a direct vector sum of convex bodies that works in infinitely many instances. This together with a minimization property can be used to determine the covering index of infinitely many convex bodies. As the name suggests, the weak covering index loses some of the important properties of the covering index. Finally, we obtain upper bounds on the covering and weak covering index.},
