  abstract = 	 {One-Shot Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is a promising method to significantly reduce search time without any separate training. It can be treated as a Network Compression problem on the architecture parameters from an over-parameterized network. However, there are two issues associated with most one-shot NAS methods. First, dependencies between a node and its predecessors and successors are often disregarded which result in improper treatment over zero operations. Second, architecture parameters pruning based on their magnitude is questionable. In this paper, we employ the classic Bayesian learning approach to alleviate these two issues by modeling architecture parameters using hierarchical automatic relevance determination (HARD) priors. Unlike other NAS methods, we train the over-parameterized network for only one epoch then update the architecture. Impressively, this enabled us to find the architecture in both proxy and proxyless tasks on CIFAR-10 within only 0.2 GPU days using a single GPU. As a byproduct, our approach can be transferred directly to compress convolutional neural networks by enforcing structural sparsity which achieves extremely sparse networks without accuracy deterioration.}

  abstract = 	 {We propose Efficient Neural Architecture Search (ENAS), a fast and inexpensive approach for automatic model design. ENAS constructs a large computational graph, where each subgraph represents a neural network architecture, hence forcing all architectures to share their parameters. A controller is trained with policy gradient to search for a subgraph that maximizes the expected reward on a validation set. Meanwhile a model corresponding to the selected subgraph is trained to minimize a canonical cross entropy loss. Sharing parameters among child models allows ENAS to deliver strong empirical performances, whilst using much fewer GPU-hours than existing automatic model design approaches, and notably, 1000x less expensive than standard Neural Architecture Search. On Penn Treebank, ENAS discovers a novel architecture that achieves a test perplexity of 56.3, on par with the existing state-of-the-art among all methods without post-training processing. On CIFAR-10, ENAS finds a novel architecture that achieves 2.89% test error, which is on par with the 2.65% test error of NASNet (Zoph et al., 2018).}

	abstract = {In multi-task learning, when the number of tasks is large, pairwise task relations exhibit sparse patterns since usually a task cannot be helpful to all of the other tasks and moreover, sparse task relations can reduce the risk of overfitting compared with the dense ones. In this paper, we focus on learning sparse task relations. Based on a regularization framework which can learn task relations among multiple tasks, we propose a SParse covAriance based mulTi-taSk (SPATS) model to learn a sparse covariance by using the ℓl regularization. The resulting objective function of the SPATS method is convex, which allows us to devise an alternating method to solve it. Moreover, some theoretical properties of the proposed model are studied. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

The present method is based on an extension of the classical stochastic gradient algorithm and a deterministic multiobjective algorithm, the Multiple Gradient Descent Algorithm (MGDA). In MGDA a descent direction common to all specified objective functions is identified through a result of convex geometry. The use of this common descent vector and the Pareto stationarity definition into the stochastic gradient algorithm makes the algorithm able to solve multiobjective problems. The mean square and almost sure convergence of this new algorithm are proven considering the classical stochastic gradient algorithm hypothesis. The algorithm efficiency is illustrated on a set of benchmarks with diverse complexity and assessed in comparison with two classical algorithms (NSGA-II, DMS) coupled with a Monte Carlo expectation estimator.},

abstract="This paper presents a novel feature selection method for classification of high dimensional data, such as those produced by microarrays. It includes a partial supervision to smoothly favor the selection of some dimensions (genes) on a new dataset to be classified. The dimensions to be favored are previously selected from similar datasets in large microarray databases, hence performing inductive transfer learning at the feature level. This technique relies on a feature selection method embedded within a regularized linear model estimation. A practical approximation of this technique reduces to linear SVM learning with iterative input rescaling. The scaling factors depend on the selected dimensions from the related datasets. The final selection may depart from those whenever necessary to optimize the classification objective. Experiments on several microarray datasets show that the proposed method both improves the selected gene lists stability, with respect to sampling variation, as well as the classification performances.",

The parameters from all models are regularised by the tensor trace norm, so that each neural network is encouraged to reuse others' parameters if possible -- this is the main motivation behind multi-task learning. In contrast to many deep multi-task learning models, we do not predefine a parameter sharing strategy by specifying which layers have tied parameters. Instead, our framework considers sharing for all shareable layers, and the sharing strategy is learned in a data-driven way.",

abstract="Though a large body of computer vision research has investigated developing generic semantic representations, efforts towards developing a similar representation for 3D has been limited. In this paper, we learn a generic 3D representation through solving a set of foundational proxy 3D tasks: object-centric camera pose estimation and wide baseline feature matching. Our method is based upon the premise that by providing supervision over a set of carefully selected foundational tasks, generalization to novel tasks and abstraction capabilities can be achieved. We empirically show that the internal representation of a multi-task ConvNet trained to solve the above core problems generalizes to novel 3D tasks (e.g., scene layout estimation, object pose estimation, surface normal estimation) without the need for fine-tuning and shows traits of abstraction abilities (e.g., cross modality pose estimation).",

  abstract = 	 {In multi-task learning, a learner is given a collection of prediction tasks and needs to solve all of them. In contrast to previous work, which required that annotated training data must be available for all tasks, we consider a new setting, in which for some tasks, potentially most of them, only unlabeled training data is provided. Consequently, to solve all tasks, information must be transferred between tasks with labels and tasks without labels. Focusing on an instance-based transfer method we analyze two variants of this setting: when the set of labeled tasks is fixed, and when it can be actively selected by the learner. We state and prove a generalization bound that covers both scenarios and derive from it an algorithm for making the choice of labeled tasks (in the active case) and for transferring information between the tasks in a principled way. We also illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithm on synthetic and real data.}
