Spike-and-slab priors are commonly used for Bayesian variable selection, due
to their interpretability and favorable statistical properties. However,
existing samplers for spike-and-slab posteriors incur prohibitive computational
costs when the number of variables is large. In this article, we propose
Scalable Spike-and-Slab ($S^3$), a scalable Gibbs sampling implementation for
high-dimensional Bayesian regression with the continuous spike-and-slab prior
of George and McCulloch (1993). For a dataset with $n$ observations and $p$
covariates, $S^3$ has order $\max\{ n^2 p_t, np \}$ computational cost at
iteration $t$ where $p_t$ never exceeds the number of covariates switching
spike-and-slab states between iterations $t$ and $t-1$ of the Markov chain.
This improves upon the order $n^2 p$ per-iteration cost of state-of-the-art
implementations as, typically, $p_t$ is substantially smaller than $p$. We
apply $S^3$ on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating orders of
magnitude speed-ups over existing exact samplers and significant gains in
inferential quality over approximate samplers with comparable cost.
