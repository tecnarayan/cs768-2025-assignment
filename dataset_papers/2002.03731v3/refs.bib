  abstract = {Many shape and image processing tools rely on computation of correspondences between geometric domains. Efﬁcient methods that stably extract “soft” matches in the presence of diverse geometric structures have proven to be valuable for shape retrieval and transfer of labels or semantic information. With these applications in mind, we present an algorithm for probabilistic correspondence that optimizes an entropy-regularized Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) objective. Built upon recent developments in numerical optimal transportation, our algorithm is compact, provably convergent, and applicable to any geometric domain expressible as a metric measure matrix. We provide comprehensive experiments illustrating the convergence and applicability of our algorithm to a variety of graphics tasks. Furthermore, we expand entropic GW correspondence to a framework for other matching problems, incorporating partial distance matrices, user guidance, shape exploration, symmetry detection, and joint analysis of more than two domains. These applications expand the scope of entropic GW correspondence to major shape analysis problems and are stable to distortion and noise.},

        abstract = {First systematic overview of Procrustean methods in one volume
Multi-disciplinary - these matching methods are used in many fields involving data analysis at research level
Contains new algorithms
Presents a unifying ANOVA framework
Procrustean methods are used to transform one set of data to represent another set of data as closely as possible. The name derives from the Greek myth where Procrustes invited passers-by in for a pleasant meal and a night's rest on a magical bed that would exactly fit any guest. He then either stretched the guest on the rack or cut off their legs to make them fit perfectly into the bed. Theseus turned the tables on Procrustes, fatally adjusting him to fit his own bed.
This text, the first monograph on Procrustes methods, unifies several strands in the literature and contains much new material. It focuses on matching two or more configurations by using orthogonal, projection and oblique axes transformations. Group-average summaries play an important part and links with other group-average methods are discussed. 
This is the latest in the well-established and authoritative Oxford Statistical Science Series, which includes texts and monographs covering many topics of current research interest in pure and applied statistics. Each title has an original slant even if the material included is not specifically original. The authors are leading researchers and the topics covered will be of interest to all professional statisticians, whether they be in industry, government department or research institute.

volume="11",
number="1",
pages="117--127",
abstract="This paper addresses itself to the maximization of a convex quadratic function subject to linear constraints. We first prove the equivalence of this problem to the associated bilinear program. Next we apply the theory of bilinear programming developed in [9] to compute a local maximum and to generate a cutting plane which eliminates a region containing that local maximum. Then we develop an iterative procedure to improve a given cut by exploiting the symmetric structure of the bilinear program. This procedure either generates a point which is strictly better than the best local maximum found, or generates a cut which is deeper (usually much deeper) than Tui's cut. Finally the results of numerical experiments on small problems are reported.",
