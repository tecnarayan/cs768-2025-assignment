abstract = {Recommender systems are incremental in nature. Recent progresses in incremental recommendation rely on capturing the temporal dynamics of users/items from temporal interaction graphs, so that their user/item embeddings can evolve together with the graph structures. However, these methods are faced with two key challenges: 1) model training and/or updating are time-consuming and 2) new users/items cannot be effectively handled. To this end, we propose the fast incremental recommendation (FIRE) method from a graph signal processing perspective. FIRE is non-parametric which does not suffer from the time-consuming back-propagations as in previous learning-based methods, significantly improving the efficiency of model updating. In addition, we encode user/item temporal information and side information by designing new graph filters in FIRE, which can capture the temporal dynamics of users/items and address the cold-start issue for new users/items, respectively. Experimental studies on four popular datasets demonstrate that FIRE can improve the accuracy by a large margin and improve the model updating efficiency by at least 3X compared with the state-of-the-art incremental recommendation algorithms. The Code is available at https://github.com/Yaveng/FIRE.},

abstract = {Graph neural networks (GNN) recently achieved huge success in collaborative filtering (CF) due to the useful graph structure information. However, users will continuously interact with items, which causes the user-item interaction graphs to change over time and well-trained GNN models to be out-of-date soon. Naive solutions such as periodic retraining lose important temporal information and are computationally expensive. Recent works that leverage recurrent neural networks to keep GNN up-to-date may suffer from the "catastrophic forgetting'' issue, and experience a cold start with new users and items. To this end, we propose the incremental graph convolutional network (IGCN) --- a pure graph convolutional network (GCN) based method to update GNN models when new user-item interactions are available. IGCN consists of two main components: 1) a historical feature generation layer, which generates the initial user/item embedding via model agnostic meta-learning and ensures good initial states and fast model adaptation; 2) a temporal feature learning layer, which first aggregates the features from local neighborhood to update the embedding of each user/item within each subgraph via graph convolutional network and then fuses the user/item embeddings from last subgraph and current subgraph via incremental temporal convolutional network. Experimental studies on real-world datasets show that IGCN can outperform state-of-the-art CF algorithms in sequential recommendation tasks.},
