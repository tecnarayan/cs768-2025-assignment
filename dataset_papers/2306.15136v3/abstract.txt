Trajectory prediction plays a vital role in the performance of autonomous
driving systems, and prediction accuracy, such as average displacement error
(ADE) or final displacement error (FDE), is widely used as a performance
metric. However, a significant disparity exists between the accuracy of
predictors on fixed datasets and driving performance when the predictors are
used downstream for vehicle control, because of a dynamics gap. In the real
world, the prediction algorithm influences the behavior of the ego vehicle,
which, in turn, influences the behaviors of other vehicles nearby. This
interaction results in predictor-specific dynamics that directly impacts
prediction results. In fixed datasets, since other vehicles' responses are
predetermined, this interaction effect is lost, leading to a significant
dynamics gap. This paper studies the overlooked significance of this dynamics
gap. We also examine several other factors contributing to the disparity
between prediction performance and driving performance. The findings highlight
the trade-off between the predictor's computational efficiency and prediction
accuracy in determining real-world driving performance. In summary, an
interactive, task-driven evaluation protocol for trajectory prediction is
crucial to capture its effectiveness for autonomous driving. Source code along
with experimental settings is available online.
