%  This is an example BibLaTeX data file.
%
%  I like to order the entries by author, and within author by date.
%  If, for example, I later added a second 1994 publication for Goossens,
%  I would give it the key, "goossens1994b".
%
%  From http://isbn.org/about_ISBN_standard
%      For more than thirty years, ISBNs were 10 digits long.
%      On January 1, 2007 the ISBN system switched to a 13-digit
%      format.  Now all ISBNs are 13-digits long.
%
%  The apa7-<number> references are from the _Publication Manual
%  of the American Psychological Association_, 7th edition,
%  pages 317--352.

@article{HajekWuXuSDP15,
	Abstract = {Resolving a conjecture of Abbe, Bandeira and Hall, the authors have recently shown that the semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation of the maximum likelihood estimator achieves the sharp threshold for exactly recovering the community structure under the binary stochastic block model of two equal-sized clusters. The same was shown for the case of a single cluster and outliers. Extending the proof techniques, in this paper it is shown that SDP relaxations also achieve the sharp recovery threshold in the following cases: (1) Binary stochastic block model with two clusters of sizes proportional to network size but not necessarily equal; (2) Stochastic block model with a fixed number of equal-sized clusters; (3) Binary censored block model with the background graph being Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi. Furthermore, a sufficient condition is given for an SDP procedure to achieve exact recovery for the general case of a fixed number of clusters plus outliers. These results demonstrate the versatility of SDP relaxation as a simple, general purpose, computationally feasible methodology for community detection.},

abstract = {This paper describes a fully automatic pipeline for finding an intrinsic map between two non-isometric, genus zero surfaces. Our approach is based on the observation that efficient methods exist to search for nearly isometric maps (e.g., M\"{o}bius Voting or Heat Kernel Maps), but no single solution found with these methods provides low-distortion everywhere for pairs of surfaces differing by large deformations. To address this problem, we suggest using a weighted combination of these maps to produce a "blended map." This approach enables algorithms that leverage efficient search procedures, yet can provide the flexibility to handle large deformations.The main challenges of this approach lie in finding a set of candidate maps {mi} and their associated blending weights {bi(p)} for every point p on the surface. We address these challenges specifically for conformal maps by making the following contributions. First, we provide a way to blend maps, defining the image of p as the weighted geodesic centroid of mi(p). Second, we provide a definition for smooth blending weights at every point p that are proportional to the area preservation of mi at p. Third, we solve a global optimization problem that selects candidate maps based both on their area preservation and consistency with other selected maps. During experiments with these methods, we find that our algorithm produces blended maps that align semantic features better than alternative approaches over a variety of data sets.},

This model is limited by the assumption that all nodes in the same community are statistically equivalent and have equal expected degrees. The degree-corrected stochastic block model (DCSBM) is a natural extension of SBM that allows for degree heterogeneity within communities. This paper proposes a convexified modularity maximization approach for estimating the hidden communities under DCSBM. Our approach is based on a convex programming relaxation of the classical (generalized) modularity maximization formulation, followed by a novel doubly-weighted},

	Abstract = {A non-backtracking walk on a graph is a directed path such that no edge is the inverse of its preceding edge. The non-backtracking matrix of a graph is indexed by its directed edges and can be used to count non-backtracking walks of a given length. It has been used recently in the context of community detection and has appeared previously in connection with the Ihara zeta function and in some generalizations of Ramanujan graphs. In this work, we study the largest eigenvalues of the non-backtracking matrix of the Erdos-Renyi random graph and of the Stochastic Block Model in the regime where the number of edges is proportional to the number of vertices. Our results confirm the "spectral redemption" conjecture that community detection can be made on the basis of the leading eigenvectors above the feasibility threshold.},
