Crowdsourcing has gained immense popularity in machine learning applications
for obtaining large amounts of labeled data. Crowdsourcing is cheap and fast,
but suffers from the problem of low-quality data. To address this fundamental
challenge in crowdsourcing, we propose a simple payment mechanism to
incentivize workers to answer only the questions that they are sure of and skip
the rest. We show that surprisingly, under a mild and natural "no-free-lunch"
requirement, this mechanism is the one and only incentive-compatible payment
mechanism possible. We also show that among all possible incentive-compatible
mechanisms (that may or may not satisfy no-free-lunch), our mechanism makes the
smallest possible payment to spammers. We further extend our results to a more
general setting in which workers are required to provide a quantized confidence
for each question. Interestingly, this unique mechanism takes a
"multiplicative" form. The simplicity of the mechanism is an added benefit. In
preliminary experiments involving over 900 worker-task pairs, we observe a
significant drop in the error rates under this unique mechanism for the same or
lower monetary expenditure.
