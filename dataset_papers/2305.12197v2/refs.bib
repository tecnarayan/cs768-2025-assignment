	abstract = {A branch and bound algorithm for the acyclic subgraph problem (feedback are set problem) is described. The branching scheme lexicographically enumerates all permutations, skipping initial segments known by some easy tests not to have any optimal completion. A lower bound for the number of feedback arcs is given by the size of any collection of disjoint cycles. We propose a heuristic algorithm to find a large collection. The size of the problems our branch and bound algorithm can solve varies from 25 to 34 nodes, depending on the nature of the problem.},

  abstract={In this paper, we discuss the use of mixed integer rounding (MIR) inequalities to solve mixed integer programs. MIR inequalities are essentially Gomory mixed integer cuts. However, as we wish to use problem structure, we insist that MIR inequalities be generated from constraints or simple aggregations of constraints of the original problem. This idea is motivated by the observation that several strong valid inequalities based on specific problem structure can be derived as MIR inequalities.Here we present and test a separation routine for such MIR inequalities that includes a heuristic row aggregation procedure to generate a single knapsack plus continuous variables constraint, complementation of variables, and finally the generation of an MIR inequality. Inserted in a branch-and-cut system, the results suggest that such a routine is a useful additional tool for tackling a variety of mixed integer programming problems.},

Lifting is usually applied sequentially, that is, variables in a set are lifted one after the other. This may be computationally unattractive since it involves the solution of an optimization problem to compute a lifting coefficient for each variable. To relieve this computational burden, we study sequence independent lifting, which only involves the solution of one optimization problem. We show that if a certain lifting function is superadditive, then the lifting coefficients are independent of the lifting sequence. We introduce the idea of valid superadditive lifting functions to obtain good aproximations to maximum lifting. We apply these results to strengthen Balas' lifting theorem for cover inequalities and to produce lifted flow cover inequalities for a single node flow problem.},

An additional strengthening step suggested by Balas and Jeroslow is then applied. We report our computational experience with a preliminary version of the algorithm.

We show that {\{}0, 1/2{\}}-SEP can be solved in polynomial time for a convenient relaxation of the systemAx<-b.

	abstract = {In many practical applications, the task is to optimize a non-linear objective function over the vertices of a well-studied polytope as, e.g., the matching polytope or the travelling salesman polytope (TSP). Prominent examples are the quadratic assignment problem and the quadratic knapsack problem; further applications occur in various areas such as production planning or automatic graph drawing. In order to apply branch-and-cut methods for the exact solution of such problems, the objective function has to be linearized. However, the standard linearization usually leads to very weak relaxations. On the other hand, problem-specific polyhedral studies are often time-consuming. Our goal is the design of general separation routines that can replace detailed polyhedral studies of the resulting polytope and that can be used as a black box. As unconstrained binary quadratic optimization is equivalent to the maximum-cut problem, knowledge about cut polytopes can be used in our setting. Other separation routines are inspired by the local cuts that have been developed by Applegate, Bixby, Chv{\'a}tal and Cook for faster solution of large-scale traveling salesman instances. Finally, we apply quadratic reformulations of the linear constraints as proposed by Helmberg, Rendl and Weismantel for the quadratic knapsack problem. By extensive experiments, we show that a suitable combination of these methods leads to a drastic speedup in the solution of constrained quadratic 0--1 problems. We also discuss possible generalizations of these methods to arbitrary non-linear objective functions.},

Two representations are given for the convex hull of feasible points, each of which provides linear programming equivalents of the disjunctive program. The first one involves a number of new variables proportional to the number of terms in the disjunctive normal form of the logical constraints; the second one involves only the original variables and the facets of the convex hull. Among other results, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for an inequality to define a facet of the convex hull of feasible points. For the class of disjunctive programs that we call facial, we establish a property which makes it possible to obtain the convex hull of points satisfying n disjunctions, in a sequence of n steps, where each step generates the convex hull of points satisfying one disjunction only.}

	abstract = {The polyhedron defined by all the split cuts obtainable directly (i.e. without iterated cut generation) from the LP-relaxation P of a mixed integer program (MIP) is termed the (elementary, or rank 1) split closure of P. This paper deals with the problem of optimizing over the elementary split closure. This is accomplished by repeatedly solving the following separation problem: given a fractional point, say x, find a rank-1 split cut violated by x or show that none exists. Following Caprara and Letchford {$[$}17{$]$}, we formulate this separation problem as a nonlinear mixed integer program that can be treated as a parametric mixed integer linear program (PMILP) with a single parameter in the objective function and the right hand side. We develop an algorithmic framework to deal with the resulting PMILP by creating and maintaining a dynamically updated grid of parameter values, and use the corresponding mixed integer programs to generate rank 1 split cuts. Our approach was implemented in the COIN-OR framework using CPLEX 9.0 as a general purpose MIP solver. We report our computational results on well-known benchmark instances from MIPLIB 3.0 and several classes of structured integer and mixed integer problems. Our computational results show that rank-1 split cuts close more than 98{\%} of the duality gap on 15 out of 41 mixed integer instances from MIPLIB 3.0. More than 75{\%} of the duality gap can be closed on an additional 10 instances. The average gap closed over all 41 instances is 72.78{\%}. In the pure integer case, rank-1 split cuts close more than 75{\%} of the duality gap on 13 out of 24 instances from MIPLIB 3.0. On average, rank 1 split cuts close about 72{\%} of the duality gap on these 24 instances. We also report results on several classes of structured problems: capacitated versions of warehouse location, single-source facility location, p-median, fixed charge network flow, multi-commodity network design with splittable and unsplittable flows, and lot sizing. The fraction of the integrality gap closed varies for these problem classes between 100 and 67{\%}. We also gathered statistics on the average coefficient size (absolute value) of the disjunctions generated. They turn out to be surprisingly small.},

	abstract = {Cutting planes have been used with great success for solving mixed integer programs. In recent decades, many contributions have led to successive improvements in branch-and-cut methods which incorporate cutting planes in branch and bound algorithm. Using advances that have taken place over the years on 0--1 knapsack problem, we investigate an efficient approach for 0--1 programs with knapsack constraints as local structure. Our approach is based on an efficient implementation of knapsack separation problem which consists of the four phases: preprocessing, row generation, controlling numerical errors and sequential lifting. This approach can be used independently to improve formulations with cutting planes generated or incorporated in branch and cut to solve a problem. We show that this approach allows us to efficiently solve large-scale instances of generalized assignment problem, multilevel generalized assignment problem, capacitated {\$}{\$}p{\$}{\$}-median problem and capacitated network location problem to optimality.},

These algorithms recursively partition the search space to find an optimal solution. To keep the tree small, it is crucial to carefully decide, when expanding a tree node, which variable to branch on at that node to partition the remaining space. Many partitioning techniques have been proposed, but no theory describes which is optimal. We show how to use machine learning to determine an optimal weighting of any set of partitioning procedures for the instance distribution at hand using samples. Via theory and experiments, we show that learning to branch is both practical and hugely beneficial.}

Moreover, we improve for the first time over expert-designed branching rules implemented in a state-of-the-art solver on large problems.

As Integer Programs (IPs) model many provably hard to solve problems, modern IP solvers rely on heuristics. These heuristics are often human-designed, and tuned over time using experience and data. The goal of this work is to show that the performance of those solvers can be greatly enhanced using reinforcement learning (RL). In particular, we investigate a specific methodology for solving IPs, known as the Cutting Plane Method. This method is employed as a subroutine by all modern IP solvers. We present a deep RL formulation, network architecture, and algorithms for intelligent adaptive selection of cutting planes (aka cuts). Across a wide range of IP tasks, we show that our trained RL agent significantly outperforms human-designed heuristics, and effectively generalizes to larger instances and across IP problem classes. The trained agent is also demonstrated to benefit the popular downstream application of cutting plane methods in Branch-and-Cut algorithm, which is the backbone of state-of-the-art commercial IP solvers.}

The performance of automatically learned heuristics on routing problems has been steadily improving in recent years, but approaches based purely on machine learning are still outperformed by state-of-the-art optimization methods. To close this performance gap, we propose a novel large neighborhood search (LNS) framework for vehicle routing that integrates learned heuristics for generating new solutions. The learning mechanism is based on a deep neural network with an attention mechanism and has been especially designed to be integrated into an LNS search setting. We evaluate our approach on the capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP), the split delivery vehicle routing problem (SDVRP), and the capacitated team orienteering problem (CTOP). We show that the NLNS approach is able to outperform a handcrafted LNS on the CVRP and SDVRP and match the performance of a standard LNS on the CTOP. NLNS is thus able to quickly and effectively learn high performance heuristics to maneuver through the search space of difficult routing problems, coming close to the performance of state-of-the-art optimization approaches.}

abstract = {The design of good heuristics or approximation algorithms for NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems often requires significant specialized knowledge and trial-and-error. Can we automate this challenging, tedious process, and learn the algorithms instead? In many real-world applications, it is typically the case that the same optimization problem is solved again and again on a regular basis, maintaining the same problem structure but differing in the data. This provides an opportunity for learning heuristic algorithms that exploit the structure of such recurring problems. In this paper, we propose a unique combination of reinforcement learning and graph embedding to address this challenge. The learned greedy policy behaves like a meta-algorithm that incrementally constructs a solution, and the action is determined by the output of a graph embedding network capturing the current state of the solution. We show that our framework can be applied to a diverse range of optimization problems over graphs, and learns effective algorithms for the Minimum Vertex Cover, Maximum Cut and Traveling Salesman problems.},
