abstract = {We study the sample complexity of learning revenue-optimal multi-item auctions. We obtain the first set of positive results that go beyond the standard but unrealistic setting of item-independence. In particular, we consider settings where bidders' valuations are drawn from correlated distributions that can be captured by Markov Random Fields or Bayesian Networks -- two of the most prominent graphical models. We establish parametrized sample complexity bounds for learning an up-to-ε optimal mechanism in both models, which scale polynomially in the size of the model, i.e. the number of items and bidders, and only exponential in the natural complexity measure of the model, namely either the largest in-degree (for Bayesian Networks) or the size of the largest hyper-edge (for Markov Random Fields).We obtain our learnability results through a novel and modular framework that involves first proving a robustness theorem. We show that, given only "approximate distributions" for bidder valuations, we can learn a mechanism whose revenue is nearly optimal simultaneously for all "true distributions" that are close to the ones we were given in Prokhorov distance. Thus, to learn a good mechanism, it suffices to learn approximate distributions. When item values are independent, learning in Prokhorov distance is immediate, hence our framework directly implies the main result of Gonczarowski and Weinberg[36]. When item values are sampled from more general graphical models, we combine our robustness theorem with novel sample complexity results for learning Markov Random Fields or Bayesian Networks in Prokhorov distance, which may be of independent interest. Finally, in the single-item case, our robustness result can be strengthened to hold under an even weaker distribution distance, the Levy distance.},

abstract = {Machine learning has developed a variety of tools for learning and representing high-dimensional distributions with structure. Recent years have also seen big advances in designing multi-item mechanisms. Akin to overfitting, however, these mechanisms can be extremely sensitive to the Bayesian prior that they target, which becomes problematic when that prior is only approximately known. At the same time, even if access to the exact Bayesian prior is given, it is known that optimal or even approximately optimal multi-item mechanisms run into sample, computational, representation and communication intractability barriers.We consider a natural class of multi-item mechanism design problems with very large numbers of items, but where the bidders' value distributions can be well-approximated by a topic model akin to those used in recommendation systems with very large numbers of possible recommendations. We propose a mechanism design framework for this setting, building on a recent robustification framework by Brustle et al., which disentangles the statistical challenge of estimating a multi-dimensional prior from the task of designing a good mechanism for it, and robustifies the performance of the latter against the estimation error of the former. We provide an extension of this framework appropriate for our setting, which allows us to exploit the expressive power of topic models to reduce the effective dimensionality of the mechanism design problem and remove the dependence of its computational, communication and representation complexity on the number of items.},
