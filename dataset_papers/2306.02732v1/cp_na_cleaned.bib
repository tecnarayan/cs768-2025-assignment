High-performance concrete is a highly complex material, which makes modeling its behavior a very difficult task. This paper is aimed at demonstrating the possibilities of adapting artificial neural networks (ANN) to predict the compressive strength of high-performance concrete. A set of trial batches of HPC was produced in the laboratory and demonstrated satisfactory experimental results. This study led to the following conclusions: (1) a strength model based on ANN is more accurate than a model based on regression analysis; and (2) it is convenient and easy to use ANN models for numerical experiments to review the effects of the proportions of each variable on the concrete mix.},
