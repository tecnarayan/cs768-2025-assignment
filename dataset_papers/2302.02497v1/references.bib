abstract="We obtain exponential concentration inequalities for sub-additive functions of independent random variables under weak conditions on the increments of those functions, like the existence of exponential moments for these increments. As a consequence of these general inequalities, we obtain refinements of Talagrand's inequality for empirical processes and new bounds for randomized processes associated to unbounded random variables. These results are obtained by further developing the entropy method introduced by Ledoux.",

  abstract = 	 {We propose an estimator for the mean of a random vector in $\mathbb{R}^d$ that can be computed in time $O(n^{3.5}+n^2d)$ for $n$ i.i.d.&nbsp;samples and that has error bounds matching the sub-Gaussian case. The only assumptions we make about the data distribution are that it has finite mean and covariance; in particular, we make no assumptions about higher-order moments. Like the polynomial time estimator introduced by Hopkins (2018), which is based on the sum-of-squares hierarchy, our estimator achieves optimal statistical efficiency in this challenging setting, but it has a significantly faster runtime and a simpler analysis.}
