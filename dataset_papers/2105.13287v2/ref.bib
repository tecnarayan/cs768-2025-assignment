  abstract = 	 {Clustering large-scale networks is a central topic in unsupervised learning with many applications in machine learning and data mining. A classic approach to cluster a network is to identify regions of high edge density, which in the literature is captured by two fundamental problems: the densest subgraph and the $k$-core decomposition problems. We design massively parallel computation (MPC) algorithms for these problems that are considerably faster than prior work. In the case of $k$-core decomposition, our work improves exponentially on the algorithm provided by Esfandiari et al. (ICML’18). Compared to the prior work on densest subgraph presented by Bahmani et al. (VLDB’12, ’14), our result requires quadratically fewer MPC rounds. We complement our analysis with an experimental scalability analysis of our techniques.}

Since network data is commonly noisy and incomplete, a fundamental issue is to understand how robust the core decomposition is to noise. Further, in many settings, such as online social media networks, usually only a sample of the network is available. Therefore, a related question is: How robust is the top core set under such sampling?",

In this paper we present new algorithms for finding the densest subgraph in the streaming model. For any ε > 0, our algorithms make O(log1+ε n) passes over the input and find a subgraph whose density is guaranteed to be within a factor 2(1 + ε) of the optimum. Our algorithms are also easily parallelizable and we illustrate this by realizing them in the MapReduce model. In addition we perform extensive experimental evaluation on massive real-world graphs showing the performance and scalability of our algorithms in practice.},
