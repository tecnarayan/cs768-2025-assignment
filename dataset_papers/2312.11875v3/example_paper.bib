abstract = {

Subspace techniques such as Krylov subspace methods have been well
known and extensively used in numerical linear algebra. They are also ubiquitous and
becoming indispensable tools in nonlinear optimization due to their ability to handle large scale problems. There are generally two types of principals: i) the decision
variable is updated in a lower dimensional subspace; ii) the objective function or constraints are approximated in a certain smaller subspace of their domain. The key ingredients are the constructions of suitable subspaces and subproblems according to the
specific structures of the variables and functions such that either the exact or inexact
solutions of subproblems are readily available and the corresponding computational
cost is significantly reduced. A few relevant techniques include but not limited to direct combinations, block coordinate descent, active sets, limited-memory, Anderson
acceleration, subspace correction, sampling and sketching. This paper gives a comprehensive survey on the subspace methods and their recipes in unconstrained and
constrained optimization, nonlinear least squares problem, sparse and low rank optimization, linear and nonlinear eigenvalue computation, semidefinite programming,
stochastic optimization and etc. In order to provide helpful guidelines, we emphasize on high level concepts for the development and implementation of practical algorithms from the subspace framework.

We show that with small-to-medium training data, applying BitFit on pre-trained BERT models is competitive with (and sometimes better than) fine-tuning the entire model. For larger data, the method is competitive with other sparse fine-tuning methods. Besides their practical utility, these findings are relevant for the question of understanding the commonly-used process of finetuning: they support the hypothesis that finetuning is mainly about exposing knowledge induced by language-modeling training, rather than learning new task-specific linguistic knowledge.",

    abstract = "{We present a new algorithm for finding low-complexity neural networks with high generalization capability. The algorithm searches for a “flat” minimum of the error function. A flat minimum is a large connected region in weight space where the error remains approximately constant. An MDL-based, Bayesian argument suggests that flat minima correspond to “simple” networks and low expected overfitting. The argument is based on a Gibbs algorithm variant and a novel way of splitting generalization error into underfitting and overfitting error. Unlike many previous approaches, ours does not require gaussian assumptions and does not depend on a “good” weight prior. Instead we have a prior over input output functions, thus taking into account net architecture and training set. Although our algorithm requires the computation of second-order derivatives, it has backpropagation's order of complexity. Automatically, it effectively prunes units, weights, and input lines. Various experiments with feedforward and recurrent nets are described. In an application to stock market prediction, flat minimum search outperforms conventional backprop, weight decay, and “optimal brain surgeon/optimal brain damage.”}",
