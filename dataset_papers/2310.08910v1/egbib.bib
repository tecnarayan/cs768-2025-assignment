% Adaptive weighing

% Multi-Task Learning Using Uncertainty to Weigh Losses for Scene Geometry and Semantics: Losses are inversely scaled by variance

%GradNorm
% define coeff ri = (loss at time i - loss at time 0) normalized across all tasks losses ~ normalized training speed
% define Gi = target gradient norm = average gradient norm  rescaled by multiplying by ri
% finally, define GradNorm regularization loss as a L1 loss between the target Gi and the actual gradient norm

% Cost: need to compute Loss with resepct to task separatel Gradnorm is only applied in the last layer due to ocmpute cost
% Essentially they claim to be better than GridSearch wich doesn't seem to be the case in later studies so maybe vey specific to one learning rate/study

%PCGrad
% Compute gradients wrt each task, and detect which gradients are interfering with each other (= cosine of the angle < 0, i.e. angle obtus). Then project on on the orthogonal plane of the other to remove the confliciting direction. If too much conflict, are we not just destorying information
% if there are multiple conflicting gradients, the projection is done against all of them, in random order (quadratic loop), iteratively
% teory = analyze the PCGrad in the convex setting, mouais
% cost = same but implementedmore efficient; order bartch per task and only do projection once all tasks are mt. One update every T forward pass

%%IMTL
% note: they also hae a nice reated section to check previous work
% IMTL: Two scalings. one of the task private parameters where the losses are rescaled t have roughly equal magnitudes
% second scalin is on the task shared parameters where they use projections
% so they use both "gradient" balance and "loss" balance according to them
% in essence, their scaling method is close-ish to GradNorm. And on top of that they also have the loss rescaling balance for the shared parameters

%% GradDrop
% basically it is taking the opposite direction of Grad Surgery and saying that some noise is better than removing all conflicting directions.

% gradient and loss methods can be combined as in ITML but often not due to cost
