  abstract = {We present a new dataset with the goal of advancing the state-of-the-art in object recognition by placing the question of object recognition in the context of the broader question of scene understanding. This is achieved by gathering images of complex everyday scenes containing common objects in their natural context. Objects are labeled using per-instance segmentations to aid in precise object localization. Our dataset contains photos of 91 objects types that would be easily recognizable by a 4 year old. With a total of 2.5 million labeled instances in 328k images, the creation of our dataset drew upon extensive crowd worker involvement via novel user interfaces for category detection, instance spotting and instance segmentation. We present a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset in comparison to PASCAL, ImageNet, and SUN. Finally, we provide baseline performance analysis for bounding box and segmentation detection results using a Deformable Parts Model.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) systems have increasingly achieved expert-level performance in medical imaging applications. However, there is growing concern that such AI systems may reflect and amplify human bias, and reduce the quality of their performance in historically under-served populations such as female patients, Black patients, or patients of low socioeconomic status. Such biases are especially troubling in the context of underdiagnosis, whereby the AI algorithm would inaccurately label an individual with a disease as healthy, potentially delaying access to care. Here, we examine algorithmic underdiagnosis in chest X-ray pathology classification across three large chest X-ray datasets, as well as one multi-source dataset. We find that classifiers produced using state-of-the-art computer vision techniques consistently and selectively underdiagnosed under-served patient populations and that the underdiagnosis rate was higher for intersectional under-served subpopulations, for example, Hispanic female patients. Deployment of AI systems using medical imaging for disease diagnosis with such biases risks exacerbation of existing care biases and can potentially lead to unequal access to medical treatment, thereby raising ethical concerns for the use of these models in the clinic.},

  abstract = {Language is increasingly being used to de-fine rich visual recognition problems with supporting image collections sourced from the web. Structured prediction models are used in these tasks to take advantage of correlations between co-occurring labels and visual input but risk inadvertently encoding social biases found in web corpora. In this work, we study data and models associated with multilabel object classification and visual semantic role labeling. We find that (a) datasets for these tasks contain significant gender bias and (b) models trained on these datasets further amplify existing bias. For example, the activity cooking is over 33\% more likely to involve females than males in a training set, and a trained model further amplifies the disparity to 68\% at test time. We propose to inject corpus-level constraints for calibrating existing structured prediction models and design an algorithm based on Lagrangian relaxation for collective inference. Our method results in almost no performance loss for the underlying recognition task but decreases the magnitude of bias amplification by 47.5\% and 40.5\% for multilabel classification and visual semantic role labeling, respectively。},

abstract="In the field of Computer Vision (CV), the degree to which two objects, e.g. two classes, share a common conceptual meaning, known as semantic similarity, is closely linked to the visual resemblance of their physical appearances in the data: entities with higher semantic similarity, typically exhibit greater visual resemblance than entities with lower semantic similarity. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) employed for classification exploit this visual similarity, incorporating it into the network's representations (e.g., neurons), resulting in the functional similarity between the learned representations of visually akin classes, often manifesting in correlated activation patterns. However, such functional similarities can also emerge from spurious correlations --- undesired auxiliary features that are shared between classes, such as backgrounds or specific artifacts. In this work, we present the Function-Semantic Contrast Analysis (FSCA) method, which identifies potential unintended correlations between network representations by examining the contrast between the functional distance of representations and the knowledge-based semantic distance between the concepts these representations were trained to recognize. While natural discrepancy is expected, our results indicate that these differences often originate from harmful spurious correlations in the data. We validate our approach by examining the presence of spurious correlations in widely-used CV architectures, demonstrating that FSCA offers a scalable solution for discovering previously undiscovered biases, that reduces the need for human supervision and is applicable across various Image Classification problems.",
