While retaining the key features of the 6th edition, the new edition provides a more careful balance of explanation, theory, and examples. Taking a problem-solving-skills approach to incorporating theorems with applications, the book's improved focus will help students succeed throughout their academic careers and well into their professions. Some notable enhancements include more refined and focused content in important topics, improved organization, updated notations, extensive explanations and intuitive exercise sets, a wider range of problem solutions, improvement in the placement, and a wider range of difficulty of exercises"--Publisher's description},

If a Fourier method is applied to a non-periodic problem, it inevitably induces the so-called Gibbs phenomenon, and reduces the global convergence rate to O(N-1) (cf. Gottlieb and Orszag (1977)). Consequently, one should not apply a Fourier method to problems with non-periodic boundary conditions. Instead, one should use orthogonal polynomials which are eigenfunctions of some singular Sturm-Liouville problems. The commonly used orthogonal polynomials include the Legendre, Chebyshev, Hermite and Laguerre polynomials.},
