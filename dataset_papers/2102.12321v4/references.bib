  abstract = "This paper reports a habituation study indicating that
              12-month-old infants can take the ``intentional stance'' in
              interpreting the goal-directed spatial behavior of a rational
              agent. First, we examine previous empirical claims suggesting
              that the ability to attribute intentions to others emerges during
              the second half of the first year. It is argued that neither the
              perceptual evidence (concerning the early ability to discriminate
              agents), nor the behavioral data (indicating the use of
              communicative gestures for instrumental purposes) are sufficient
              to support such claims about the early appearance of a theory of
              mind, as there are alternative explanations for these phenomena
              in terms of simpler psychological processes. It is then suggested
              that to show that an infant indeed attributes an intention to
              interpret the goal-directed behavior of a rational agent, one
              needs to demonstrate that the baby can generate an expectation
              about the most rational future means action that the agent will
              perform in a new situation to achieve its goal. We then describe
              a visual habituation study that meets this requirement. The
              results demonstrate that based on the equifinal structure of an
              agent's spatial behavior, 12-month-old infants can identify the
              agent's goal and interpret its actions causally in relation to
              it. Furthermore, our study indicates that infants of this age are
              able to evaluate the rationality of the agent's goal-directed
              actions, which is a necessary requirement for applying the
              intentional stance. In closing, we discuss some of the
              theoretical and methodological implications of our study.",

              inferences to unobserved states of affairs (such as unseen goal
              states or occluded obstacles). We measured looking times to
              assess violation of infants' expectations upon perceiving either
              a change in the actions of computer-animated figures or in the
              context of such actions. The first experiment tested whether
              infants would attribute a goal to an action that they had not
              seen completed. The second experiment tested whether infants
              would infer from an observed action the presence of an occluded
              object that functions as an obstacle. The looking time patterns
              of 12-month-olds indicated that they were able to make both types
              of inferences, while 9-month-olds failed in both tasks. These
              results demonstrate that, by the end of the first year of life,
              infants use the principle of rational action not only for the
              interpretation and prediction of goal-directed actions, but also
              for making productive inferences about unseen aspects of their
              context. We discuss the underlying mechanisms that may be
              involved in the developmental change from 9 to 12 months of age
              in the ability to infer hypothetical (unseen) states of affairs

@ARTICLE{Woodward1998,
  title    = "Infants selectively encode the goal object of an actor's reach",
  author   = "Woodward, Amanda L",
  abstract = "Research with young children has shown that, like adults, they
              focus selectively on the aspects of an actor's behavior that are
              relevant to his or her underlying intentions. The current studies
              used the visual habituation paradigm to ask whether infants would
              similarly attend to those aspects of an action that are related
              to the actor's goals. Infants saw an actor reach for and grasp
              one of two toys sitting side by side on a curtained stage. After
              habituation, the positions of the toys were switched and babies
              saw test events in which there was a change in either the path of
              motion taken by the actor's arm or the object that was grasped by
              the actor. In the first study, 9-month-old infants looked longer
              when the actor grasped a new toy than when she moved through a
              new path. Nine-month-olds who saw an inanimate object of
              approximately the same dimensions as the actor's arm touch the
              toy did not show this pattern in test. In the second study,
              5-month-old infants showed similar, though weaker, patterns. A
              third study provided evidence that the findings for the events
              involving a person were not due to perceptual changes in the
              objects caused by occlusion by the hand. A fourth study
              replicated the 9 month results for a human grasp at 6 months, and
              revealed that these effects did not emerge when infants saw an
              inanimate object with digits that moved to grasp the toy. Taken
              together, these findings indicate that young infants distinguish
              in their reasoning about human action and object motion, and that
              by 6 months infants encode the actions of other people in ways
              that are consistent with more mature understandings of
              goal-directed action.",

              in understanding the origins of this ability in infancy. This
