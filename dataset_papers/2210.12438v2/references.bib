abstract="The last decade lead to an unbelievable growth of the importance of social media. Due to the huge amounts of documents appearing in social media, there is an enormous need for the automatic analysis of such documents. In this work, we focus on the analysis of documents appearing in blogs. We present a proof-of-concept industrial application, developed in cooperation with Capgemini Magyarorsz{\'a}g Kft. The most interesting component of this software prototype allows to predict the number of feedbacks that a blog document is expected to receive. For the prediction, we used various predictions algorithms in our experiments. For these experiments, we crawled blog documents from the internet. As an additional contribution, we published our dataset in order to motivate research in this field of growing interest.",

They are downloaded hundreds of thousands of times each year, reflecting their use in popular press programming books, traditional and online courses, and software. These datasets are a product of member activity in the MovieLens movie recommendation system, an active research platform that has hosted many experiments since its launch in 1997. This article documents the history of MovieLens and the MovieLens datasets. We include a discussion of lessons learned from running a long-standing, live research platform from the perspective of a research organization.
