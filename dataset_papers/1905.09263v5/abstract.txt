Neural network based end-to-end text to speech (TTS) has significantly
improved the quality of synthesized speech. Prominent methods (e.g., Tacotron
2) usually first generate mel-spectrogram from text, and then synthesize speech
from the mel-spectrogram using vocoder such as WaveNet. Compared with
traditional concatenative and statistical parametric approaches, neural network
based end-to-end models suffer from slow inference speed, and the synthesized
speech is usually not robust (i.e., some words are skipped or repeated) and
lack of controllability (voice speed or prosody control). In this work, we
propose a novel feed-forward network based on Transformer to generate
mel-spectrogram in parallel for TTS. Specifically, we extract attention
alignments from an encoder-decoder based teacher model for phoneme duration
prediction, which is used by a length regulator to expand the source phoneme
sequence to match the length of the target mel-spectrogram sequence for
parallel mel-spectrogram generation. Experiments on the LJSpeech dataset show
that our parallel model matches autoregressive models in terms of speech
quality, nearly eliminates the problem of word skipping and repeating in
particularly hard cases, and can adjust voice speed smoothly. Most importantly,
compared with autoregressive Transformer TTS, our model speeds up
mel-spectrogram generation by 270x and the end-to-end speech synthesis by 38x.
Therefore, we call our model FastSpeech.
