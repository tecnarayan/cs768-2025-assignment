  abstract = {A new probabilistic model of data encryption is introduced. For this model, under suitable complexity assumptions, it is proved that extracting any information about the cleartext from the cyphertext is hard on the average for an adversary with polynomially bounded computational resources. The proof holds for any message space with any probability distribution. The first implementation of this model is presented. The security of this implementation is proved under the interactability assumptin of deciding Quadratic Residuosity modulo composite numbers whose factorization is unknown.},

 abstract = {When studying convergence of measures, an important issue is the choice of probability metric. We provide a summary and some new results concerning bounds among some important probability metrics/distances that are used by statisticians and probabilists. Knowledge of other metrics can provide a means of deriving bounds for another one in an applied problem. Considering other metrics can also provide alternate insights. We also give examples that show that rates of convergence can strongly depend on the metric chosen. Careful consideration is necessary when choosing a metric.},

It provides a formal privacy guarantee, ensuring that sensitive information relative to individuals cannot be easily inferred by disclosing answers to aggregate queries. If two databases are adjacent, i.e. differ only for an individual, then the query should not allow to tell them apart by more than a certain factor. This induces a bound also on the distinguishability of two generic databases, which is determined by their distance on the Hamming graph of the adjacency relation.",

  abstract  = {ABSTRACT
We introduce a model for differentially private analysis of
weighted graphs in which the graph topology $(V, E)$ is assumed
to be public and the private information consists
only of the edge weights $ w : E \rightarrow R^{+}$. This can express
hiding congestion patterns in a known system of roads. Differential
privacy requires that the output of an algorithm
provides little advantage, measured by privacy parameters $\epsilon$
and $\delta$, for distinguishing between neighboring inputs, which
are thought of as inputs that differ on the contribution of
one individual. In our model, two weight functions $w,w^{'}$
are considered to be neighboring if they have $l_{1}$ distance at
most one.
We study the problems of privately releasing a short path
between a pair of vertices and of privately releasing approximate
distances between all pairs of vertices. We are concerned
with the approximation error, the difference between
the length of the released path or released distance and the
length of the shortest path or actual distance.
For the problem of privately releasing a short path between
a pair of vertices, we prove a lower bound of $\Omega(|V|)$
on the additive approximation error for fixed privacy parameters
$\epsilon$ and $\delta$. We provide a differentially private algorithm
that matches this error bound up to a logarithmic factor and
releases paths between all pairs of vertices, not just a single
pair. The approximation error achieved by our algorithm
can be bounded by the number of edges on the shortest path,
so we achieve better accuracy than the worst-case bound for
pairs of vertices that are connected by a low-weight path
consisting of $o(|V|)$ vertices.
For the problem of privately releasing all-pairs distances,
we show that for trees we can release all-pairs distances with
approximation error $O(log^{2.5} |V|)$ for fixed privacy parameters.
For arbitrary bounded-weight graphs with edge weights
in$ [0,M]$ we can release all distances with approximation error
$O(\sqrt{|V|M}).$},

PINQ's unconditional structural guarantees require no trust placed in the expertise or diligence of the analysts, substantially broadening the scope for design and deployment of privacy-preserving data analysis, especially by non-experts.

  abstract = 	 {Many data summarization applications are captured by the general framework of submodular maximization. As a consequence, a wide range of efficient approximation algorithms have been developed. However, when such applications involve sensitive data about individuals, their privacy concerns are not automatically addressed. To remedy this problem, we propose a general and systematic study of differentially private submodular maximization. We present privacy-preserving algorithms for both monotone and non-monotone submodular maximization under cardinality, matroid, and p-extendible system constraints, with guarantees that are competitive with optimal. Along the way, we analyze a new algorithm for non-monotone submodular maximization, which is the first (even non-privately) to achieve a constant approximation ratio while running in linear time. We additionally provide two concrete experiments to validate the efficacy of these algorithms.}
