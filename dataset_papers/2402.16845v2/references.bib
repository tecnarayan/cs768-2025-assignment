   abstract = {The classical development of neural networks has primarily focused on learning mappings between finite-dimensional Euclidean spaces. Recently, this has been generalized to neural operators that learn mappings between function spaces. For partial differential equations (PDEs), neural operators directly learn the mapping from any functional parametric dependence to the solution. Thus, they learn an entire family of PDEs, in contrast to classical methods which solve one instance of the equation. In this work, we formulate a new neural operator by parameterizing the integral kernel directly in Fourier space, allowing for an expressive and efficient architecture. We perform experiments on Burgers' equation, Darcy flow, and Navier-Stokes equation. The Fourier neural operator is the first ML-based method to successfully model turbulent flows with zero-shot super-resolution. It is up to three orders of magnitude faster compared to traditional PDE solvers. Additionally, it achieves superior accuracy compared to previous learning-based solvers under fixed resolution.},

   abstract = {Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) have proven to be an efficient and effective method for resolution-independent operator learning in a broad variety of application areas across scientific machine learning. A key reason for their success is their ability to accurately model long-range dependencies in spatio-temporal data by learning global convolutions in a computationally efficient manner. To this end, FNOs rely on the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), however, DFTs cause visual and spectral artifacts as well as pronounced dissipation when learning operators in spherical coordinates since they incorrectly assume a flat geometry. To overcome this limitation, we generalize FNOs on the sphere, introducing Spherical FNOs (SFNOs) for learning operators on spherical geometries. We apply SFNOs to forecasting atmospheric dynamics, and demonstrate stable auto\-regressive rollouts for a year of simulated time (1,460 steps), while retaining physically plausible dynamics. The SFNO has important implications for machine learning-based simulation of climate dynamics that could eventually help accelerate our response to climate change.},

   abstract = {The classical development of neural networks has primarily focused on learning mappings between finite dimensional Euclidean spaces or finite sets. We propose a generalization of neural networks to learn operators, termed neural operators, that map between infinite dimensional function spaces. We formulate the neural operator as a composition of linear integral operators and nonlinear activation functions. We prove a universal approximation theorem for our proposed neural operator, showing that it can approximate any given nonlinear continuous operator. The proposed neural operators are also discretization-invariant, i.e., they share the same model parameters among different discretization of the underlying function spaces. Furthermore, we introduce four classes of efficient parameterization, viz., graph neural operators, multi-pole graph neural operators, low-rank neural operators, and Fourier neural operators. An important application for neural operators is learning surrogate maps for the solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs). We consider standard PDEs such as the Burgers, Darcy subsurface flow, and the Navier-Stokes equations, and show that the proposed neural operators have superior performance compared to existing machine learning based methodologies, while being several orders of magnitude faster than conventional PDE solvers.},

Prior works on neural operators proposed a series of novel methods to learn such maps and demonstrated unprecedented success in learning solution operators of partial differential equations. Due to their close proximity to fully connected architectures, these models mainly suffer from high memory usage and are generally limited to shallow deep learning models. In this paper, we propose U-shaped Neural Operator (U-NO), a U-shaped memory enhanced architecture that allows for deeper neural operators. U-NOs exploit the problem structures in function predictions and demonstrate fast training, data efficiency, and robustness with respect to hyperparameters choices. We study the performance of U-NO on PDE benchmarks, namely, Darcy's flow law and the Navier-Stokes equations. We show that U-NO results in an average of 26% and 44% prediction improvement on Darcy's flow and turbulent Navier-Stokes equations, respectively, over the state of the art. On Navier-Stokes 3D spatiotemporal operator learning task, we show U-NO provides 37% improvement over the state of art methods.},

   abstract = {Spherical CNNs generalize CNNs to functions on the sphere, by using spherical convolutions as the main linear operation. The most accurate and efficient way to compute spherical convolutions is in the spectral domain (via the convolution theorem), which is still costlier than the usual planar convolutions. For this reason, applications of spherical CNNs have so far been limited to small problems that can be approached with low model capacity. In this work, we show how spherical CNNs can be scaled for much larger problems. To achieve this, we make critical improvements including novel variants of common model components, an implementation of core operations to exploit hardware accelerator characteristics, and application-specific input representations that exploit the properties of our model. Experiments show our larger spherical CNNs reach state-of-the-art on several targets of the QM9 molecular benchmark, which was previously dominated by equivariant graph neural networks, and achieve competitive performance on multiple weather forecasting tasks.

   abstract = {Learning equivariant representations is a promising way to reduce sample and model complexity and improve the generalization performance of deep neural networks. The spherical CNNs are successful examples, producing SO(3)-equivariant representations of spherical inputs. There are two main types of spherical CNNs. The first type lifts the inputs to functions on the rotation group SO(3) and applies convolutions on the group, which are computationally expensive since SO(3) has one extra dimension. The second type applies convolutions directly on the sphere, which are limited to zonal (isotropic) filters, and thus have limited expressivity. In this paper, we present a new type of spherical CNN that allows anisotropic filters in an efficient way, without ever leaving the spherical domain. The key idea is to consider spin-weighted spherical functions, which were introduced in physics in the study of gravitational waves. These are complex-valued functions on the sphere whose phases change upon rotation. We define a convolution between spin-weighted functions and build a CNN based on it. The spin-weighted functions can also be interpreted as spherical vector fields, allowing applications to tasks where the inputs or outputs are vector fields. Experiments show that our method outperforms previous methods on tasks like classification of spherical images, classification of 3D shapes and semantic segmentation of spherical panoramas.},

The fundamental property of any sampling theorem is the number of samples required to represent a band-limited signal. To represent exactly a signal on the sphere band-limited at L, all sampling theorems on the sphere require O(L^2) samples. However, our sampling theorem requires less than half the number of samples of other equiangular sampling theorems on the sphere and an asymptotically identical, but smaller, number of samples than the Gauss-Legendre sampling theorem. The complexity of our algorithms scale as O(L^3), however, the continual use of fast Fourier transforms reduces the constant prefactor associated with the asymptotic scaling considerably, resulting in algorithms that are fast. Furthermore, we do not require any precomputation and our algorithms apply to both scalar and spin functions on the sphere without any change in computational complexity or computation time. We make our implementation of these algorithms available publicly and perform numerical experiments demonstrating their speed and accuracy up to very high band-limits. Finally, we highlight the advantages of our sampling theorem in the context of potential applications, notably in the field of compressive sampling.},

   abstract = {The spectral element method for the two-dimensional shallow water equations on the sphere is presented. The equations are written in conservation form and the domains are discretized using quadrilateral elements obtained from the generalized icosahedral grid introduced previously (Giraldo FX. Lagrange-Galerkin methods on spherical geodesic grids: the shallow water equations. Journal of Computational Physics 2000; 160: 336-368). The equations are written in Cartesian coordinates that introduce an additional momentum equation, but the pole singularities disappear. This paper represents a departure from previously published work on solving the shallow water equations on the sphere in that the equations are all written, discretized, and solved in three-dimensional Cartesian space. Because the equations are written in a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, the algorithm simplifies into the integration of surface elements on the sphere from the fully three-dimensional equations. A mapping (Song Ch, Wolf JP. The scaled boundary finite element method-alias consistent infinitesimal finite element cell method-for diffusion. International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering 1999; 45: 1403-1431) which simplifies these computations is described and is shown to contain the Eulerian version of the method introduced previously by Giraldo (Journal of Computational Physics 2000; 160: 336-368) for the special case of triangular elements. The significance of this mapping is that although the equations are written in Cartesian coordinates , the mapping takes into account the curvature of the high-order spectral elements, thereby allowing the elements to lie entirely on the surface of the sphere. In addition, using this mapping simplifies all of the three-dimensional spectral-type finite element surface integrals because any of the typical two-dimensional planar finite element or spectral element basis functions found in any textbook (for example, Huebner et al.},

   abstract = {Learning pose invariant representation is a fundamental problem in shape analysis. Most existing deep learning algorithms for 3D shape analysis are not robust to rotations and are often trained on synthetic datasets consisting of pre-aligned shapes, yielding poor generalization to unseen poses. This observation motivates a growing interest in rotation invariant and equivariant methods. The field of rotation equivariant deep learning is developing in recent years thanks to a well established theory of Lie group representations and convolutions. A fundamental problem in equivari-ant deep learning is to design activation functions which are both informative and preserve equivariance. The recently introduced Tensor Field Network (TFN) framework provides a rotation equivariant network design for point cloud analysis. TFN features undergo a rotation in feature space given a rotation of the input pointcloud. TFN and similar designs consider nonlinearities which operate only over rotation invariant features such as the norm of equivariant features to preserve equivariance, making them unable to capture the directional information. In a recent work entitled "Gauge Equivariant Mesh CNNs: Anisotropic Con-volutions on Geometric Graphs" Hann et al. interpret 2D rotation equivariant features as Fourier coefficients of functions on the circle. In this work we transpose the idea of Hann et al. to 3D by interpreting TFN features as spherical harmonics coefficients of functions on the sphere. We introduce a new equivariant nonlinearity and pooling for TFN. We show improvments over the original TFN design and other equivariant nonlinearities in classification and segmentation tasks. Furthermore our method is competitive with state of the art rotation invariant methods in some instances.},

   abstract = {The last decade has witnessed an experimental revolution in data science and machine learning, epitomised by deep learning methods. Indeed, many high-dimensional learning tasks previously thought to be beyond reach -- such as computer vision, playing Go, or protein folding -- are in fact feasible with appropriate computational scale. Remarkably, the essence of deep learning is built from two simple algorithmic principles: first, the notion of representation or feature learning, whereby adapted, often hierarchical, features capture the appropriate notion of regularity for each task, and second, learning by local gradient-descent type methods, typically implemented as backpropagation. While learning generic functions in high dimensions is a cursed estimation problem, most tasks of interest are not generic, and come with essential pre-defined regularities arising from the underlying low-dimensionality and structure of the physical world. This text is concerned with exposing these regularities through unified geometric principles that can be applied throughout a wide spectrum of applications. Such a 'geometric unification' endeavour, in the spirit of Felix Klein's Erlangen Program, serves a dual purpose: on one hand, it provides a common mathematical framework to study the most successful neural network architectures, such as CNNs, RNNs, GNNs, and Transformers. On the other hand, it gives a constructive procedure to incorporate prior physical knowledge into neural architectures and provide principled way to build future architectures yet to be invented.},

Continuous approaches capture rotational equivariance but are often prohibitively computationally demanding. Discrete approaches offer more favorable computational performance but at the cost of equivariance. We develop a hybrid discrete-continuous (DISCO) group convolution that is simultaneously equivariant and computationally scalable to high-resolution. While our framework can be applied to any compact group, we specialize to the sphere. Our DISCO spherical convolutions not only exhibit $\text\{SO\}(3)$ rotational equivariance but also a form of asymptotic $\text\{SO\}(3)/\text\{SO\}(2)$ rotational equivariance, which is more desirable for many applications (where $\text\{SO\}(n)$ is the special orthogonal group representing rotations in $n$-dimensions). Through a sparse tensor implementation we achieve linear scaling in number of pixels on the sphere for both computational cost and memory usage. For 4k spherical images we realize a saving of $10^9$ in computational cost and $10^4$ in memory usage when compared to the most efficient alternative equivariant spherical convolution. We apply the DISCO spherical CNN framework to a number of benchmark dense-prediction problems on the sphere, such as semantic segmentation and depth estimation, on all of which we achieve the state-of-the-art performance.},

Examples include omnidirectional vision for drones, robots, and autonomous cars, molecular regression problems, and global weather and climate modelling. A naive application of convolutional networks to a planar projection of the spherical signal is destined to fail, because the space-varying distortions introduced by such a projection will make translational weight sharing ineffective. In this paper we introduce the building blocks for constructing spherical CNNs. We propose a definition for the spherical cross-correlation that is both expressive and rotation-equivariant. The spherical correlation satisfies a generalized Fourier theorem, which allows us to compute it efficiently using a generalized (non-commutative) Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm.

We completely characterize those activation functions $\sigma$ for which the associated complex networks have the universal approximation property, meaning that they can uniformly approximate any continuous function on any compact subset of $\mathbb\{C\}^d$ arbitrarily well. Unlike the classical case of real networks, the set of "good activation functions" which give rise to networks with the universal approximation property differs significantly depending on whether one considers deep networks or shallow networks: For deep networks with at least two hidden layers, the universal approximation property holds as long as $\sigma$ is neither a polynomial, a holomorphic function, or an antiholomorphic function. Shallow networks, on the other hand, are universal if and only if the real part or the imaginary part of $\sigma$ is not a polyharmonic function.},

   abstract = {We observe that despite their hierarchical convolutional nature, the synthesis process of typical generative adversarial networks depends on absolute pixel coordinates in an unhealthy manner. This manifests itself as, e.g., detail appearing to be glued to image coordinates instead of the surfaces of depicted objects. We trace the root cause to careless signal processing that causes aliasing in the generator network. Interpreting all signals in the network as continuous, we derive generally applicable, small architectural changes that guarantee that unwanted information cannot leak into the hierarchical synthesis process. The resulting networks match the FID of StyleGAN2 but differ dramatically in their internal representations, and they are fully equivariant to translation and rotation even at subpixel scales. Our results pave the way for generative models better suited for video and animation.},

   abstract = {In this paper, we present Pangu-Weather, a deep learning based system for fast and accurate global weather forecast. For this purpose, we establish a data-driven environment by downloading $43$ years of hourly global weather data from the 5th generation of ECMWF reanalysis (ERA5) data and train a few deep neural networks with about $256$ million parameters in total. The spatial resolution of forecast is $0.25^\circ\times0.25^\circ$, comparable to the ECMWF Integrated Forecast Systems (IFS). More importantly, for the first time, an AI-based method outperforms state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction (NWP) methods in terms of accuracy (latitude-weighted RMSE and ACC) of all factors (e.g., geopotential, specific humidity, wind speed, temperature, etc.) and in all time ranges (from one hour to one week). There are two key strategies to improve the prediction accuracy: (i) designing a 3D Earth Specific Transformer (3DEST) architecture that formulates the height (pressure level) information into cubic data, and (ii) applying a hierarchical temporal aggregation algorithm to alleviate cumulative forecast errors. In deterministic forecast, Pangu-Weather shows great advantages for short to medium-range forecast (i.e., forecast time ranges from one hour to one week). Pangu-Weather supports a wide range of downstream forecast scenarios, including extreme weather forecast (e.g., tropical cyclone tracking) and large-member ensemble forecast in real-time. Pangu-Weather not only ends the debate on whether AI-based methods can surpass conventional NWP methods, but also reveals novel directions for improving deep learning weather forecast systems.},

It has important implications for planning wind energy resources, predicting extreme weather events such as tropical cyclones, extra-tropical cyclones, and atmospheric rivers. FourCastNet matches the forecasting accuracy of the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS), a state-of-the-art Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model, at short lead times for large-scale variables, while outperforming IFS for variables with complex fine-scale structure, including precipitation. FourCastNet generates a week-long forecast in less than 2 seconds, orders of magnitude faster than IFS. The speed of FourCastNet enables the creation of rapid and inexpensive large-ensemble forecasts with thousands of ensemble-members for improving probabilistic forecasting.

   abstract = {We introduce a machine-learning (ML)-based weather simulator--called "GraphCast"--which outperforms the most accurate deterministic operational medium-range weather forecasting system in the world, as well as all previous ML baselines. GraphCast is an autoregressive model, based on graph neural networks and a novel high-resolution multi-scale mesh representation, which we trained on historical weather data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)'s ERA5 reanalysis archive. It can make 10-day forecasts, at 6-hour time intervals, of five surface variables and six atmospheric variables, each at 37 vertical pressure levels, on a 0.25-degree latitude-longitude grid, which corresponds to roughly 25 x 25 kilometer resolution at the equator. Our results show GraphCast is more accurate than ECMWF's deterministic operational forecasting system, HRES, on 90.0% of the 2760 variable and lead time combinations we evaluated. GraphCast also outperforms the most accurate previous ML-based weather forecasting model on 99.2% of the 252 targets it reported. GraphCast can generate a 10-day forecast (35 gigabytes of data) in under 60 seconds on Cloud TPU v4 hardware. Unlike traditional forecasting methods, ML-based forecasting scales well with data: by training on bigger, higher quality, and more recent data, the skill of the forecasts can improve. Together these results represent a key step forward in complementing and improving weather modeling with ML, open new opportunities for fast, accurate forecasting, and help realize the promise of ML-based simulation in the physical sciences.},

Explicitly vectorized variations of the algorithm based on the Gauss-Legendre quadrature are discussed and implemented in the SHTns library, which includes scalar and vector transforms. The main breakthrough is to achieve very efficient on-the-fly computations of the Legendre-associated functions, even for very high resolutions, by taking advantage of the specific properties of the SHT and the advanced capabilities of current and future computers. This allows us to simultaneously and significantly reduce memory usage and computation time of the SHT. We measure the performance and accuracy of our algorithms. Although the complexity of the algorithms implemented in SHTns are in ON3 (where N is the maximum harmonic degree of the transform), they perform much better than any third-party implementation, including lower-complexity algorithms, even for truncations as high as N = 1023.

The numerical solutions are very accurate, there are no spurious oscillations in test case 5, and the model conserves mass to machine precision.

Although intense research activity during the last decades has led to substantial advances in the development of powerful computational methods for conservation laws, their solution remains a challenge and many questions are left open; thus it is an active and fruitful area of research. The text offers the first comprehensive introduction to modern computational methods and their analysis for hyperbolic conservation laws, building on intense research activities for more than four decades of development. It discusses classic results on monotone and finite difference/finite volume schemes, but emphasizes the successful development of high-order accurate methods for hyperbolic conservation laws. Through a modern approach, it addresses modern concepts of TVD and entropy stability, strongly stable Runge-Kutta schemes, and limiter-based methods before discussing essentially nonoscillatory schemes, discontinuous Galerkin methods, and spectral methods. A unique feature is its emphasis on algorithmic aspects of the methods, emphasizing one- and two-dimensional problems and the development and analysis of an extensive range of methods. MATLAB software is included for all main methods and computational results in the book can be reproduced and used to demonstrate the performance of many methods on a set of benchmark problems to allow direct comparisons.},

This requires a well-balanced discretization, that cannot rely on exact quadrature, due to the curved mesh. Using the strong form of the discontinuous Galerkin discretization, we achieve a splitting of the well-balanced condition into individual problems for the flux and volume terms, which has significant advantages: It allows for the construction of non-conforming, well-balanced flux discretizations, i.e. we can perform non-conforming mesh refinement while preserving the well-balanced property of the scheme. More importantly, this approach enables the development of a new method for handling wet/dry transitions. In contrast to other wetting/drying methods, it is well-balanced and able to handle wetting/drying robustly at any polynomial order, without the introduction of physical model assumptions such as viscosity, artificial porosity or cancellation of gravity. We perform a series of one-dimensional tests and analyze the properties of our scheme. In order to validate our method for the simulation of large-scale tsunami events on the rotating sphere, we perform numerical simulations of the 2011 Tohoku tsunami and compare our results to real-world buoy data. The method is able to predict arrival times and wave amplitudes accurately even over long distances.

We consider a variety of configurations, including Poisson problems with interfaces across which the solution is discontinuous (of the type arising in multi-fluid flows). The algorithm is based on a combination of the Correction Function Method (CFM) and Boundary Integral Methods (BIM). Interface and boundary conditions can be treated in a fast and accurate manner using boundary integral equations, and the associated BIM. Unfortunately, BIM can be costly when the solution is needed everywhere in a grid, e.g. fluid flow problems. We use the CFM to circumvent this issue. The solution from the BIM is used to rewrite the problem as a series of Poisson problems in rectangular domains - which requires the BIM solution at interfaces/boundaries only. These Poisson problems involve discontinuities at interfaces, of the type that the CFM can handle. Hence we use the CFM to solve them (to high order of accuracy) with finite differences and a Fast Fourier Transform based fast Poisson solver. We present 2-D examples of the algorithm applied to Poisson problems involving complex geometries, including cases in which the solution is discontinuous. We show that the algorithm produces solutions that converge with either 3rd or 4th order of accuracy, depending on the type of boundary condition and solution discontinuity.},

The Green's function for a coercive elliptic differential operator in divergence form was shown to be highly separable [2], and efficient numerical algorithms exploiting low-rank structures of the discretized systems were developed. In this work, a new approach to study the approximate separability of the Green's function of the Helmholtz equation in the high-frequency limit is developed. We show (1) lower bounds based on an explicit characterization of the correlation between two Green's functions and a tight dimension estimate for the best linear subspace to approximate a set of decorrelated Green's functions, (2) upper bounds based on constructing specific separable approximations, and (3) sharpness of these bounds for a few case studies of practical interest. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

This is often for a good reason, since in bounded domains under certain boundary conditions the solution of the Helmholtz equation is not unique at wavenumbers that correspond to eigenvalues of the Laplacian, and thus the variational problem cannot be sign-definite. However, even in cases where the solution is unique for all wavenumbers, the standard variational formulations of the Helmholtz equation are still indefinite when the wavenumber is large. This indefiniteness has implications for both the analysis and the practical implementation of finite element methods. In this paper we introduce new sign-definite (also called coercive or elliptic) formulations of the Helmholtz equation posed in either the interior of a star-shaped domain with impedance boundary conditions or the exterior of a star-shaped domain with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Like the standard variational formulations, these new formulations arise from simply multiplying the Helmholtz equation by particular test functions and integrating by parts. © 2014 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.},

   abstract = {The Helmholtz equation arises when modeling wave propagation in the frequency domain. The equation is discretized as an indefinite linear system, which is difficult to solve at high wave numbers. In many applications, the solution of the Helmholtz equation is required for a point source. In this case, it is possible to reformulate the equation as two separate equations: one for the travel time of the wave and one for its amplitude. The travel time is obtained by a solution of the factored eikonal equation, and the amplitude is obtained by solving a complex-valued advection–diffusion–reaction equation. The reformulated equation is equivalent to the original Helmholtz equation, and the differences between the numerical solutions of these equations arise only from discretization errors. We develop an efficient multigrid solver for obtaining the amplitude given the travel time, which can be efficiently computed. This approach is advantageous because the amplitude is typically smooth in this case and, hence, more suitable for multigrid solvers than the standard Helmholtz discretization. We demonstrate that our second-order advection–diffusion–reaction discretization is more accurate than the standard second-order discretization at high wave numbers, as long as there are no reflections or caustics. Moreover, we show that using our approach, the problem can be solved more efficiently than using the common shifted Laplacian multigrid approach.},

   abstract = {The displacement field for three dimensional dynamic elasticity problems in the frequency domain can be decomposed into a sum of a longitudinal and a transversal part known as a Helmholtz decomposition. The Cartesian components of both the longitudinal and transverse fields satisfy scalar Helmholtz equations that can be solved using a desingularized boundary element method (BEM) framework. The curl free longitudinal and divergence free transversal conditions can also be cast as additional scalar Helmholtz equations. When compared to other BEM implementations, the current framework leads to smaller matrix dimensions and a simpler conceptual approach. The numerical implementation of this approach is benchmarked against the 3D elastic wave field generated by a rigid vibrating sphere embedded in an infinite linear elastic medium for which the analytical solution has been derived. Examples of focused 3D elastic waves generated by a vibrating bowl-shaped rigid object with convex and concave surfaces are also considered. In the static zero frequency limit, the Helmholtz decomposition becomes non-unique, and both the longitudinal and transverse components contain divergent terms that are proportional to the inverse square of the frequency. However, these divergences are equal and opposite so that their sum, that is the displacement field that reflects the physics of the problem, remains finite in the zero frequency limit.},

ICON is a joint project of the German Weather Service (DWD) and the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPI-M), targeting a unified modelling system for global numerical weather prediction (NWP) and climate modelling. Compared with the existing models at both institutions, the main achievements of ICON are exact local mass conservation, mass-consistent tracer transport, a flexible grid nesting capability and the use of non-hydrostatic equations on global domains. The dynamical core is formulated on an icosahedral-triangular Arakawa C grid. Achieving mass conservation is facilitated by a flux-form continuity equation with density as the prognostic variable. Time integration is performed with a two-time-level predictor-corrector scheme that is fully explicit, except for the terms describing vertical sound-wave propagation. To achieve competitive computational efficiency, time splitting is applied between the dynamical core on the one hand and tracer advection, physics parametrizations and horizontal diffusion on the other hand. A sequence of tests with varying complexity indicates that the ICON dynamical core combines high numerical stability over steep mountain slopes with good accuracy and reasonably low diffusivity. Preliminary NWP test suites initialized with interpolated analysis data reveal that the ICON modelling system already achieves better skill scores than its predecessor at DWD, the operational hydrostatic Global Model Europe (GME), and at the same time requires significantly fewer computational resources.},

   abstract = {The simulation of systems with dynamics on strongly varying time scales is quite challenging and demanding with regard to possible numerical methods. A rather naive approach is to use the smallest necessary time step to guarantee a stable integration of the fast frequencies. However, this typically leads to unacceptable computational loads. Alternatively, multirate methods integrate the slow part of the system with a relatively large step size while the fast part is integrated with a small time step. In this work, a multirate integrator for constrained dynamical systems is derived in closed form via a discrete variational principle on a time grid consisting of macro and micro time nodes. Being based on a discrete version of Hamilton's principle, the resulting variational multirate integrator is a symplectic and momentum preserving integration scheme and also exhibits good energy behaviour. Depending on the discrete approximations for the Lagrangian function, one obtains different integrators, e.g. purely implicit or purely explicit schemes, or methods that treat the fast and slow parts in different ways. The performance of the multirate integrator is demonstrated by means of several examples.},

The equations are written in conservation form and the domains are discretized using quadrilateral elements. Lagrangian methods integrate the governing equations along the characteristic curves, thus being well suited for resolving the nonlinearities introduced by the advection operator of the fluid dynamics equations. Two types of Lagrange-Galerkin methods are presented: the strong and weak formulations. The strong form relies mainly on interpolation to achieve high accuracy while the weak form relies primarily on integration. Lagrange-Galerkin schemes offer an increased efficiency by virtue of their less stringent CFL condition. The use of quadrilateral elements permits the construction of spectral-type finite-element methods that exhibit exponential convergence as in the conventional spectral method, yet they are constructed locally as in the finite-element method; this is the spectral element method. In this paper, we show how to fuse the Lagrange-Galerkin methods with the spectral element method and present results for two standard test cases in order to compare and contrast these two hybrid schemes. © 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

Validation against published data is presented and possibilities of the newly developed computational framework are illustrated on several examples.},

@article{Bermudez1994,
   abstract = {This paper deals with the extension of some upwind schemes to hyperbolic systems of conservation laws with source term. More precisely we give methods to get natural upwind discretizations of the source term when the flux is approximated by using flux-difference or flux-splitting techniques. In particular, the Q-schemes of Roe and van Leer and the flux-splitting techniques of Steger-Warming and Vijayasundaram are considered. Numerical results for a scalar advection equation with nonlinear source and for the one-dimensional shallow water equations are presented. In the last case we compare the different schemes proposed in terms of a conservation property. When this property does not hold, spurious numerical waves can appear which is the case for the centred discretization of the source term. © 1994.},
