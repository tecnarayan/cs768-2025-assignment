abstract = {Live-streaming platforms broadcast user-generated video in real-time. Recommendation on these platforms shares similarities with traditional settings, such as a large volume of heterogeneous content and highly skewed interaction distributions. However, several challenges must be overcome to adapt recommendation algorithms to live-streaming platforms: first, content availability is dynamic which restricts users to choose from only a subset of items at any given time; during training and inference we must carefully handle this factor in order to properly account for such signals, where ‘non-interactions’ reflect availability as much as implicit preference. Streamers are also fundamentally different from ‘items’ in traditional settings: repeat consumption of specific channels plays a significant role, though the content itself is fundamentally ephemeral. In this work, we study recommendation in this setting of a dynamically evolving set of available items. We propose LiveRec, a self-attentive model that personalizes item ranking based on both historical interactions and current availability. We also show that carefully modelling repeat consumption plays a significant role in model performance. To validate our approach, and to inspire further research on this setting, we release a dataset containing 475M user interactions on Twitch over a 43-day period. We evaluate our approach on a recommendation task and show our method to outperform various strong baselines in ranking the currently available content.},

Recent work on reading comprehension made headway in answering simple questions, but tackling complex questions is still an ongoing research challenge. Conversely, semantic parsers have been successful at handling compositionality, but only when the information resides in a target knowledge-base. In this paper, we present a novel framework for answering broad and complex questions, assuming answering simple questions is possible using a search engine and a reading comprehension model. We propose to decompose complex questions into a sequence of simple questions, and compute the final answer from the sequence of answers. To illustrate the viability of our approach, we create a new dataset of complex questions, ComplexWebQuestions, and present a model that decomposes questions and interacts with the web to compute an answer. We empirically demonstrate that question decomposition improves performance from 20.8 precision@1 to 27.5 precision@1 on this new dataset.",

In this direction translating natural language questions to formal queries has been one of the key approaches. To advance the research area, several datasets like WebQuestions, QALD and LCQuAD have been published in the past. The biggest data set available for complex questions (LCQuAD) over knowledge graphs contains five thousand questions. We now provide LC-QuAD 2.0 (Large-Scale Complex Question Answering Dataset) with 30,000 questions, their paraphrases and their corresponding SPARQL queries. LC-QuAD 2.0 is compatible with both Wikidata and DBpedia 2018 knowledge graphs. In this article, we explain how the dataset was created and the variety of questions available with examples.

It consists of 10,181 questions and 5,693 unique complex SQL queries on 200 databases with multiple tables covering 138 different domains. We define a new complex and cross-domain semantic parsing and text-to-SQL task so that different complicated SQL queries and databases appear in train and test sets. In this way, the task requires the model to generalize well to both new SQL queries and new database schemas. Therefore, Spider is distinct from most of the previous semantic parsing tasks because they all use a single database and have the exact same program in the train set and the test set. We experiment with various state-of-the-art models and the best model achieves only 9.7{\%} exact matching accuracy on a database split setting. This shows that Spider presents a strong challenge for future research. Our dataset and task with the most recent updates are publicly available at \url{https://yale-lily.github.io/seq2sql/spider}.",

However, as human knowledge is distributed over heterogeneous forms, using homogeneous information alone might lead to severe coverage problems. To fill in the gap, we present HybridQA, a new large-scale question-answering dataset that requires reasoning on heterogeneous information. Each question is aligned with a Wikipedia table and multiple free-form corpora linked with the entities in the table. The questions are designed to aggregate both tabular information and text information, i.e., lack of either form would render the question unanswerable. We test with three different models: 1) a table-only model. 2) text-only model. 3) a hybrid model that combines heterogeneous information to find the answer. The experimental results show that the EM scores obtained by two baselines are below 20{\%}, while the hybrid model can achieve an EM over 40{\%}. This gap suggests the necessity to aggregate heterogeneous information in HybridQA. However, the hybrid model{'}s score is still far behind human performance. Hence, HybridQA can serve as a challenging benchmark to study question answering with heterogeneous information.",
