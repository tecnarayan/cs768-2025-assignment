@article{Berga07:Undominated,
	abstract = {We consider the problem of a society whose members choose, with a voting by committees, a subset of new members from a given set of candidates. After knowing the elected candidates, former members may decide to either stay or exit the society. We analyze the voting behavior of members who take into account the effect of their votes not only on the elected candidates, but also on the final composition of the society. For additive and monotonic preferences with dichotomous bads we construct a strategy profile that is an undominated pure strategy Nash equilibrium of the induced voting game. 0 2007 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.},

closely related to the coordinated attack problem. Two players have to
play one of two possible coordination games. Only one of them receives
information about the coordination game to be played. It is shown that
even if a large (but finite) number of propositions of the type 'i
knows that j knows that i knows... that the game is G' are true, the
game theoretic situation is very different from when the coordination
game played is common knowledge. The example emphasizes the importance
of the common knowledge assumption in game theory.},

The survey, conducted by Opinion Research Corporation International, also showed that most consumers are happy with their e-commerce experiences. One in five reported problems with online purchases. The most common problems were: products or services that were misrepresented (8 percent); products or services that were paid for, but never received (6 percent); charges that were billed, but never authorized (3 percent); charges that were more than the agreed price (1 percent). Despite the fact that most consumers said they prefer to pay for online orders with credit cards (67 percent) and that few reported any problems in that regard, the most common concern (41 percent) was that their credit card numbers would be stolen if they gave them online. What is even more distressing is that 69 percent of consumers incorrectly believe that it is safer to pay for an online purchase by check or money order rather than credit card, observed Grant. People don't realize that encryption is commonly used to protect financial information during transmission. And that federal law protects credit cards users if they don't get what they were promised or unauthorized charges were made to their accounts.},

Svenson (1990, 1991) suggests that higher level decision processes involve problem-solving processes, and therefore a few references including time pressure from that research area will also be cited as examples of relevant research.},
