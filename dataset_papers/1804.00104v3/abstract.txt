We present a framework for learning disentangled and interpretable jointly
continuous and discrete representations in an unsupervised manner. By
augmenting the continuous latent distribution of variational autoencoders with
a relaxed discrete distribution and controlling the amount of information
encoded in each latent unit, we show how continuous and categorical factors of
variation can be discovered automatically from data. Experiments show that the
framework disentangles continuous and discrete generative factors on various
datasets and outperforms current disentangling methods when a discrete
generative factor is prominent.
