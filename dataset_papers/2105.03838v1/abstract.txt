We present deep learning methods for the design of arrays and single
instances of small antennas. Each design instance is conditioned on a target
radiation pattern and is required to conform to specific spatial dimensions and
to include, as part of its metallic structure, a set of predetermined
locations. The solution, in the case of a single antenna, is based on a
composite neural network that combines a simulation network, a hypernetwork,
and a refinement network. In the design of the antenna array, we add an
additional design level and employ a hypernetwork within a hypernetwork. The
learning objective is based on measuring the similarity of the obtained
radiation pattern to the desired one. Our experiments demonstrate that our
approach is able to design novel antennas and antenna arrays that are compliant
with the design requirements, considerably better than the baseline methods. We
compare the solutions obtained by our method to existing designs and
demonstrate a high level of overlap. When designing the antenna array of a
cellular phone, the obtained solution displays improved properties over the
existing one.
