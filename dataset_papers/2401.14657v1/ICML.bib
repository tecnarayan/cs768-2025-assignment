abstract = {Constructing generative models for functional observations is an important task in statistical functional analysis. In general, functional data contains both phase (or x or horizontal) and amplitude (or y or vertical) variability. Traditional methods often ignore the phase variability and focus solely on the amplitude variation, using cross-sectional techniques such as fPCA for dimensional reduction and data modeling. Ignoring phase variability leads to a loss of structure in the data and inefficiency in data models. This paper presents an approach that relies on separating the phase (x-axis) and amplitude (y-axis), then modeling these components using joint distributions. This separation, in turn, is performed using a technique called elastic shape analysis of curves that involves a new mathematical representation of functional data. Then, using individual fPCAs, one each for phase and amplitude components, it imposes joint probability models on principal coefficients of these components while respecting the nonlinear geometry of the phase representation space. These ideas are demonstrated using random sampling, for models estimated from simulated and real datasets, and show their superiority over models that ignore phase-amplitude separation. Furthermore, the generative models are applied to classification of functional data and achieve high performance in applications involving SONAR signals of underwater objects, handwritten signatures, and periodic body movements recorded by smart phones.}

ABSTRACT={This study assesses the improvement of the latest Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) over Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) for precipitation simulation. Precipitation simulations under different future climate scenarios are also compared in this work. The results show that: 1) CMIP6 has no overall advantage over CMIP5 in simulating total precipitation (PRCPTOT) and maximum consecutive dry days (CDD). The performance of CMIP6 increases or decreases regionally in PRCPTOT and consecutive dry days. But it is slightly worse than CMIP5 in simulating very wet days (R95pTOT). 2) Comparing the trend test results of CMIP5 and CMIP6 in the future, there are more areas with significant trend based on Mann–Kendall test in CMIP6 compared with that of CMIP5. The differences in PRCPTOT are mainly found in Amazon Basin and Western Africa. The differences between the R95pTOT trends mainly noticeable in South America and Western Africa, and the differences in CDD are mainly reflected in Central Asia, Sahara Desert and central South America. 3) In Southern South America and Western North America, the PRCPTOT changing rate of CMIP6 in the future under various scenarios is always greater than that of CMIP5; in Alaska, Western Africa, Southern Africa, the PRCPTOT changing rate of CMIP6 in the future under various scenarios is always less than that of CMIP5. In Southern South America, the R95pTOT changing rate of CMIP6 in the future under various scenarios is always greater than that of CMIP5; in Alaska, East Asia, North Asia, the R95pTOT changing rate of CMIP6 in the future under various scenarios is always less than that of CMIP5. In almost half of the regions, the CDD changing rate of CMIP6 is less than that of CMIP5 under all scenarios, namely Australia, Amazon Basin, Southern South America, Central America, Western North America, Central North America, Eastern North America, Central Asia, Tibet.}

abstract = {This study assesses the improvements in climate model (CM) simulations for indicative characteristics representing complex dynamics of Indian summer monsoon rainfall for period 1951–2005 in CMIP6 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6). To our knowledge, this is the first preliminary study which compares the performance of models available in CMIP5 and CMIP6 consortium and their multi-model average (MMA). We find a significant improvement in CMIP6 models in capturing the spatiotemporal pattern of monsoon over Indian landmass, especially in the Western Ghats and North-East foothills of Himalayas. We also show that present-day global warming of 0.6 °C over Indian landmass is remarkably consistent with the changes in annual maximum 1-day precipitation in MMA of CMIP6, which are in agreement with the observations. Our results suggest that added value in CMIP6 models precipitation simulations is not consistent within CMs used in present study. However, it still provides a precedent to the scientific community in performing future studies on climate change impact assessment.}
