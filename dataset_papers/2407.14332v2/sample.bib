  abstract = 	 {In recent years, federated learning has been embraced as an approach for bringing about collaboration across large populations of learning agents. However, little is known about how collaboration protocols should take agents’ incentives into account when allocating individual resources for communal learning in order to maintain such collaborations. Inspired by game theoretic notions, this paper introduces a framework for incentive-aware learning and data sharing in federated learning. Our stable and envy-free equilibria capture notions of collaboration in the presence of agents interested in meeting their learning objectives while keeping their own sample collection burden low. For example, in an envy-free equilibrium, no agent would wish to swap their sampling burden with any other agent and in a stable equilibrium, no agent would wish to unilaterally reduce their sampling burden. In addition to formalizing this framework, our contributions include characterizing the structural properties of such equilibria, proving when they exist, and showing how they can be computed. Furthermore, we compare the sample complexity of incentive-aware collaboration with that of optimal collaboration when one ignores agents’ incentives.}

The agent's probability of passing each test depends on his type. In our framework, the revelation principle holds. We characterize whether each type has an associated test that best screens out all the other types. In that case, the testing technology can be represented in a tractable reduced form.

  abstract={ This paper proposes a perfectly competitive model of a market with adverse selection. Prices are determined by zero‐profit conditions, and the set of traded contracts is determined by free entry. Crucially for applications, contract characteristics are endogenously determined, consumers may have multiple dimensions of private information, and an equilibrium always exists. Equilibrium corresponds to the limit of a differentiated products Bertrand game. We apply the model to establish theoretical results on the equilibrium effects of mandates. Mandates can increase efficiency but have unintended consequences. With adverse selection, an insurance mandate reduces the price of low‐coverage policies, which necessarily has indirect effects such as increasing adverse selection on the intensive margin and causing some consumers to purchase less coverage.},

  abstract={Across a wide set of non-group insurance markets, applicants are rejected based on observable, often high-risk, characteristics. This paper argues private information, held by the potential applicant pool, explains rejections. I formulate this argument by developing and testing a model in which agents may have private information about their risk. I first derive a new no-trade result that theoretically explains how private information could cause rejections. I then develop a new empirical methodology to test whether this no-trade condition can explain rejections. The methodology uses subjective probability elicitations as noisy measures of agents beliefs. I apply this approach to three non-group markets: long-term care, disability, and life insurance. Consistent with the predictions of the theory, in all three settings I find significant amounts of private information held by those who would be rejected; I find generally more private information for those who would be rejected relative to those who can purchase insurance; and I show it is enough private information to explain a complete absence of trade for those who would be rejected. The results suggest private information prevents the existence of large segments of these three major insurance markets.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>},

  abstract={For a federated learning model to perform well, it is crucial to have a diverse and representative dataset. However, the data contributors may only be concerned with the performance on a specific subset of the population, which may not reflect the diversity of the wider population. This creates a tension between the principal (the FL platform designer) who cares about global performance and the agents (the data collectors) who care about local performance. In this work, we formulate this tension as a game between the principal and multiple agents, and focus on the linear experiment design problem to formally study their interaction. We show that the statistical criterion used to quantify the diversity of the data, as well as the choice of the federated learning algorithm used, has a significant effect on the resulting equilibrium. We leverage this to design simple optimal federated learning mechanisms that encourage data collectors to contribute data representative of the global population, thereby maximizing global performance.},

  abstract={This textbook aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the essentials of microeconomics. It offers unprecedented depth of coverage, whilst allowing lecturers to 'tailor-make' their courses to suit personal priorities. Covering topics such as noncooperative game theory, information economics, mechanism design and general equilibrium under uncertainty, it is written in a clear, accessible and engaging style and provides practice exercises and a full appendix of terminology.},

abstract="Bayes' rule provides a method for constructing estimators of probability density functions in both parametric and nonparametric cases. Let X1, X2, ..., Xn be a random sample from an unknown probability measure P0 with density function p0(x) with respect to a dominating measure $\lambda$(dx). Let {\textmu} be a prior probability measure on the space of all probability measures P which have densities p(x) = dP/d$\lambda$. Then the mean of the posterior yields the following estimator of the density function {\$}{\$}{\{}{\{}{\backslash}hat{\{}p{\}}{\}}{\_}{\{}n{\}}{\}}(x) = {\backslash}hat{\{}p{\}}(x;{\{}{\{}X{\}}{\_}{\{}1{\}}{\}},{\{}{\{}X{\}}{\_}{\{}2{\}}{\}}, {\backslash}ldots ,{\{}{\{}X{\}}{\_}{\{}n{\}}{\}}) = {\backslash}frac{\{}{\{}{\backslash}smallint p(x)({\backslash}prod {\_}{\{}{\{}i = 1{\}}{\}}^{\{}n{\}}p({\{}{\{}X{\}}{\_}{\{}i{\}}{\}}))d{\backslash}mu {\}}{\}}{\{}{\{}{\backslash}smallint ({\backslash}prod {\_}{\{}{\{}i = 1{\}}{\}}^{\{}n{\}}p({\{}{\{}X{\}}{\_}{\{}i{\}}{\}}))d{\backslash}mu {\}}{\}}.{\$}{\$}",
