    abstract = { Bridging cultures that have often been distant, Julia combines expertise from the diverse fields of computer science and computational science to create a new approach to numerical computing. Julia is designed to be easy and fast and questions notions generally held to be “laws of nature" by practitioners of numerical computing: \beginlist \item High-level dynamic programs have to be slow. \item One must prototype in one language and then rewrite in another language for speed or deployment. \item There are parts of a system appropriate for the programmer, and other parts that are best left untouched as they have been built by the experts. \endlist We introduce the Julia programming language and its design---a dance between specialization and abstraction. Specialization allows for custom treatment. Multiple dispatch, a technique from computer science, picks the right algorithm for the right circumstance. Abstraction, which is what good computation is really about, recognizes what remains the same after differences are stripped away. Abstractions in mathematics are captured as code through another technique from computer science, generic programming. Julia shows that one can achieve machine performance without sacrificing human convenience. }

  abstract = 	 {The Wasserstein distances are a set of metrics on probability distributions supported on $\mathbb{R}^d$ with applications throughout statistics and machine learning. Often, such distances are used in the context of variational problems, in which the statistician employs in place of an unknown measure a proxy constructed on the basis of independent samples. This raises the basic question of how well measures can be approximated in Wasserstein distance. While it is known that an empirical measure comprising i.i.d.&nbsp;samples is rate-optimal for general measures, no improved results were known for measures possessing smooth densities. We prove the first minimax rates for estimation of smooth densities for general Wasserstein distances, thereby showing how the curse of dimensionality can be alleviated for sufficiently regular measures. We also show how to construct discretely supported measures, suitable for computational purposes, which enjoy improved rates. Our approach is based on novel bounds between the Wasserstein distances and suitable Besov norms, which may be of independent interest.}

Thus, this paper introduces a technique for graph-based semi-supervised learning of histograms, derived from the theory of optimal transportation. Our method has several properties making it suitable for this application; in particular, its behavior can be characterized by the moments and shapes of the histograms at the labeled nodes. In addition, it can be used for histograms on non-standard domains like circles, revealing a strategy for manifold-valued semi-supervised learning. We also extend this technique to related problems such as smoothing distributions on graph nodes.}

  abstract = 	 {A rapidly growing area of work has studied the existence of adversarial examples, datapoints which have been perturbed to fool a classifier, but the vast majority of these works have focused primarily on threat models defined by $\ell_p$ norm-bounded perturbations. In this paper, we propose a new threat model for adversarial attacks based on the Wasserstein distance. In the image classification setting, such distances measure the cost of moving pixel mass, which can naturally represent “standard” image manipulations such as scaling, rotation, translation, and distortion (and can potentially be applied to other settings as well). To generate Wasserstein adversarial examples, we develop a procedure for approximate projection onto the Wasserstein ball, based upon a modified version of the Sinkhorn iteration. The resulting algorithm can successfully attack image classification models, bringing traditional CIFAR10 models down to 3% accuracy within a Wasserstein ball with radius 0.1 (i.e., moving 10% of the image mass 1 pixel), and we demonstrate that PGD-based adversarial training can improve this adversarial accuracy to 76%. In total, this work opens up a new direction of study in adversarial robustness, more formally considering convex metrics that accurately capture the invariances that we typically believe should exist in classifiers, and code for all experiments in the paper is available at https://github.com/locuslab/projected_sinkhorn.}
