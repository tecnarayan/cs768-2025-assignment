    abstract = { A new algorithm is developed for computing \$e^{tA}B\$, where A is an \$n\times n\$ matrix and B is \$n\times n\_0\$ with \$n\_0 \ll n\$. The algorithm works for any A, its computational cost is dominated by the formation of products of A with \$n\times n\_0\$ matrices, and the only input parameter is a backward error tolerance. The algorithm can return a single matrix \$e^{tA}B\$ or a sequence \$e^{t\_kA}B\$ on an equally spaced grid of points \$t\_k\$. It uses the scaling part of the scaling and squaring method together with a truncated Taylor series approximation to the exponential. It determines the amount of scaling and the Taylor degree using the recent analysis of Al-Mohy and Higham [SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl., 31 (2009), pp. 970–989], which provides sharp truncation error bounds expressed in terms of the quantities \$\|A^k\|^{1/k}\$ for a few values of k, where the norms are estimated using a matrix norm estimator. Shifting and balancing are used as preprocessing steps to reduce the cost of the algorithm. Numerical experiments show that the algorithm performs in a numerically stable fashion across a wide range of problems, and analysis of rounding errors and of the conditioning of the problem provides theoretical support. Experimental comparisons with MATLAB codes based on Krylov subspace, Chebyshev polynomial, and Laguerre polynomial methods show the new algorithm to be sometimes much superior in terms of computational cost and accuracy. An important application of the algorithm is to exponential integrators for ordinary differential equations. It is shown that the sums of the form \$\sum\_{k=0}^p \varphi\_k(A)u\_k\$ that arise in exponential integrators, where the \$\varphi\_k\$ are related to the exponential function, can be expressed in terms of a single exponential of a matrix of dimension \$n+p\$ built by augmenting A with additional rows and columns, and the algorithm of this paper can therefore be employed. }

abstract = {We derive an explicit formula for the exponential generating function associated with non-backtracking walks around a graph. We study both undirected and directed graphs. Our results allow us to derive computable expressions for non-backtracking versions of network centrality measures based on the matrix exponential. We find that eliminating backtracking walks in this context does not significantly increase the computational expense. We show how the new measures may be interpreted in terms of standard exponential centrality computation on a certain multilayer network. Insights from this block matrix interpretation also allow us to characterize centrality measures arising from general matrix functions. Rigorous analysis on the star graph illustrates the effect of non-backtracking and shows that localization can be eliminated when we restrict to non-backtracking walks. We also investigate the localization issue on synthetic networks.}

The algorithm is derived from the Arnoldi process for constructing an \$l\_2 \$-orthogonal basis of Krylov subspaces. It can be considered as a generalization of Paige and Saunders’ MINRES algorithm and is theoretically equivalent to the Generalized Conjugate Residual (GCR) method and to ORTHODIR. The new algorithm presents several advantages over GCR and ORTHODIR. }

abstract = {Several algorithms for problems including image segmentation, gradient inpainting and total variation are based on solving symmetric diagonally dominant (SDD) linear systems. These algorithms generally produce results of high quality. However, existing solvers are not always efficient, and in many cases they operate only on restricted topologies. The unavailability of reliably efficient solvers has arguably hindered the adoptability of approaches and algorithms based on SDD systems, especially in applications involving very large systems. A central claim of this paper is that SDD-based approaches can now be considered practical and reliable. To support our claim we present Combinatorial Multigrid (CMG), the first reliably efficient SDD solver that tackles problems in general and arbitrary weighted topologies. The solver borrows the structure and operators of multigrid algorithms, but embeds into them powerful and algebraically sound combinatorial preconditioners, based on novel tools from support graph theory. In order to present the derivation of CMG, we review and exemplify key notions of support graph theory that can also guide the future development of specialized solvers. We validate our claims on very large systems derived from imaging applications. Finally, we outline two new reductions of non-linear filtering problems to SDD systems and review the integration of SDD systems into selected algorithms.},

abstract = {The Conjugate Gradient Method is the most prominent iterative method for solving sparse systems of linear equations. Unfortunately, many textbook treatments of the topic are written so that even their own authors would be mystified, if they bothered to read their own writing. For this reason, an understanding of the method has been reserved for the elite brilliant few who have painstakingly decoded the mumblings of their forebears. Nevertheless, the Conjugate Gradient Method is a composite of simple, elegant ideas that almost anyone can understand. Of course, a reader as intelligent as yourself will learn them almost effortlessly. The idea of quadratic forms is introduced and used to derive the methods of Steepest Descent, Conjugate Directions, and Conjugate Gradients. Eigenvectors are explained and used to examine the convergence of the Jacobi Method, Steepest Descent, and Conjugate Gradients. Other topics include preconditioning and the nonlinear Conjugate Gradient Method. I have taken pains to make this article easy to read. Sixty-two illustrations are provided. Dense prose is avoided. Concepts are explained in several different ways. Most equations are coupled with an intuitive interpretation.}

    abstract = { The scaling and squaring method for the matrix exponential is based on the approximation \$e^A \approx (r\_m(2^{-s}A))^{2^s}\$, where \$r\_m(x)\$ is the \$[m/m]\$ Padé approximant to \$e^x\$ and the integers m and s are to be chosen. Several authors have identified a weakness of existing scaling and squaring algorithms termed overscaling, in which a value of s much larger than necessary is chosen, causing a loss of accuracy in floating point arithmetic. Building on the scaling and squaring algorithm of Higham [SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl., 26 (2005), pp. 1179–1193], which is used by the MATLAB function expm, we derive a new algorithm that alleviates the overscaling problem. Two key ideas are employed. The first, specific to triangular matrices, is to compute the diagonal elements in the squaring phase as exponentials instead of from powers of \$r\_m\$. The second idea is to base the backward error analysis that underlies the algorithm on members of the sequence \$\{\|A^k\|^{1/k}\}\$ instead of \$\|A\|\$, since for nonnormal matrices it is possible that \$\|A^k\|^{1/k}\$ is much smaller than \$\|A\|\$, and indeed this is likely when overscaling occurs in existing algorithms. The terms \$\|A^k\|^{1/k}\$ are estimated without computing powers of A by using a matrix 1-norm estimator in conjunction with a bound of the form \$\|A^k\|^{1/k} \le \max\bigl( \|A^p\|^{1/p}, \|A^q\|^{1/q} \bigr)\$ that holds for certain fixed p and q less than k. The improvements to the truncation error bounds have to be balanced by the potential for a large \$\|A\|\$ to cause inaccurate evaluation of \$r\_m\$ in floating point arithmetic. We employ rigorous error bounds along with some heuristics to ensure that rounding errors are kept under control. Our numerical experiments show that the new algorithm generally provides accuracy at least as good as the existing algorithm of Higham at no higher cost, while for matrices that are triangular or cause overscaling it usually yields significant improvements in accuracy, cost, or both. }

title = "Matrix exponentials and parallel prefix computation in a quantum control problem",
abstract = "Quantum control plays a key role in quantum technology, in particular for steering quantum systems. As problem size grows exponentially with the system size, it is necessary to deal with fast numerical algorithms and implementations. We improved an existing code for quantum control concerning two linear algebra tasks: the computation of the matrix exponential and efficient parallelisation of prefix matrix multiplication. For the matrix exponential we compare three methods: the eigendecomposition method, the Pad{\'e} method and a polynomial expansion based on Chebyshev polynomials. We show that the Chebyshev method outperforms the other methods both in terms of computation time and accuracy. For the prefix problem we compare the tree-based parallel prefix scheme, which is based on a recursive approach, with a sequential multiplication scheme where only the individual matrix multiplications are parallelised. We show that this fine-grain approach outperforms the parallel prefix scheme by a factor of 2-3, depending on parallel hardware and problem size, and also leads to lesser memory requirements. Overall, the improved linear algebra implementations not only led to a considerable runtime reduction, but also allowed us to tackle problems of larger size on the same parallel compute cluster.",
