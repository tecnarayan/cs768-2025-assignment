abstract = {This paper extends previous work with Dyna, a class of architectures for intelligent systems based on approximating dynamic programming methods. Dyna architectures integrate trial-and-error (reinforcement) learning and execution-time planning into a single process operating alternately on the world and on a learned model of the world. In this paper, I present and show results for two Dyna architectures. The Dyna-PI architecture is based on dynamic programming's policy iteration method and can be related to existing AI ideas such as evaluation functions and universal plans (reactive systems). Using a navigation task, results are shown for a simple Dyna-PI system that simultaneously learns by trial and error, learns a world model, and plans optimal routes using the evolving world model. The Dyna-Q architecture is based on Watkins's Q-learning, a new kind of reinforcement learning. Dyna-Q uses a less familiar set of data structures than does Dyna-PI, but is arguably simpler to implement and use. We show that Dyna-Q architectures are easy to adapt for use in changing environments.}

  abstract  = "The significantly expanded and updated new edition of a widely
               used text on reinforcement learning, one of the most active
               research areas in artificial intelligence. Reinforcement
               learning, one of the most active research areas in artificial
               intelligence, is a computational approach to learning whereby an
               agent tries to maximize the total amount of reward it receives
               while interacting with a complex, uncertain environment. In
               Reinforcement Learning, Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto provide
               a clear and simple account of the field's key ideas and
               algorithms. This second edition has been significantly expanded
               and updated, presenting new topics and updating coverage of
               other topics. Like the first edition, this second edition
               focuses on core online learning algorithms, with the more
               mathematical material set off in shaded boxes. Part I covers as
               much of reinforcement learning as possible without going beyond
               the tabular case for which exact solutions can be found. Many
               algorithms presented in this part are new to the second edition,
               including UCB, Expected Sarsa, and Double Learning. Part II
               extends these ideas to function approximation, with new sections
               on such topics as artificial neural networks and the Fourier
               basis, and offers expanded treatment of off-policy learning and
               policy-gradient methods. Part III has new chapters on
               reinforcement learning's relationships to psychology and
               neuroscience, as well as an updated case-studies chapter
               including AlphaGo and AlphaGo Zero, Atari game playing, and IBM
               Watson's wagering strategy. The final chapter discusses the
               future societal impacts of reinforcement learning.",

  abstract  = "A Monte-Carlo evaluation consists in estimating a position by
               averaging the outcome of several random continuations. The
               method can serve as an evaluation function at the leaves of a
               min-max tree. This paper presents a new framework to combine
               tree search with Monte-Carlo evaluation, that does not separate
               between a min-max phase and a Monte-Carlo phase. Instead of
               backing-up the min-max value close to the root, and the average
               value at some depth, a more general backup operator is defined
               that progressively changes from averaging to min-max as the
               number of simulations grows. This approach provides a
               fine-grained control of the tree growth, at the level of
               individual simulations, and allows efficient selectivity. The
               resulting algorithm was implemented in a 9$\times$9 Go-playing

               itself and learning from the results. TD-Gammon uses a recently
               proposed reinforcement learning algorithm called TD($\lambda$)
               (Sutton, 1988), and is apparently the first application of this
               algorithm to a complex nontrivial task. Despite starting from
               random initial weights (and hence random initial strategy),
               TD-Gammon achieves a surprisingly strong level of play. With
               zero knowledge built in at the start of learning (i.e. given
               only a ``raw'' description of the board state), the network
               learns to play the entire game at a strong intermediate level
               that surpasses not only conventional commercial programs, but
               also comparable networks trained via supervised learning on a
               large corpus of human expert games. The hidden units in the
               network have apparently discovered useful features, a
               longstanding goal of computer games research.",

               environments. As a stepping stone to this goal, the domain of
               StarCraft has emerged as an important challenge for artificial
               intelligence research, owing to its iconic and enduring status
               among the most difficult professional esports and its relevance
               to the real world in terms of its raw complexity and multi-agent
               challenges. Over the course of a decade and numerous
               competitions1--3, the strongest agents have simplified important
               aspects of the game, utilized superhuman capabilities, or
               employed hand-crafted sub-systems4. Despite these advantages, no
               previous agent has come close to matching the overall skill of
               top StarCraft players. We chose to address the challenge of
               StarCraft using general-purpose learning methods that are in
               principle applicable to other complex domains: a multi-agent
               reinforcement learning algorithm that uses data from both human
               and agent games within a diverse league of continually adapting
               strategies and counter-strategies, each represented by deep
               neural networks5,6. We evaluated our agent, AlphaStar, in the
               full game of StarCraft II, through a series of online games
               against human players. AlphaStar was rated at Grandmaster level
               for all three StarCraft races and above 99.8\% of officially
               ranked human players. AlphaStar uses a multi-agent reinforcement
               learning algorithm and has reached Grandmaster level, ranking

  abstract = "A major assumption in many machine learning and data mining
              algorithms is that the training and future data must be in the
              same feature space and have the same distribution. However, in
              many real-world applications, this assumption may not hold. For
              example, we sometimes have a classification task in one domain of
              interest, but we only have sufficient training data in another
              domain of interest, where the latter data may be in a different
              feature space or follow a different data distribution. In such
              cases, knowledge transfer, if done successfully, would greatly
              improve the performance of learning by avoiding much expensive
              data-labeling efforts. In recent years, transfer learning has
              emerged as a new learning framework to address this problem. This
              survey focuses on categorizing and reviewing the current progress
              on transfer learning for classification, regression, and
              clustering problems. In this survey, we discuss the relationship
              between transfer learning and other related machine learning
              techniques such as domain adaptation, multitask learning and
              sample selection bias, as well as covariate shift. We also
              explore some potential future issues in transfer learning

  abstract  = "A long-standing goal of artificial intelligence is an algorithm
               that learns, tabula rasa, superhuman proficiency in challenging
               domains. Recently, AlphaGo became the first program to defeat a
               world champion in the game of Go. The tree search in AlphaGo
               evaluated positions and selected moves using deep neural
               networks. These neural networks were trained by supervised
               learning from human expert moves, and by reinforcement learning
               from self-play. Here we introduce an algorithm based solely on
               reinforcement learning, without human data, guidance or domain
               knowledge beyond game rules. AlphaGo becomes its own teacher: a
               neural network is trained to predict AlphaGo's own move
               selections and also the winner of AlphaGo's games. This neural
               network improves the strength of the tree search, resulting in
               higher quality move selection and stronger self-play in the next
               iteration. Starting tabula rasa, our new program AlphaGo Zero
               achieved superhuman performance, winning 100--0 against the
               previously published, champion-defeating AlphaGo. Starting from
               zero knowledge and without human data, AlphaGo Zero was able to
               teach itself to play Go and to develop novel strategies that
               provide new insights into the oldest of games. To beat world
               champions at the game of Go, the computer program AlphaGo has
               relied largely on supervised learning from millions of human
               expert moves. David Silver and colleagues have now produced a
               system called AlphaGo Zero, which is based purely on
               reinforcement learning and learns solely from self-play.
               Starting from random moves, it can reach superhuman level in
               just a couple of days of training and five million games of
               self-play, and can now beat all previous versions of AlphaGo.
               Because the machine independently discovers the same fundamental
               principles of the game that took humans millennia to
               conceptualize, the work suggests that such principles have some
               universal character, beyond human bias.",

               variability in natural signals more predictable. We therefore
               revisit and improve Contrastive Predictive Coding, an
               unsupervised objective for learning such representations. This
               new implementation produces features which support
               state-of-the-art linear classification accuracy on the ImageNet
               dataset. When used as input for non-linear classification with
               deep neural networks, this representation allows us to use 2-5x
               less labels than classifiers trained directly on image pixels.
               Finally, this unsupervised representation substantially improves
               transfer learning to object detection on the PASCAL VOC dataset,
               surpassing fully supervised pre-trained ImageNet classifiers.",

               used text on reinforcement learning, one of the most active
               research areas in artificial intelligence. Reinforcement
               learning, one of the most active research areas in artificial
               intelligence, is a computational approach to learning whereby an
               agent tries to maximize the total amount of reward it receives
               while interacting with a complex, uncertain environment. In
               Reinforcement Learning, Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto provide
               a clear and simple account of the field's key ideas and
               algorithms. This second edition has been significantly expanded
               and updated, presenting new topics and updating coverage of
               other topics. Like the first edition, this second edition
               focuses on core online learning algorithms, with the more
               mathematical material set off in shaded boxes. Part I covers as
               much of reinforcement learning as possible without going beyond
               the tabular case for which exact solutions can be found. Many
               algorithms presented in this part are new to the second edition,
               including UCB, Expected Sarsa, and Double Learning. Part II
               extends these ideas to function approximation, with new sections
               on such topics as artificial neural networks and the Fourier
               basis, and offers expanded treatment of off-policy learning and
               policy-gradient methods. Part III has new chapters on
               reinforcement learning's relationships to psychology and
               neuroscience, as well as an updated case-studies chapter
               including AlphaGo and AlphaGo Zero, Atari game playing, and IBM
               Watson's wagering strategy. The final chapter discusses the
               future societal impacts of reinforcement learning.",

  abstract  = "A Monte-Carlo evaluation consists in estimating a position by
               averaging the outcome of several random continuations. The
               method can serve as an evaluation function at the leaves of a
               min-max tree. This paper presents a new framework to combine
               tree search with Monte-Carlo evaluation, that does not separate
               between a min-max phase and a Monte-Carlo phase. Instead of
               backing-up the min-max value close to the root, and the average
               value at some depth, a more general backup operator is defined
               that progressively changes from averaging to min-max as the
               number of simulations grows. This approach provides a
               fine-grained control of the tree growth, at the level of
               individual simulations, and allows efficient selectivity. The
               resulting algorithm was implemented in a 9$\times$9 Go-playing

  abstract  = "The game of Go has long been viewed as the most challenging of
               classic games for artificial intelligence owing to its enormous
               search space and the difficulty of evaluating board positions
               and moves. Here we introduce a new approach to computer Go that
               uses `value networks' to evaluate board positions and `policy
               networks' to select moves. These deep neural networks are
               trained by a novel combination of supervised learning from human
               expert games, and reinforcement learning from games of
               self-play. Without any lookahead search, the neural networks
               play Go at the level of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tree search
               programs that simulate thousands of random games of self-play.
               We also introduce a new search algorithm that combines Monte
               Carlo simulation with value and policy networks. Using this
               search algorithm, our program AlphaGo achieved a 99.8\% winning
               rate against other Go programs, and defeated the human European
               Go champion by 5 games to 0. This is the first time that a
               computer program has defeated a human professional player in the
               full-sized game of Go, a feat previously thought to be at least
               a decade away. A computer Go program based on deep neural
               networks defeats a human professional player to achieve one of
               the grand challenges of artificial intelligence. The victory in
               1997 of the chess-playing computer Deep Blue in a six-game
               series against the then world champion Gary Kasparov was seen as
               a significant milestone in the development of artificial
               intelligence. An even greater challenge remained --- the ancient
               game of Go. Despite decades of refinement, until recently the
               strongest computers were still playing Go at the level of human
               amateurs. Enter AlphaGo. Developed by Google DeepMind, this
               program uses deep neural networks to mimic expert players, and
               further improves its performance by learning from games played
               against itself. AlphaGo has achieved a 99\% win rate against the
               strongest other Go programs, and defeated the reigning European
               champion Fan Hui 5--0 in a tournament match. This is the first
               time that a computer program has defeated a human professional
               player in even games, on a full, 19 x 19 board, in even games

               proposed reinforcement learning algorithm called TD($\lambda$)
               (Sutton, 1988), and is apparently the first application of this

               random initial weights (and hence random initial strategy),
               TD-Gammon achieves a surprisingly strong level of play. With
               zero knowledge built in at the start of learning (i.e. given

               environments. As a stepping stone to this goal, the domain of
               StarCraft has emerged as an important challenge for artificial
               intelligence research, owing to its iconic and enduring status
               among the most difficult professional esports and its relevance
               to the real world in terms of its raw complexity and multi-agent
               challenges. Over the course of a decade and numerous
               competitions1--3, the strongest agents have simplified important
               aspects of the game, utilized superhuman capabilities, or

abstract = {Dyna is an AI architecture that integrates learning, planning, and reactive execution. Learning methods are used in Dyna both for compiling planning results and for updating a model of the effects of the agent's actions on the world. Planning is incremental and can use the probabilistic and ofttimes incorrect world models generated by learning processes. Execution is fully reactive in the sense that no planning intervenes between perception and action. Dyna relies on machine learning methods for learning from examples---these are among the basic building blocks making up the architecture---yet is not tied to any particular method. This paper briefly introduces Dyna and discusses its strengths and weaknesses with respect to other architectures.},

  title    = "A Survey on Transfer Learning",
  author   = "Pan, Sinno Jialin and Yang, Qiang",
  abstract = "A major assumption in many machine learning and data mining
              algorithms is that the training and future data must be in the
              same feature space and have the same distribution. However, in
              many real-world applications, this assumption may not hold. For
              example, we sometimes have a classification task in one domain of
              interest, but we only have sufficient training data in another
              domain of interest, where the latter data may be in a different
              feature space or follow a different data distribution. In such
              cases, knowledge transfer, if done successfully, would greatly
              improve the performance of learning by avoiding much expensive
              data-labeling efforts. In recent years, transfer learning has
              emerged as a new learning framework to address this problem. This
              survey focuses on categorizing and reviewing the current progress
              on transfer learning for classification, regression, and
              clustering problems. In this survey, we discuss the relationship
              between transfer learning and other related machine learning
              techniques such as domain adaptation, multitask learning and
              sample selection bias, as well as covariate shift. We also
              explore some potential future issues in transfer learning

  abstract  = "A long-standing goal of artificial intelligence is an algorithm
               that learns, tabula rasa, superhuman proficiency in challenging
               domains. Recently, AlphaGo became the first program to defeat a
               world champion in the game of Go. The tree search in AlphaGo
               evaluated positions and selected moves using deep neural
               networks. These neural networks were trained by supervised
               learning from human expert moves, and by reinforcement learning
               from self-play. Here we introduce an algorithm based solely on
               reinforcement learning, without human data, guidance or domain
               knowledge beyond game rules. AlphaGo becomes its own teacher: a
               neural network is trained to predict AlphaGo's own move
               selections and also the winner of AlphaGo's games. This neural
               network improves the strength of the tree search, resulting in
               higher quality move selection and stronger self-play in the next
               iteration. Starting tabula rasa, our new program AlphaGo Zero
               achieved superhuman performance, winning 100--0 against the
               previously published, champion-defeating AlphaGo. Starting from
               zero knowledge and without human data, AlphaGo Zero was able to
               teach itself to play Go and to develop novel strategies that
               provide new insights into the oldest of games. To beat world
               champions at the game of Go, the computer program AlphaGo has
               relied largely on supervised learning from millions of human
               expert moves. David Silver and colleagues have now produced a
               system called AlphaGo Zero, which is based purely on
               reinforcement learning and learns solely from self-play.
               Starting from random moves, it can reach superhuman level in
               just a couple of days of training and five million games of
               self-play, and can now beat all previous versions of AlphaGo.
               Because the machine independently discovers the same fundamental
               principles of the game that took humans millennia to
               conceptualize, the work suggests that such principles have some
               universal character, beyond human bias.",

               variability in natural signals more predictable. We therefore
               revisit and improve Contrastive Predictive Coding, an
               unsupervised objective for learning such representations. This
               new implementation produces features which support
               state-of-the-art linear classification accuracy on the ImageNet
               dataset. When used as input for non-linear classification with
               deep neural networks, this representation allows us to use 2-5x
               less labels than classifiers trained directly on image pixels.
               Finally, this unsupervised representation substantially improves
               transfer learning to object detection on the PASCAL VOC dataset,

  abstract = "We survey various task transfer methods in Qlearning and present
              a variation on fixed sub-transfer which we call dynamic
              sub-transfer. We discuss the benefits and drawbacks of dynamic
              sub-transfer as compared with the other transfer methods, and we
              describe qualitatively the situations where this method would be
              preferred over the fixed version of sub-transfer. We test this
              method against several other transfer methods in a simple three
              room grid world where portions of the source's policy are
              relevant to the target task and other portions are not. In this
              situation we found that dynamic sub-transfer converged to the
              optimal solution, avoiding the suboptimality inherent in fixed
              sub-transfer, while also avoiding some of the convergence
              problems often experienced by fixed sub-transfer.",

Empirical results have suggested that Model-based Interval Estimation (MBIE) learns efficiently in practice, effectively balancing exploration and exploitation.

  abstract  = "In many real-world scenarios, rewards extrinsic to the agent are
               extremely sparse, or absent altogether. In such cases, curiosity
               can serve as an intrinsic reward signal to enable the agent to
               explore its environment and learn skills that might be useful
               later in its life. We formulate curiosity as the error in an
               agent's ability to predict the consequence of its own actions in
               a visual feature space learned by a self-supervised inverse
               dynamics model. Our formulation scales to high-dimensional
               continuous state spaces like images, bypasses the difficulties
               of directly predicting pixels, and, critically, ignores the
               aspects of the environment that cannot affect the agent. The
               proposed approach is evaluated in two environments: VizDoom and
               Super Mario Bros. Three broad settings are investigated: 1)
               sparse extrinsic reward, where curiosity allows for far fewer
               interactions with the environment to reach the goal; 2)
               exploration with no extrinsic reward, where curiosity pushes the
               agent to explore more efficiently; and 3) generalization to
               unseen scenarios (e.g. new levels of the same game) where the
               knowledge gained from earlier experience helps the agent explore
               new places much faster than starting from scratch.",

              state-of-the-art, general purpose deep reinforcementlearning
              agents. Deep reinforcement learning methods attain super-human

              grossly inefficient, often taking orders of magnitudes more data

              able to rapidly assimilate new experiences and act upon them. Our
              agent uses a semi-tabular representation of the value function: a
              buffer of past experience containing slowly changing state
              representations and rapidly updated estimates of the value

               s, using parameters $\vartheta$. In this paper we introduce
               universal value function approximators (UVFAs) V(s,g;theta) that
               generalise not just over states s but also over goals g. We
               develop an efficient technique for supervised learning of UVFAs,
               by factoring observed values into separate embedding vectors for
               state and goal, and then learning a mapping from s and g to
               these factored embedding vectors. We show how this technique may
               be incorporated into a reinforcement learning algorithm that
               updates the UVFA solely from observed rewards. Finally, we
               demonstrate that a UVFA can successfully generalise to
