	Abstract = {Infants{\textquoteright} remarkable learning abilities allow them to rapidly acquire many complex skills. It has been suggested that infants achieve this learning by optimally allocating their attention to relevant stimuli in the environment, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we modeled infants{\textquoteright} looking behavior during a learning task through an ideal learner that quantified the informational structure of environmental stimuli. We show that saccadic latencies, looking time, and time spent engaged with a stimulus sequence are explained by the properties of the learning environments, including the level of surprise of the stimulus, overall predictability of the environment, and progress in learning the environmental structure. These findings reveal the factors that shape infants{\textquoteright} advanced learning, emphasizing their predisposition to seek out stimuli that maximize learning.},

@article{gesturelanguage,
	Abstract = {Two experiments investigated gesture as a form of external support for spoken language comprehension. In both experiments, children selected blocks according to a set of videotaped instructions. Across trials, the instructions were given using no gesture, gestures that reinforced speech, and gestures that conflicted with speech. Experiment 1 used spoken messages that were complex for preschool children but not for kindergarten children. Reinforcing gestures facilitated speech comprehension for preschool children but not for kindergarten children, and conflicting gestures hindered comprehension for kindergarten children but not for preschool children. Experiment 2 tested preschool children with simpler spoken messages. Unlike Experiment 1, preschool children's comprehension was not facilitated by reinforcing gestures. However, children's comprehension also was not hindered by conflicting gestures. Thus, the effects of gesture on speech comprehension depend both on the relation of gesture to speech, and on the complexity of the spoken message.},

 title="{TAMER}: {T}raining an {A}gent {M}anually via {E}valuative {R}einforcement",
 booktitle="IEEE 7th International Conference on Development and Learning",
 month="August",
 year="2008",
 abstract={Though computers have surpassed humans at many tasks, especially
  computationally intensive ones, there are many tasks for which human
  expertise remains necessary and/or useful.  For such tasks, it is
  desirable for a human to be able to transmit knowledge to a learning
  agent as quickly and effortlessly as possible, and, ideally, without
  any knowledge of the details of the agent's learning process.  This
  paper proposes a general framework called Training an Agent
  Manually via Evaluative Reinforcement (TAMER) that allows a human to
  train a learning agent to perform a common class of complex tasks
  simply by giving scalar reward signals in response to the agent's
  observed actions.  Specifically, in sequential decision making tasks,
  an agent models the human's reward function and chooses actions that
  it predicts will receive the most reward.  Our novel algorithm is
  fully implemented and tested on the game Tetris.  Leveraging the human
  trainers' feedback, the agent learns to clear an average of more than
  50 lines by its third game, an order of magnitude faster than the best
  autonomous learning agents.},

@article{toolmaking,
	Abstract = {Hominin reliance on Oldowan stone tools---which appear from 2.5 mya and are believed to have been socially transmitted---has been hypothesized to have led to the evolution of teaching and language. Here we present an experiment investigating the efficacy of transmission of Oldowan tool-making skills along chains of adult human participants (N=184) using five different transmission mechanisms. Across six measures, transmission improves with teaching, and particularly with language, but not with imitation or emulation. Our results support the hypothesis that hominin reliance on stone tool-making generated selection for teaching and language, and imply that (i) low-fidelity social transmission, such as imitation/emulation, may have contributed to the \~{}700,000 year stasis of the Oldowan technocomplex, and (ii) teaching or proto-language may have been pre-requisites for the appearance of Acheulean technology. This work supports a gradual evolution of language, with simple symbolic communication preceding behavioural modernity by hundreds of thousands of years.},

  abstract = { In this paper, a model predictive path integral control algorithm based on a generalized importance sampling scheme is developed and parallel optimization via sampling is performed using a graphics processing unit. The proposed generalized importance sampling scheme allows for changes in the drift and diffusion terms of stochastic diffusion processes and plays a significant role in the performance of the model predictive control algorithm. The proposed algorithm is compared in simulation with a model predictive control version of differential dynamic programming on nonlinear systems. Finally, the proposed algorithm is applied on multiple vehicles for the task of navigating through a cluttered environment. The current simulations illustrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed approach and demonstrate the advantages of computational frameworks that incorporate concepts from statistical physics, control theory, and parallelization against more traditional approaches of optimal control theory. }

    abstract = 	 {Many machine learning tasks, such as learning with invariance and policy evaluation in reinforcement learning, can be characterized as problems of learning from conditional distributions. In such problems, each sample x itself is associated with a conditional distribution $p(z|x)$ represented by samples $z_i_i=1^M$, and the goal is to learn a function f that links these conditional distributions to target values y. These problems become very challenging when we only have limited samples or in the extreme case only one sample from each conditional distribution. Commonly used approaches either assume that z is independent of x, or require an overwhelmingly large set of samples from each conditional distribution.   To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach which employs a new min-max reformulation of the learning from conditional distribution problem.  With such new reformulation, we only need to deal with the joint distribution p(z,x). We also design an efficient learning algorithm, Embedding-SGD, and establish theoretical sample complexity for such problems. Finally, our numerical experiments, on both synthetic and real-world datasets, show that the proposed approach can significantly improve over existing algorithms.}

    abstract = {Current model-based reinforcement learning methods struggle when operating from complex visual scenes due to
    their inability to prioritize task-relevant features. To mitigate this problem, we propose learning Task Informed
    Abstractions (TIA) that explicitly separates reward-correlated visual features from distractors. For learning TIA, we
    introduce the formalism of Task Informed MDP (TiMDP) that is realized by training two models that learn visual features
    via cooperative reconstruction, but one model is adversarially dissociated from the reward signal. Empirical evaluation
    shows that TIA leads to significant performance gains over state-of-the-art methods on many visual control tasks where
    natural and unconstrained visual distractions pose a formidable challenge. Project page: https://xiangfu.co/tia}

    abstract = 	 {Many reinforcement learning (RL) tasks provide the agent with high-dimensional observations that can be simplified into low-dimensional continuous states. To formalize this process, we introduce the concept of a \texit{DeepMDP}, a parameterized latent space model that is trained via the minimization of two tractable latent space losses: prediction of rewards and prediction of the distribution over next latent states. We show that the optimization of these objectives guarantees (1) the quality of the embedding function as a representation of the state space and (2) the quality of the DeepMDP as a model of the environment. Our theoretical findings are substantiated by the experimental result that a trained DeepMDP recovers the latent structure underlying high-dimensional observations on a synthetic environment. Finally, we show that learning a DeepMDP as an auxiliary task in the Atari 2600 domain leads to large performance improvements over model-free RL.}

  abstract = 	 {In real-world reinforcement learning applications the learner’s observation space is ubiquitously high-dimensional with both relevant and irrelevant information about the task at hand. Learning from high-dimensional observations has been the subject of extensive investigation in supervised learning and statistics (e.g., via sparsity), but analogous issues in reinforcement learning are not well understood, even in finite state/action (tabular) domains. We introduce a new problem setting for reinforcement learning, the Exogenous Markov Decision Process (ExMDP), in which the state space admits an (unknown) factorization into a small controllable (or, endogenous) component and a large irrelevant (or, exogenous) component; the exogenous component is independent of the learner’s actions, but evolves in an arbitrary, temporally correlated fashion. We provide a new algorithm, OSSR, which learns a near-optimal policy with sample complexity polynomial in the size of the endogenous component and nearly independent of the size of the exogenous component, thereby offering a doubly-exponential improvement over off-the-shelf algorithms. Our results highlight for the first time that sample-efficient reinforcement learning is possible in the presence of exogenous information, and provide a simple, user-friendly benchmark for investigation going forward.}
