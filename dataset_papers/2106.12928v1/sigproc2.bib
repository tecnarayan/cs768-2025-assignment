abstract ={The question of what role sex plays in evolution is still open despite decades of research. It has often been assumed that sex should facilitate the increase in fitness. Hence, the fact that it may break down highly favorable genetic combinations has been seen as a problem. Here, we consider an alternative approach. We define a measure that represents the ability of alleles to perform well across different combinations and, using numerical iterations within a classical population-genetic framework, show that selection in the presence of sex favors this ability in a highly robust manner. We also show that the mechanism responsible for this effect has been out of the purview of previous theory, because it operates during the evolutionary transient, and that the breaking down of favorable genetic combinations is an integral part of it. Implications of these results and more to evolutionary theory are discussed.},

abstract ={Even the most seasoned students of evolution, starting with Darwin
himself, have occasionally expressed amazement that the mechanism of natural
selection has produced the whole of Life as we see it around us. There is a
computational way to articulate the same amazement: ``What algorithm could
possibly achieve all this in a mere three and a half billion years?" In this
paper we propose an answer: We demonstrate that in the regime of weak
selection, the standard equations of population genetics describing natural
selection in the presence of sex become identical to those of a repeated game
between genes played according to multiplicative weight updates (MWUA), an
algorithm known in computer science to be surprisingly powerful and versatile.
MWUA maximizes a tradeoff between cumulative performance and entropy, which
suggests a new view on the maintenance of diversity in evolution.}, URL =

  abstract={A spiking neuron circuit based on a carbon nanotube (CNT) transistor is presented in this paper. The spiking neuron circuit has a crossbar architecture in which the transistor gates are connected to its row electrodes and the transistor sources are connected to its column electrodes. An electrochemical cell is incorporated in the gate of the transistor by sandwiching a hydrogen-doped poly(ethylene glycol)methyl ether (PEG) electrolyte between the CNT channel and the top gate electrode. An input spike applied to the gate triggers a dynamic drift of the hydrogen ions in the PEG electrolyte, resulting in a post-synaptic current (PSC) through the CNT channel. Spikes input into the rows trigger PSCs through multiple CNT transistors, and PSCs cumulate in the columns and integrate into a  circuit to trigger output spikes based on an integrate-and-fire mechanism. The spiking neuron circuit can potentially emulate biological neuron networks and their intelligent functions.}

abstract ={We investigate the problem of learning to play the game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. Each player attempts to improve her/his average score by adjusting the frequency of the three possible responses, using reinforcement learning. For the zero sum game the learning process displays Hamiltonian chaos. Thus, the learning trajectory can be simple or complex, depending on initial conditions. We also investigate the non-zero sum case and show that it can give rise to chaotic transients. This is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of Hamiltonian chaos in learning a basic two-person game, extending earlier findings of chaotic attractors in dissipative systems. As we argue here, chaos provides an important self-consistency condition for determining when players will learn to behave as though they were fully rational. That chaos can occur in learning a simple game indicates one should use caution in assuming real people will learn to play a game according to a Nash equilibrium strategy.},
