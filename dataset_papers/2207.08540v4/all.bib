abstract = {Sampling methods (e.g., node-wise, layer-wise, or subgraph) has become an indispensable strategy to speed up training large-scale Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, existing sampling methods are mostly based on the graph structural information and ignore the dynamicity of optimization, which leads to high variance in estimating the stochastic gradients. The high variance issue can be very pronounced in extremely large graphs, where it results in slow convergence and poor generalization. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the variance of sampling methods and show that, due to the composite structure of empirical risk, the variance of any sampling method can be decomposed intoembedding approximation variance in the forward stage andstochastic gradient variance in the backward stage that necessities mitigating both types of variance to obtain faster convergence rate. We propose a decoupled variance reduction strategy that employs (approximate) gradient information to adaptively sample nodes with minimal variance, and explicitly reduces the variance introduced by embedding approximation. We show theoretically and empirically that the proposed method, even with smaller mini-batch sizes, enjoys a faster convergence rate and entails a better generalization compared to the existing methods.},

  abstract = {The ability to learn tasks in a sequential fashion is crucial to the
development of artificial intelligence. Neural networks are not, in general,
capable of this and it has been widely thought that catastrophic forgetting is
an inevitable feature of connectionist models. We show that it is possible to
overcome this limitation and train networks that can maintain expertise on
tasks which they have not experienced for a long time. Our approach remembers
old tasks by selectively slowing down learning on the weights important for
those tasks. We demonstrate our approach is scalable and effective by solving a
set of classification tasks based on the MNIST hand written digit dataset and
by learning several Atari 2600 games sequentially.},

abstract = {One major obstacle towards AI is the poor ability of models to solve new problems quicker, and without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. To better understand this issue, we study the problem of continual learning, where the model observes, once and one by one, examples concerning a sequence of tasks. First, we propose a set of metrics to evaluate models learning over a continuum of data. These metrics characterize models not only by their test accuracy, but also in terms of their ability to transfer knowledge across tasks. Second, we propose a model for continual learning, called Gradient Episodic Memory (GEM) that alleviates forgetting, while allowing beneficial transfer of knowledge to previous tasks. Our experiments on variants of the MNIST and CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate the strong performance of GEM when compared to the state-of-the-art.},

In this article, we propose a new approach for classification, called the import vector machine (IVM), which is built on kernel logistic regression (KLR). We show that the IVM not only performs as well as the SVM in two-class classification, but also can naturally be generalized to the multiclass case. Furthermore, the IVM provides an estimate of the underlying probability. Similar to the support points of the SVM, the IVM model uses only a fraction of the training data to index kernel basis functions, typically a much smaller fraction than the SVM. This gives the IVM a potential computational advantage over the SVM.",

abstract = { We describe an approach to domain adaptation that is appropriate exactly in the case when one has enough ``target'' data to do slightly better than just using only ``source'' data. Our approach is incredibly simple, easy to implement as a preprocessing step (10 lines of Perl!) and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on a range of datasets. The technique comes with several simple theoretical guarantees. Moreover, it is trivially extended to a multi-domain adaptation problem, where one has data from a variety of different domains. },
