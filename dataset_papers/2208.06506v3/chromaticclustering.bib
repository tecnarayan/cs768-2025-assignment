	abstract = { Abstract In forming teams or groups, one often aims to balance expertise in a main focus area while also encouraging diversity of skills in each team. In this paper we model the problem of finding diverse groups of individuals who have expertise in a given task as a clustering problem on hypergraphs with heterogeneous edge types. Here, the hyperedge types encode past experience types of groups, and the output of the clustering is groups of individuals (nodes). Unlike complementary problems that seek to find fair or balanced clusters (e.g., in terms of some protected node attributes), our model encourages diversity of past experience within these groups by striking a balance between experience and diversity with respect to node participation in edge types. We show that naive objectives lead to no diversity-experience tradeoff, which motivates our refined model based on regularizing an edge-based hypergraph clustering objective. While optimizing our objective is NP-hard, we design a 2-approximation algorithm that works for a more general class of problems where each node is allowed to have a preference for a particular cluster, and illustrate a technique for computing regularization strength bounds that reveal meaningful diversity/experience tradeoff regimes. We illustrate the utility of our framework on several real-life datasets – most notably to online review platform data – to curate sets of reviews for a given type of product which exhibit a tradeoff between reviewer experience, or familiarity with a product type, and experience, or the reviewer's tendency to also review related product types. In the setting allowing for node preferences, we show that our framework discovers sets of reviews sensitive to user preference. }

abstract =  {Many graph-based learning problems can be cast as finding a good set of vertices nearby a seed set, and a powerful methodology for these problems is based on minimum cuts and maximum flows. We introduce and analyze a new method for locally-biased graph-based learning called SimpleLocal, which finds good conductance cuts near a set of seed vertices. An important feature of our algorithm is that it is strongly-local, meaning it does not need to explore the entire graph to find cuts that are locally optimal. This method is related to other strongly-local flow-based methods, but it enables a simple implementation. We also show how it achieves localization through an implicit l1-norm penalty term. As a flow-based method, our algorithm exhibits several advantages in terms of cut optimality and accurate identification of target regions in a graph. We demonstrate the power of SimpleLocal solving segmentation problems on a 467 million edge graph based on an MRI scan.},

Cutsets of hypergraphs are defined in a natural way, and it is shown that optimal cutsets can be found by means of a network flow computation. The optimal cutset computation can be used to generate a family of subsets of nodes, which we call LS sets. Intuitively, an LS set is a subset of nodes that are more strongly connected to each other than to nodes in the complementary set. LS sets are useful for constructing optimal or near-optimal partitions of the nodes. A polynomial-bounded partitioning algorithm is presented, and various applications are suggested.},

Of course such models have to simulate the given hypergraphs with respect to their cut properties. An edge-weighted graph (V, E) is a cut-model for an edge-weighted hypergraph (V, H) if the weight of the edges cut by any bipartition of V in the graph is the same as the weight of the hyperedges cut by the same bipartition in the hypergraph. We show that there is no cut-model in general. Next we examine whether the addition of dummy vertices helps: An edge-weighted graph (V ∪ D, E) is a mincut-model for an edge-weighted hypergraph (V, H) if the weight of the hyperedges cut by a bipartition of the hypergraphs vertices is the same as the weight of a minimum cut separating the two parts in the graph. We construct such models using positive and negative weights. On the other hand, we show that there is no mincut-model in general if only positive weights are allowed.},

abstract = {Given an undirected graph with edge costs and a subset of k nodes called terminals, a multiway cut is a subset of edges whose removal disconnects each terminal from the rest. Multiway Cut is the problem of finding a multiway cut of minimum cost. Previously, a very simple combinatorial algorithm due to Dahlhaus, Johnson, Papadimitriou, Seymour, and Yannakakis gave a performance guarantee of 2(1−1k). In this paper, we present a new linear programming relaxation for Multiway Cut and a new approximation algorithm based on it. The algorithm breaks the threshold of 2 for approximating Multiway Cut, achieving a performance ratio of at most 1.5−1k. This improves the previous result for every value of k. In particular, for k=3 we get a ratio of 76<43.},

abstract  = {Correlation clustering is an approach for clustering a set of objects from given pairwise information. In this approach, the given pairwise information is usually represented by an undirected graph with nodes corresponding to the objects, where each edge in the graph is assigned a nonnegative weight, and either the positive or negative label. Then, a clustering is obtained by solving an optimization problem of finding a partition of the node set that minimizes the disagreement or maximizes the agreement with the pairwise information. In this paper, we extend correlation clustering with disagreement minimization to deal with higher-order relationships represented by hypergraphs. We give two pivoting algorithms based on a linear programming relaxation of the problem. One achieves an                                                                           {\$}{\$}O(k {\backslash}log n){\$}{\$}                -approximation, where n is the number of nodes and k is the maximum size of hyperedges with the negative labels. This algorithm can be applied to any hyperedges with arbitrary weights. The other is an O(r)-approximation for complete r-partite hypergraphs with uniform weights. This type of hypergraphs arise from the coclustering setting of correlation clustering.},

abstract = {A signed graph is a graph with a sign attached to each arc. This article introduces the matroids of signed graphs, which generalize both the polygon matroids and the even-circle (or unoriented cycle) matroids of ordinary graphs. The concepts of balance, switching, restriction and contraction, double covering graphs, and linear representation of signed graphs are treated in terms of the matroid, and a matrix-tree theorem for signed graphs is proved. The examples treated include the all-positive and all-negative graphs (whose matroids are the polygon and even-circle matroids), sign-symmetric graphs (related to the classical root systems), and signed complete graphs (equivalent to two-graphs). Replacing the sign group by an arbitrary group leads to voltage graphs. Most of our results on signed graphs extend to all voltage graphs.},

abstract  = {There is growing interest in the complex topology of human brain functional networks, often measured using resting-state functional MRI (fMRI). Here, we used a meta-analysis of the large primary literature that used fMRI or PET to measure task-related activation (\&gt;1,600 studies; 1985{\textendash}2010). We estimated the similarity (Jaccard index) of the activation patterns across experimental tasks between each pair of 638 brain regions. This continuous coactivation matrix was used to build a weighted graph to characterize network topology. The coactivation network was modular, with occipital, central, and default-mode modules predominantly coactivated by specific cognitive domains (perception, action, and emotion, respectively). It also included a rich club of hub nodes, located in parietal and prefrontal cortex and often connected over long distances, which were coactivated by a diverse range of experimental tasks. Investigating the topological role of edges between a deactivated and an activated node, we found that such competitive interactions were most frequent between nodes in different modules or between an activated rich-club node and a deactivated peripheral node. Many aspects of the coactivation network were convergent with a connectivity network derived from resting state fMRI data (n = 27, healthy volunteers); although the connectivity network was more parsimoniously connected and differed in the anatomical locations of some hubs. We conclude that the community structure of human brain networks is relevant to cognitive function. Deactivations may play a role in flexible reconfiguration of the network according to cognitive demand, varying the integration between modules, and between the periphery and a central rich club.},
