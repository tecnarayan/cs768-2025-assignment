  abstract={Control methods based on sEMG obtained promising results for hand prosthetics. Control system robustness is still often inadequate and does not allow the amputees to perform a large number of movements useful for everyday life. Only few studies analyzed the repeatability of sEMG classification of hand grasps. The main goals of this paper are to explore repeatability in sEMG data and to release a repeatability database with the recorded experiments. The data are recorded from 10 intact subjects repeating 7 grasps 12 times, twice a day for 5 days. The data are publicly available on the Ninapro web page. The analysis for the repeatability is based on the comparison of movement classification accuracy in several data acquisitions and for different subjects. The analysis is performed using mean absolute value and waveform length features and a Random Forest classifier. The accuracy obtained by training and testing on acquisitions at different times is on average 27.03\% lower than training and testing on the same acquisition. The results obtained by training and testing on different acquisitions suggest that previous acquisitions can be used to train the classification algorithms. The inter-subject variability is remarkable, suggesting that specific characteristics of the subjects can affect repeatibility and sEMG classification accuracy. In conclusion, the results of this paper can contribute to develop more robust control systems for hand prostheses, while the presented data allows researchers to test repeatability in further analyses.},

    abstract = {Hand prostheses controlled by surface electromyography are promising due to the non-invasive approach and the control capabilities offered by machine learning. Nevertheless, dexterous prostheses are still scarcely spread due to control difficulties, low robustness and often prohibitive costs. Several sEMG acquisition setups are now available, ranging in terms of costs between a few hundred and several thousand dollars. The objective of this paper is the relative comparison of six acquisition setups on an identical hand movement classification task, in order to help the researchers to choose the proper acquisition setup for their requirements. The acquisition setups are based on four different sEMG electrodes (including Otto Bock, Delsys Trigno, Cometa Wave + Dormo ECG and two Thalmic Myo armbands) and they were used to record more than 50 hand movements from intact subjects with a standardized acquisition protocol. The relative performance of the six sEMG acquisition setups is compared on 41 identical hand movements with a standardized feature extraction and data analysis pipeline aimed at performing hand movement classification. Comparable classification results are obtained with three acquisition setups including the Delsys Trigno, the Cometa Wave and the affordable setup composed of two Myo armbands. The results suggest that practical sEMG tests can be performed even when costs are relevant (e.g. in small laboratories, developing countries or use by children). All the presented datasets can be used for offline tests and their quality can easily be compared as the data sets are publicly available.},

abstract = {In this paper we present our results on using electromyographic (EMG) sensor arrays for finger gesture recognition. Sensing muscle activity allows to capture finger motion without placing sensors directly at the hand or fingers and thus may be used to build unobtrusive body-worn interfaces. We use an electrode array with 192 electrodes to record a high-density EMG of the upper forearm muscles. We present in detail a baseline system for gesture recognition on our dataset, using a naive Bayes classifier to discriminate the 27 gestures. We recorded 25 sessions from 5 subjects. We report an average accuracy of 90\% for the within-session scenario, showing the feasibility of the EMG approach to discriminate a large number of subtle gestures. We analyze the effect of the number of used electrodes on the recognition performance and show the benefit of using high numbers of electrodes. Cross-session recognition typically suffers from electrode position changes from session to session. We present two methods to estimate the electrode shift between sessions based on a small amount of calibration data and compare it to a baseline system with no shift compensation. The presented methods raise the accuracy from 59\% baseline accuracy to 75\% accuracy after shift compensation. The dataset is publicly available.},

Here, we demonstrate a BMI controlled by individual motor units non-invasively recorded from the biceps brachii. Through real-time auditory and visual neurofeedback of motor unit activity, 8 participants learned to skillfully and independently control three motor units in order to complete a two-dimensional center-out task, with marked improvements in control over 6 days of training. Concomitantly, dimensionality of the motor unit population increased significantly relative to naturalistic behaviors, largely violating recruitment orders displayed during stereotyped, isometric muscle contractions. Finally, participants demonstrated the potential of a motor unit BMI to power general applications by navigating a virtual keyboard in a spelling task, achieving performances comparable to spelling-tailored non-invasive BMIs that leverage less flexible control strategies to improve performance. These results highlight a largely unexplored level of flexibility of the sensorimotor system and show that this can be exploited to create a versatile, skillfully-controllable non-invasive BMI that has great potential to both provide translational benefit and augment motor functions.Competing Interest StatementE.F. and P.B. acted as participants of the study.

	abstract = {Since the advent of computing, humans have sought computer input technologies that are expressive, intuitive, and universal. While diverse modalities have been developed, including keyboards, mice, and touchscreens, they require interaction with an intermediary device that can be limiting, especially in mobile scenarios. Gesture-based systems utilize cameras or inertial sensors to avoid an intermediary device, but they tend to perform well only for unobscured or overt movements. Brain computer interfaces (BCIs) have been imagined for decades to solve the interface problem by allowing for input to computers via thought alone. However high-bandwidth communication has only been demonstrated using invasive BCIs with decoders designed for single individuals, and so cannot scale to the general public. In contrast, neuromotor signals found at the muscle offer access to subtle gestures and force information. Here we describe the development of a noninvasive neuromotor interface that allows for computer input using surface electromyography (sEMG). We developed a highly-sensitive and robust hardware platform that is easily donned/doffed to sense myoelectric activity at the wrist and transform intentional neuromotor commands into computer input. We paired this device with an infrastructure optimized to collect training data from thousands of consenting participants, which allowed us to develop generic sEMG neural network decoding models that work across many people without the need for per-person calibration. Test users not included in the training set demonstrate closed-loop median performance of gesture decoding at 0.5 target acquisitions per second in a continuous navigation task, 0.9 gesture detections per second in a discrete gesture task, and handwriting at 17.0 adjusted words per minute. We demonstrate that input bandwidth can be further improved up to 30\% by personalizing sEMG decoding models to the individual, anticipating a future in which humans and machines co-adapt to provide seamless translation of human intent. To our knowledge this is the first high-bandwidth neuromotor interface that directly leverages biosignals with performant out-of-the-box generalization across people.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Decoding speech from brain activity is a long-awaited goal in both healthcare and neuroscience. Invasive devices have recently led to major milestones in this regard: deep-learning algorithms trained on intracranial recordings can now start to decode elementary linguistic features such as letters, words and audio-spectrograms. However, extending this approach to natural speech and non-invasive brain recordings remains a major challenge. Here we introduce a model trained with contrastive learning to decode self-supervised representations of perceived speech from the non-invasive recordings of a large cohort of healthy individuals. To evaluate this approach, we curate and integrate four public datasets, encompassing 175 volunteers recorded with magneto-encephalography or electro-encephalography while they listened to short stories and isolated sentences. The results show that our model can identify, from 3 seconds of magneto-encephalography signals, the corresponding speech segment with up to 41{\%} accuracy out of more than 1,000 distinct possibilities on average across participants, and with up to 80{\%} in the best participants---a performance that allows the decoding of words and phrases absent from the training set. The comparison of our model with a variety of baselines highlights the importance of a contrastive objective, pretrained representations of speech and a common convolutional architecture simultaneously trained across multiple participants. Finally, the analysis of the decoder's predictions suggests that they primarily depend on lexical and contextual semantic representations. Overall, this effective decoding of perceived speech from non-invasive recordings delineates a promising path to decode language from brain activity, without putting patients at risk of brain surgery.},

	abstract = {Speech neuroprostheses have the potential to restore communication to people living with paralysis, but naturalistic speed and expressivity are elusive1. Here we use high-density surface recordings of the speech cortex in a clinical-trial participant with severe limb and vocal paralysis to achieve high-performance real-time decoding across three complementary speech-related output modalities: text, speech audio and facial-avatar animation. We trained and evaluated deep-learning models using neural data collected as the participant attempted to silently speak sentences. For text, we demonstrate accurate and rapid large-vocabulary decoding with a median rate of 78 words per minute and median word error rate of 25{\%}. For speech audio, we demonstrate intelligible and rapid speech synthesis and personalization to the participant's pre-injury voice. For facial-avatar animation, we demonstrate the control of virtual orofacial movements for speech and non-speech communicative gestures. The decoders reached high performance with less than two weeks of training. Our findings introduce a multimodal speech-neuroprosthetic approach that has substantial promise to restore full, embodied communication to people living with severe paralysis.},

In the classic “What the frog's eye tells the frog's brain,” Lettvin and colleagues [1] showed that different types of retinal ganglion cell send specific kinds of information. For example, one type responds best to a dark, convex form moving centripetally (a fly). Here we consider a complementary question: how much information does the retina send and how is it apportioned among different cell types? Recording from guinea pig retina on a multi-electrode array and presenting various types of motion in natural scenes, we measured information rates for seven types of ganglion cell. Mean rates varied across cell types (6–13 bits · s−1) more than across stimuli. Sluggish cells transmitted information at lower rates than brisk cells, but because of trade-offs between noise and temporal correlation, all types had the same coding efficiency. Calculating the proportions of each cell type from receptive field size and coverage factor, we conclude (assuming independence) that the approximately 105 ganglion cells transmit on the order of 875,000 bits · s−1. Because sluggish cells are equally efficient but more numerous, they account for most of the information. With approximately 106 ganglion cells, the human retina would transmit data at roughly the rate of an Ethernet connection.}

The scale of the data enables powerful statistical analyses on the correlation between typing performance and various factors, such as demographics, finger usage, and use of intelligent text entry techniques. We report effects of age and finger usage on performance that correspond to previous studies. We also find evidence of relationships between performance and use of intelligent text entry techniques: auto-correct usage correlates positively with entry rates, whereas word prediction usage has a negative correlation.
