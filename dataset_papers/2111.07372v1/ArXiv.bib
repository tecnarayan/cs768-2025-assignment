year = {2016},
abstract = {Gibbs sampling is a {M}arkov chain {M}onte {C}arlo technique commonly used for estimating marginal distributions. To speed up {G}ibbs sampling, there has recently been interest in parallelizing it by executing asynchronously. While empirical results suggest that many models can be efficiently sampled asynchronously, traditional {M}arkov chain analysis does not apply to the asynchronous case, and thus asynchronous {G}ibbs sampling is poorly understood. In this paper, we derive a better understanding of the two main challenges of asynchronous Gibbs: bias and mixing time. We show experimentally that our theoretical results match practical outcomes.},

 abstract = {Consider a family of distributions {πβ} where X ∼ πβ means that ℙ(X = x) = exp(−βH(x))/Z(β). Here Z(β) is the proper normalizing constant, equal to Σx exp(−βH(x)). Then {πβ} is known as a {G}ibbs distribution, and Z(β) is the partition function. This work presents a new method for approximating the partition function to a specified level of relative accuracy using only a number of samples, that is, O(ln(Z(β)) ln(ln(Z(β)))) when Z(0) ≥ 1. This is a sharp improvement over previous, similar approaches that used a much more complicated algorithm, requiring O(ln(Z(β)) ln(ln(Z(β)))5) samples.},
