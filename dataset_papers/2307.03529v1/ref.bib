abstract = {There has been a flurry of recent literature studying streaming algorithms for which the input stream is chosen adaptively by a black-box adversary who observes the output of the streaming algorithm at each time step. However, these algorithms fail when the adversary has access to the internal state of the algorithm, rather than just the output of the algorithm.We study streaming algorithms in the white-box adversarial model, where the stream is chosen adaptively by an adversary who observes the entire internal state of the algorithm at each time step. We show that nontrivial algorithms are still possible. We first give a randomized algorithm for the L1-heavy hitters problem that outperforms the optimal deterministic Misra-Gries algorithm on long streams. If the white-box adversary is computationally bounded, we use cryptographic techniques to reduce the memory of our L1-heavy hitters algorithm even further and to design a number of additional algorithms for graph, string, and linear algebra problems. The existence of such algorithms is surprising, as the streaming algorithm does not even have a secret key in this model, i.e., its state is entirely known to the adversary. One algorithm we design is for estimating the number of distinct elements in a stream with insertions and deletions achieving a multiplicative approximation and sublinear space; such an algorithm is impossible for deterministic algorithms.We also give a general technique that translates any two-player deterministic communication lower bound to a lower bound for randomized algorithms robust to a white-box adversary. In particular, our results show that for all p≥0, there exists a constant Cp>1 such that any Cp-approximation algorithm for Fp moment estimation in insertion-only streams with a white-box adversary requires Ω(n) space for a universe of size n. Similarly, there is a constant C>1 such that any C-approximation algorithm in an insertion-only stream for matrix rank requires Ω(n) space with a white-box adversary. These results do not contradict our upper bounds since they assume the adversary has unbounded computational power. Our algorithmic results based on cryptography thus show a separation between computationally bounded and unbounded adversaries.Finally, we prove a lower bound of Ω(log(n)) bits for the fundamental problem of deterministic approximate counting in a stream of 0s and 1s, which holds even if we know how many total stream updates we have seen so far at each point in the stream. Such a lower bound for approximate counting with additional information was previously unknown, and in our context, it shows a separation between multiplayer deterministic maximum communication and the white-box space complexity of a streaming algorithm.},

abstract = {We investigate the adversarial robustness of streaming algorithms. In this context, an algorithm is considered robust if its performance guarantees hold even if the stream is chosen adaptively by an adversary that observes the outputs of the algorithm along the stream and can react in an online manner. While deterministic streaming algorithms are inherently robust, many central problems in the streaming literature do not admit sublinear-space deterministic algorithms; on the other hand, classical space-efficient randomized algorithms for these problems are generally not adversarially robust. This raises the natural question of whether there exist efficient adversarially robust (randomized) streaming algorithms for these problems. In this work, we show that the answer is positive for various important streaming problems in the insertion-only model, including distinct elements and more generally $F_p$-estimation, Fp-heavy hitters, entropy estimation, and others. For all of these problems, we develop adversarially robust (1+ε)-approximation algorithms whose required space matches that of the best known non-robust algorithms up to a poly(log n, 1/ε) multiplicative factor (and in some cases even up to a constant factor). Towards this end, we develop several generic tools allowing one to efficiently transform a non-robust streaming algorithm into a robust one in various scenarios.},

Plugging in known dynamic fractional matching algorithms into our framework, we obtain numerous randomized dynamic matching algorithms which work against adaptive adversaries. In contrast, all previous randomized algorithms for this problem assumed a weaker, oblivious, adversary. Our dynamic algorithms against adaptive adversaries include, for any constant є >0, a (2+є)-approximate algorithm with constant update time or polylog worst-case update time, as well as (2−δ)-approximate algorithms in bipartite graphs with arbitrarily-small polynomial update time. All these results achieve polynomially better update time to approximation trade-offs than previously known to be achievable against adaptive adversaries.},

This improves on the previous fastest algorithm: the deterministic ~O(4n)-time and ~O(2n)-space algorithm of Micciancio and Voulgaris (STOC 2010, SIAM J. Comp. 2013). In fact, we give a conceptually simple algorithm that solves the (in our opinion, even more interesting) problem of discrete Gaussian sampling (DGS). More specifically, we show how to sample 2n/2 vectors from the discrete Gaussian distribution at any parameter in 2n+o(n) time and space. (Prior work only solved DGS for very large parameters.) Our SVP result then follows from a natural reduction from SVP to DGS.In addition, we give a more refined algorithm for DGS above the so-called smoothing parameter of the lattice, which can generate 2n/2 discrete Gaussian samples in just 2n/2+o(n) time and space. Among other things, this implies a 2n/2+o(n)-time and space algorithm for 1.93-approximate decision SVP.},

This improves on the previous fastest algorithm, the deterministic ~{O}(4n)-time and ~{O}(2n)-space algorithm of Micciancio and Voulgaris. We achieve our main result in three steps. First, we show how to modify the sampling algorithm due to Aggarwal, Dadush, Regev, and Stephens-Davidowitz (ADRS) to solve the problem of discrete Gaussian sampling over lattice shifts, L-t, with very low parameters. While the actual algorithm is a natural generalization of ADRS, the analysis uses substantial new ideas. This yields a 2n+o(n)-time algorithm for approximate CVP with the very good approximation factor γ = 1+2-o(n/log n). Second, we show that the approximate closest vectors to a target vector can be grouped into "lower-dimensional clusters," and we use this to obtain a recursive reduction from exact CVP to a variant of approximate CVP that "behaves well with these clusters." Third, we show that our discrete Gaussian sampling algorithm can be used to solve this variant of approximate CVP. The analysis depends crucially on some new properties of the discrete Gaussian distribution and approximate closest vectors, which might be of independent interest.},

    abstract = { The affine rank minimization problem consists of finding a matrix of minimum rank that satisfies a given system of linear equality constraints. Such problems have appeared in the literature of a diverse set of fields including system identification and control, Euclidean embedding, and collaborative filtering. Although specific instances can often be solved with specialized algorithms, the general affine rank minimization problem is NP-hard because it contains vector cardinality minimization as a special case. In this paper, we show that if a certain restricted isometry property holds for the linear transformation defining the constraints, the minimum-rank solution can be recovered by solving a convex optimization problem, namely, the minimization of the nuclear norm over the given affine space. We present several random ensembles of equations where the restricted isometry property holds with overwhelming probability, provided the codimension of the subspace is sufficiently large. The techniques used in our analysis have strong parallels in the compressed sensing framework. We discuss how affine rank minimization generalizes this preexisting concept and outline a dictionary relating concepts from cardinality minimization to those of rank minimization. We also discuss several algorithmic approaches to minimizing the nuclear norm and illustrate our results with numerical examples. }

The main question left open (and explicitly asked) by AMS in 1996 is to give the precise characterization for which functions G on frequency vectors mi (1≤ i ≤ n) can Σi∈ [n] G(mi) be approximated efficiently, where "efficiently" means by a single pass over data stream and poly-logarithmic memory. No such characterization was known despite a tremendous amount of research on frequency-based functions in streaming literature. In this paper we finally resolve the AMS main question and give a precise characterization (in fact, a zero-one law) for all monotonically increasing functions on frequencies that are zero at the origin.That is, we consider all monotonic functions G: R → R such that G(0) = 0 and G can be computed in poly-logarithmic time and space and ask, for which G in this class is there an (1±ε)-approximation algorithm for computing Σi∈ [n] G(mi) for any polylogarithmic ε?We give an algebraic characterization for all such G so that: For all functions G in our class that satisfy our algebraic condition, we provide a very general and constructive way to derive an efficient (1±ε)-approximation algorithm for computing Σi∈ [n] G(mi) with polylogarithmic memory and a single pass over data stream; while: For all functions G in our class that do not satisfy our algebraic characterization, we show a lower bound that requires greater then polylog memory for computing an approximation to Σi∈ [n] G(mi) by any one-pass streaming algorithm.Thus, we provide a zero-one law for all monotonically increasing functions G which are zero at the origin. Our results are quite general. As just one illustrative example, our main theorem implies a lower bound for G(x) =(x(x-1))0.5arctan(x+1), while for a function G(x) =(x(x+1))0.5arctan(x+1) our main theorem automatically yields a polylog memory one-pass (1±ε)-approximation algorithm for computing Σi∈ [n] G(mi). For both of these examples no lower or upper bounds were known. Of course, these are just illustrative examples, and there are many others. One might argue that these two functions may not be of interest in practical applications -- we stress that our law works for all functions in this class, and the above examples illustrate the power of our method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first zero-one law in the streaming model for a wide class of functions, though we suspect that there are many more such laws to be discovered. Surprisingly, our upper bound requires only 4-wise independence and does not need the stronger machinery of Nisan's pseudorandom generators, even though our class captures multiple functions that previously required Nisan's generators. Furthermore, we believe that our methods can be extended to the more general models and complexity classes. For instance, the law also holds for a smaller class of non-decreasing and symmetric functions (i.e., G(x) = G(-x) and G(0) = 0) which, due to negative values, allow deletions.},

abstract = {This article is about a curious phenomenon. Suppose we have a data matrix, which is the superposition of a low-rank component and a sparse component. Can we recover each component individually? We prove that under some suitable assumptions, it is possible to recover both the low-rank and the sparse components exactly by solving a very convenient convex program called Principal Component Pursuit; among all feasible decompositions, simply minimize a weighted combination of the nuclear norm and of the ℓ1 norm. This suggests the possibility of a principled approach to robust principal component analysis since our methodology and results assert that one can recover the principal components of a data matrix even though a positive fraction of its entries are arbitrarily corrupted. This extends to the situation where a fraction of the entries are missing as well. We discuss an algorithm for solving this optimization problem, and present applications in the area of video surveillance, where our methodology allows for the detection of objects in a cluttered background, and in the area of face recognition, where it offers a principled way of removing shadows and specularities in images of faces.},

    abstract = { Suppose we are given a matrix that is formed by adding an unknown sparse matrix to an unknown low-rank matrix. Our goal is to decompose the given matrix into its sparse and low-rank components. Such a problem arises in a number of applications in model and system identification and is intractable to solve in general. In this paper we consider a convex optimization formulation to splitting the specified matrix into its components by minimizing a linear combination of the ℓ1 norm and the nuclear norm of the components. We develop a notion of rank-sparsity incoherence, expressed as an uncertainty principle between the sparsity pattern of a matrix and its row and column spaces, and we use it to characterize both fundamental identifiability as well as (deterministic) sufficient conditions for exact recovery. Our analysis is geometric in nature with the tangent spaces to the algebraic varieties of sparse and low-rank matrices playing a prominent role. When the sparse and low-rank matrices are drawn from certain natural random ensembles, we show that the sufficient conditions for exact recovery are satisfied with high probability. We conclude with simulation results on synthetic matrix decomposition problems. }

The algorithm reads some number of uniformly distributed random digits in a given base and generates an initial portion of the representation of a normal deviate in the same base. Thereafter, uniform random digits are copied directly into the representation of the normal deviate. Thus, in contrast to existing methods, it is possible to generate normal deviates exactly rounded to any precision with a mean cost that scales linearly in the precision. The method performs no extended precision arithmetic, calls no transcendental functions, and uses no floating point arithmetic whatsoever; it uses only simple integer operations. It can easily be adapted to sample exactly from the discrete normal distribution whose parameters are rational numbers.},

In the paradigm we suggest, a practical protocol P is produced by first devising and proving correct a protocol PR for the random oracle model, and then replacing oracle accesses by the computation of an “appropriately chosen” function h. This paradigm yields protocols much more efficient than standard ones while retaining many of the advantages of provable security. We illustrate these gains for problems including encryption, signatures, and zero-knowledge proofs.},

abstract="We describe an RSA-based signing scheme which combines essentially optimal efficiency with attractive security properties. Signing takes one RSA decryption plus some hashing, verification takes one RSA encryption plus some hashing, and the size of the signature is the size of the modulus. Assuming the underlying hash functions are ideal, our schemes are not only provably secure, but are so in a tight way---an ability to forge signatures with a certain amount of computational resources implies the ability to invert RSA (on the same size modulus) with about the same computational effort. Furthermore, we provide a second scheme which maintains all of the above features and in addition provides message recovery. These ideas extend to provide schemes for Rabin signatures with analogous properties; in particular their security can be tightly related to the hardness of factoring.",

abstract = {One of the oldest problems in the data stream model is to approximate the p-th moment (Vert mathbf {X}Vert _p^p = sum _{i=1}^n mathbf {X}_i^p ) of an underlying non-negative vector (mathbf {X} in mathbb {R}^n ) , which is presented as a sequence of poly(n) updates to its coordinates. Of particular interest is when p ∈ (0, 2]. Although a tight space bound of Θ(ϵ− 2log n) bits is known for this problem when both positive and negative updates are allowed, surprisingly there is still a gap in the space complexity of this problem when all updates are positive. Specifically, the upper bound is O(ϵ− 2log n) bits, while the lower bound is only Ω(ϵ− 2 + log n) bits. Recently, an upper bound of (tilde{O}(epsilon ^{-2} + log n) ) bits was obtained under the assumption that the updates arrive in a random order. We show that for p ∈ (0, 1], the random order assumption is not needed. Namely, we give an upper bound for worst-case streams of (tilde{O}(epsilon ^{-2} + log n) ) bits for estimating (Vert mathbf {X}Vert _p^p ) . Our techniques also give new upper bounds for estimating the empirical entropy in a stream. On the other hand, we show that for p ∈ (1, 2], in the natural coordinator and blackboard distributed communication topologies, there is an (tilde{O}(epsilon ^{-2}) ) bit max-communication upper bound based on a randomized rounding scheme. Our protocols also give rise to protocols for heavy hitters and approximate matrix product. We generalize our results to arbitrary communication topologies G, obtaining an (tilde{O}(epsilon ^{2} log d) ) max-communication upper bound, where d is the diameter of G. Interestingly, our upper bound rules out natural communication complexity-based approaches for proving an Ω(ϵ− 2log n) bit lower bound for p ∈ (1, 2] for streaming algorithms. In particular, any such lower bound must come from a topology with large diameter.},

journal={ProQuest Dissertations and Theses},
pages={167},
abstract={Pseudorandom functions (PRFs) are efficiently computable, deterministic functions that are computationally indistinguishable from a truly random function. These functions are fundamental objects in cryptography that serve as a core building block in many cryptographic algorithms and protocols. In recent years, many extensions to the traditional notion of pseudorandom functions were proposed in cryptography. These advanced variants not only satisfy the traditional security property of a PRF, but also provide additional structures or functionalities that further expand the pool of applications of pseudorandom functions.It was initially believed that any constructions of these advanced variants of pseudorandom functions require strong cryptographic hardness assumptions such as the existence of multilinear maps or indistinguishability obfuscation. However, in this work, we show that one can construct a large family of these variants by relying on much weaker hardness assumptions. We provide three new constructions of advanced pseudorandom functions. Our first construction is a new key-homomorphic PRF that requires the hardness of the Learning with Errors (LWE) problem with only a polynomial-size modulus. Previous constructions required the hardness of LWE with a superpolynomial-size modulus, which is a much stronger hardness assumption. Next, we construct a private puncturable PRF that relies only on the hardness of LWE. Prior constructions required existence of multilinear maps or indistinguishability obfuscation. Finally, we construct a watermarkable PRF from LWE. All prior constructions required the existence of indistinguishability obfuscation.},
