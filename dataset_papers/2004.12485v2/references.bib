Recent advances in areas such as microfluidics-assisted chemical synthesis and biological testing, as well as artificial intelligence systems that improve a design hypothesis through feedback analysis, are now providing a basis for the introduction of greater automation into aspects of this process. This could potentially accelerate time frames for compound discovery and optimization and enable more effective searches of chemical space. However, such approaches also raise considerable conceptual, technical and organizational challenges, as well as scepticism about the current hype around them. This article aims to identify the approaches and technologies that could be implemented robustly by medicinal chemists in the near future and to critically analyse the opportunities and challenges for their more widespread application.},

In this context, exploring completely the large space of potential materials is computationally intractable. Here, we review methods for achieving inverse design, which aims to discover tailored materials from the starting point of a particular desired functionality. Recent advances from the rapidly growing field of artificial intelligence, mostly from the subfield of machine learning, have resulted in a fertile exchange of ideas, where approaches to inverse molecular design are being proposed and employed at a rapid pace. Among these, deep generative models have been applied to numerous classes of materials: rational design of prospective drugs, synthetic routes to organic compounds, and optimization of photovoltaics and redox flow batteries, as well as a variety of other solid-state materials.},

Our primary contribution is the direct realization of molecular graphs, a task previously approached by generating linear SMILES strings instead of graphs. Our junction tree variational autoencoder generates molecular graphs in two phases, by first generating a tree-structured scaffold over chemical substructures, and then combining them into a molecule with a graph message passing network. This approach allows us to incrementally expand molecules while maintaining chemical validity at every step. We evaluate our model on multiple tasks ranging from molecular generation to optimization. Across these tasks, our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin.}

	abstract = {ConspectusComputer-aided synthesis planning (CASP) is focused on the goal of accelerating the process by which chemists decide how to synthesize small molecule compounds. The ideal CASP program would take a molecular structure as input and output a sorted list of detailed reaction schemes that each connect that target to purchasable starting materials via a series of chemically feasible reaction steps. Early work in this field relied on expert-crafted reaction rules and heuristics to describe possible retrosynthetic disconnections and selectivity rules but suffered from incompleteness, infeasible suggestions, and human bias. With the relatively recent availability of large reaction corpora (such as the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), Reaxys, and SciFinder databases), consisting of millions of tabulated reaction examples, it is now possible to construct and validate purely data-driven approaches to synthesis planning. As a result, synthesis planning has been opened to machine learning techniques, and the field is advancing rapidly.In this Account, we focus on two critical aspects of CASP and recent machine learning approaches to both challenges. First, we discuss the problem of retrosynthetic planning, which requires a recommender system to propose synthetic disconnections starting from a target molecule. We describe how the search strategy, necessary to overcome the exponential growth of the search space with increasing number of reaction steps, can be assisted through a learned synthetic complexity metric. We also describe how the recursive expansion can be performed by a straightforward nearest neighbor model that makes clever use of reaction data to generate high quality retrosynthetic disconnections. Second, we discuss the problem of anticipating the products of chemical reactions, which can be used to validate proposed reactions in a computer-generated synthesis plan (i.e., reduce false positives) to increase the likelihood of experimental success. While we introduce this task in the context of reaction validation, its utility extends to the prediction of side products and impurities, among other applications. We describe neural network-based approaches that we and others have developed for this forward prediction task that can be trained on previously published experimental data.Machine learning and artificial intelligence have revolutionized a number of disciplines, not limited to image recognition, dictation, translation, content recommendation, advertising, and autonomous driving. While there is a rich history of using machine learning for structure–activity models in chemistry, it is only now that it is being successfully applied more broadly to organic synthesis and synthesis design. As reported in this Account, machine learning is rapidly transforming CASP, but there are several remaining challenges and opportunities, many pertaining to the availability and standardization of both data and evaluation metrics, which must be addressed by the community at large.},

Progress in automated synthesis of organic compounds has been proceeding along parallel tracks. One goal is algorithmic prediction of viable routes to a desired compound; the other is implementation of a known reaction sequence on a platform that needs little to no human intervention. Coley et al. now report preliminary integration of these two protocols. They paired a retrosynthesis prediction algorithm with a robotically reconfigurable flow apparatus. Human intervention was still required to supplement the predictor with practical considerations such as solvent choice and precise stoichiometry, although predictions should improve as accessible data accumulate for training.

Structured Abstract
INTRODUCTIONThe ability to synthesize complex organic molecules is essential to the discovery and manufacture of functional compounds, including small-molecule medicines. Despite advances in laboratory automation, the identification and development of synthetic routes remain a manual process and experimental synthesis platforms must be manually configured to suit the type of chemistry to be performed, requiring time and effort investment from expert chemists. The ideal automated synthesis platform would be capable of planning its own synthetic routes and executing them under conditions that facilitate scale-up to production goals. Individual elements of the chemical development process (design, route development, experimental configuration, and execution) have been streamlined in previous studies, but none has presented a path toward integration of computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP), expert refined chemical recipe generation, and robotically executed chemical synthesis.
RATIONALEWe describe an approach toward automated, scalable synthesis that combines techniques in artificial intelligence (AI) for planning and robotics for execution. Millions of previously published reactions inform the computational design of synthetic routes; expert-refined chemical recipe files (CRFs) are run on a robotic flow chemistry platform for scalable, reproducible synthesis. This development strategy augments a chemist’s ability to approach target-oriented flow synthesis while substantially reducing the necessary information gathering and manual effort.
RESULTSWe developed an open source software suite for CASP trained on millions of reactions from the Reaxys database and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The software was designed to generalize known chemical reactions to new substrates by learning to apply retrosynthetic transformations, to identify suitable reaction conditions, and to evaluate whether reactions are likely to be successful when attempted experimentally. Suggested routes partially populate CRFs, which require additional details from chemist users to define residence times, stoichiometries, and concentrations that are compatible with continuous flow. To execute these syntheses, a robotic arm assembles modular process units (reactors and separators) into a continuous flow path according to the desired process configuration defined in the CRF. The robot also connects reagent lines and computer-controlled pumps to reactor inlets through a fluidic switchboard. When that is completed, the system primes the lines and starts the synthesis. After a specified synthesis time, the system flushes the lines with a cleaning solvent, and the robotic arm disconnects reagent lines and removes process modules to their appropriate storage locations.This paradigm of flow chemistry development was demonstrated for a suite of 15 medicinally relevant small molecules. In order of increasing complexity, we investigated the synthesis of aspirin and secnidazole run back to back; lidocaine and diazepam run back to back to use a common feedstock; (S)-warfarin and safinamide to demonstrate the planning program’s stereochemical awareness; and two compound libraries: a family of five ACE inhibitors including quinapril and a family of four nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs including celecoxib. These targets required a total of eight particular retrosynthetic routes and nine specific process configurations.
CONCLUSIONThe software and platform herein represent a milestone on the path toward fully autonomous chemical synthesis, where routes still require human input and process development. Over time, the results generated by this and similar automated experimental platforms may reduce our reliance on historical reaction data, particularly in combination with smaller-scale flow-screening platforms. Increased availability of reaction data will further enable robotically realized syntheses based on AI recommendations, relieving expert chemists of manual tasks so that they may focus on new ideas. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/365/6453/eaax1566/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Planning and execution.A robotically reconfigurable flow chemistry platform performs multistep chemical syntheses planned in part by AI.
The synthesis of complex organic molecules requires several stages, from ideation to execution, that require time and effort investment from expert chemists. Here, we report a step toward a paradigm of chemical synthesis that relieves chemists from routine tasks, combining artificial intelligence–driven synthesis planning and a robotically controlled experimental platform. Synthetic routes are proposed through generalization of millions of published chemical reactions and validated in silico to maximize their likelihood of success. Additional implementation details are determined by expert chemists and recorded in reusable recipe files, which are executed by a modular continuous-flow platform that is automatically reconfigured by a robotic arm to set up the required unit operations and carry out the reaction. This strategy for computer-augmented chemical synthesis is demonstrated for 15 drug or drug-like substances.

	Abstract = {To plan the syntheses of small organic molecules, chemists use retrosynthesis, a problem-solving technique in which target molecules are recursively transformed into increasingly simpler precursors. Computer-aided retrosynthesis would be a valuable tool but at present it is slow and provides results of unsatisfactory quality. Here we use Monte Carlo tree search and symbolic artificial intelligence (AI) to discover retrosynthetic routes. We combined Monte Carlo tree search with an expansion policy network that guides the search, and a filter network to pre-select the most promising retrosynthetic steps. These deep neural networks were trained on essentially all reactions ever published in organic chemistry. Our system solves for almost twice as many molecules, thirty times faster than the traditional computer-aided search method, which is based on extracted rules and hand-designed heuristics. In a double-blind AB test, chemists on average considered our computer-generated routes to be equivalent to reported literature routes.},

These individual components were combined to an overall score of synthetic accessibility by an additive scheme. The weights of the scoring function components were calculated by linear regression analysis based on accessibility scores derived from medicinal chemists. The calculated values for synthetic accessibility agree with the values proposed by chemists to an extent that compares well with how chemists agree with each other.",

This framework is useful in applications such as drug discovery, where an algorithm recommends new candidate molecules; these molecules first need to be synthesized and then tested for drug-like properties. The algorithm uses the results of past tests to recommend new ones so as to find good molecules efficiently. Most existing data-driven methods for this problem do not account for sample efficiency and/or fail to enforce realistic constraints on synthesizability. In this work, we explore existing kernels for molecules in the literature as well as propose a novel kernel which views a molecule as a graph. In ChemBO, we implement these kernels in a Gaussian process model. Then we explore the chemical space by traversing possible paths of molecular synthesis. Consequently, our approach provides a proposal synthesis path every time it recommends a new molecule to test, a crucial advantage when compared to existing methods. In our experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach on several molecular optimization problems.},
