The next query is chosen according to the principle of maximal disagreement. The algorithm is studied for two toy models: the high-low game and perceptron learning of another perceptron. As the number of queries goes to infinity, the committee algorithm yields asymptotically finite information gain. This leads to generalization error that decreases exponentially with the number of examples. This in marked contrast to learning from randomly chosen inputs, for which the information gain approaches zero and the generalization error decreases with a relatively slow inverse power law. We suggest that asymptotically finite information gain may be an important characteristic of good query algorithms.},

  abstract  = {Generating a description of an image is called image captioning. Image captioning requires recognizing the important objects, their attributes, and their relationships in an image. It also needs to generate syntactically and semantically correct sentences. Deep-learning-based techniques are capable of handling the complexities and challenges of image captioning. In this survey article, we aim to present a comprehensive review of existing deep-learning-based image captioning techniques. We discuss the foundation of the techniques to analyze their performances, strengths, and limitations. We also discuss the datasets and the evaluation metrics popularly used in deep-learning-based automatic image captioning.},
