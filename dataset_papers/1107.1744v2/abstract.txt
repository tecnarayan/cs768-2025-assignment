This paper addresses the problem of minimizing a convex, Lipschitz function
$f$ over a convex, compact set $\xset$ under a stochastic bandit feedback
model. In this model, the algorithm is allowed to observe noisy realizations of
the function value $f(x)$ at any query point $x \in \xset$. The quantity of
interest is the regret of the algorithm, which is the sum of the function
values at algorithm's query points minus the optimal function value. We
demonstrate a generalization of the ellipsoid algorithm that incurs
$\otil(\poly(d)\sqrt{T})$ regret. Since any algorithm has regret at least
$\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ on this problem, our algorithm is optimal in terms of the
scaling with $T$.
