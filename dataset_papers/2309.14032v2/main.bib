 @article{Gonzalez-Pardo_2017, title={Comparative study of pheromone control heuristics in ACO algorithms for solving RCPSP problems}, volume={60}, ISSN={1568-4946}, DOI={10.1016/j.asoc.2017.06.042}, abstractNote={Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP) belong to a kind of traditional NP-hard problems with a high impact on both research and industrial domains. The goal of these problems is to find a feasible assignment for a group of variables where a set of imposed restrictions is satisfied. This family of NP-hard problems demands a huge amount of computational resources even for their simplest cases. For this reason, different heuristic methods have been studied so far in order to discover feasible solutions at an affordable complexity level. This paper elaborates on the application of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithms with a novel CSP-graph based model to solve Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problems (RCPSP). The main drawback of this ACO-based model is related to the high number of pheromones created in the system. To overcome this issue we propose two adaptive Oblivion Rate heuristics to control the number of pheromones: the first one, called Dynamic Oblivion Rate, takes into account the overall number of pheromones produced in the system, whereas the second one inspires from the recently contributed Coral Reef Optimization (CRO) solver. A thorough experimental analysis has been carried out using the public PSPLIB library, and the obtained results have been compared to those of the most relevant contributions from the related literature. The performed experiments reveal that the Oblivion Rate heuristic removes at least 79% of the pheromones in the system, whereas the ACO algorithm renders statistically better results than other algorithmic counterparts from the literature.}, journal={Applied Soft Computing}, author={Gonzalez-Pardo, Antonio and Del Ser, Javier and Camacho, David}, year={2017}, month={Nov}, pages={241–255}, language={en} }

The instances have been systematically generated by the standard project generator ProGen. They are characterized by the input-parameters of ProGen. The entire benchmark set including its detailed characterization and the best solutions known so-far are available on a public ftp-site. Hence, researchers can download the benchmark sets they need for the evaluation of their algorithms. Additionally, they can make available new results. Depending on the progress made in the field, the instance library will be continuously enlarged and new results will be made accessible.

Two decades after Tesauro’s TD-Gammon achieved near top-level human performance in backgammon, the deep reinforcement learning algorithm DQN achieved human-level performance in many Atari 2600 games. The purpose of this study is twofold. First, we propose two activation functions for neural network function approximation in reinforcement learning: the sigmoid-weighted linear unit (SiLU) and its derivative function (dSiLU). The activation of the SiLU is computed by the sigmoid function multiplied by its input. Second, we suggest that the more traditional approach of using on-policy learning with eligibility traces, instead of experience replay, and softmax action selection with simple annealing can be competitive with DQN, without the need for a separate target network. We validate our proposed approach by, first, achieving new state-of-the-art results in both stochastic SZ-Tetris and Tetris with a small 10$times$10 board, using TD($lambda$) learning and shallow dSiLU network agents, and, then, by outperforming DQN in the Atari 2600 domain by using a deep Sarsa($lambda$) agent with SiLU and dSiLU hidden units.}, note={arXiv:1702.03118 [cs]}, number={arXiv:1702.03118}, publisher={arXiv}, author={Elfwing, Stefan and Uchibe, Eiji and Doya, Kenji}, year={2017}, month={Nov} }

This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9% top-5 validation error (and 4.8% test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.}, note={arXiv:1502.03167 [cs]}, number={arXiv:1502.03167}, publisher={arXiv}, author={Ioffe, Sergey and Szegedy, Christian}, year={2015}, month={Mar} }

Several new features that are interesting for ACO in general are proposed and evaluated. In particular, the use of a combination of two pheromone evaluation methods by the ants to find new solutions, a change of the influence of the heuristic on the decisions of the ants during the run of the algorithm, and the option that an elitist ant forgets the best-found solution are studied. We tested the ACO algorithm on a set of large benchmark problems from the Project Scheduling Library. Compared to several other heuristics for the RCPSP, including genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, tabu search, and different sampling methods, our algorithm performed best on average. For nearly one-third of all benchmark problems, which were not known to be solved optimally before, the algorithm was able to find new best solutions.}, number={4}, journal={IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation}, author={Merkle, D. and Middendorf, M. and Schmeck, H.}, year={2002}, month={Aug}, pages={333–346} }

This problem is basically a combination of existing Periodic Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Window and Periodic Vehicle Routing Problem with Service Choice. We model it as a multi objective problem. To solve this problem, we develop a heuristic algorithm based on Improved Ant Colony Optimization (IACO) and Simulate Annealing (SA) called Multi Objective Simulate Annealing - Ant Colony Optimization (MOSA-ACO). Improvements are made in following respects: a) a Euclidean distance based solution acceptance criterion is developed; b) a parameter control pattern is designed to generate different initial solutions; c) several local search strategies are added. Benchmark instances generated from Solomon’s benchmark instances and Cordeau’s benchmarks instances are applied. Comparison algorithms include four population based heuristics and IACO. Computation experiment results show that MOSA-ACO algorithm has a good performance on solving this problem.},

In the PF3SACO, a new dynamic parameter adjustment mechanism by the PSO and the fuzzy system is designed to adaptively adjust the pheromone importance factor α, pheromone volatilization coefficient ρ and the heuristic function importance factor β to accelerate the convergence, improve the search ability, enhance the local search ability and avoid premature. This is achievable by parameter adaptation to reflect the dynamic search characteristic by exploring and exploiting in the search process for the parameter values to be close to the optimal values. In addition, 3-Opt algorithm is applied to optimize the generated path to eliminate the cross path, obtain the optimal path and avoid to fall into local optimum. The optimization performance of the PF3SACO is investigated on fifteen travelling salesman problems (TSPs) with the scales from 42 to 783 cities. The experiment results show that the PF3SACO has better optimization performance by comparing with ABC, NACO, HYBRID, ACO-3Opt, PACO-3Opt, PSO-ACO-3Opt and some other well-known algorithms in most TSP in term of the solution quality, robustness and space distribution. It provides a reference to solve the large-scale TSP for obtaining better path length.},
