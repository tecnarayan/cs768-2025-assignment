We propose a randomized block-coordinate variant of the classic Frank-Wolfe
algorithm for convex optimization with block-separable constraints. Despite its
lower iteration cost, we show that it achieves a similar convergence rate in
duality gap as the full Frank-Wolfe algorithm. We also show that, when applied
to the dual structural support vector machine (SVM) objective, this yields an
online algorithm that has the same low iteration complexity as primal
stochastic subgradient methods. However, unlike stochastic subgradient methods,
the block-coordinate Frank-Wolfe algorithm allows us to compute the optimal
step-size and yields a computable duality gap guarantee. Our experiments
indicate that this simple algorithm outperforms competing structural SVM
solvers.
