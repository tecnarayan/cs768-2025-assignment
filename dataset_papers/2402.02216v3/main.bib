    abstract = "We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5 (7.7 point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7{\%} (4.6{\%} absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).",

abstract = {Despite the promising representation learning of graph neural networks (GNNs), the supervised training of GNNs notoriously requires large amounts of labeled data from each application. An effective solution is to apply the transfer learning in graph: using easily accessible information to pre-train GNNs, and fine-tuning them to optimize the downstream task with only a few labels. Recently, many efforts have been paid to design the self-supervised pretext tasks, and encode the universal graph knowledge among the various applications. However, they rarely notice the inherent training objective gap between the pretext and downstream tasks. This significant gap often requires costly fine-tuning for adapting the pre-trained model to downstream problem, which prevents the efficient elicitation of pre-trained knowledge and then results in poor results. Even worse, the naive pre-training strategy usually deteriorates the downstream task, and damages the reliability of transfer learning in graph data. To bridge the task gap, we propose a novel transfer learning paradigm to generalize GNNs, namely graph pre-training and prompt tuning (GPPT). Specifically, we first adopt the masked edge prediction, the most simplest and popular pretext task, to pre-train GNNs. Based on the pre-trained model, we propose the graph prompting function to modify the standalone node into a token pair, and reformulate the downstream node classification looking the same as edge prediction. The token pair is consisted of candidate label class and node entity. Therefore, the pre-trained GNNs could be applied without tedious fine-tuning to evaluate the linking probability of token pair, and produce the node classification decision. The extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of GPPT, delivering an average improvement of 4.29\% in few-shot graph analysis and accelerating the model convergence up to 4.32X. The code is available in: https://github.com/MingChen-Sun/GPPT.},

  abstract = 	 {Learning node embeddings that capture a node‚Äôs position within the broader graph structure is crucial for many prediction tasks on graphs. However, existing Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures have limited power in capturing the position/location of a given node with respect to all other nodes of the graph. Here we propose Position-aware Graph Neural Networks (P-GNNs), a new class of GNNs for computing position-aware node embeddings. P-GNN first samples sets of anchor nodes, computes the distance of a given target node to each anchor-set, and then learns a non-linear distance-weighted aggregation scheme over the anchor-sets. This way P-GNNs can capture positions/locations of nodes with respect to the anchor nodes. P-GNNs have several advantages: they are inductive, scalable, and can incorporate node feature information. We apply P-GNNs to multiple prediction tasks including link prediction and community detection. We show that P-GNNs consistently outperform state of the art GNNs, with up to 66% improvement in terms of the ROC AUC score.}

  abstract = 	 {Recently, many works studied the expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) by linking it to the $1$-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm ($1\text{-}\mathsf{WL}$). Here, the $1\text{-}\mathsf{WL}$ is a well-studied heuristic for the graph isomorphism problem, which iteratively colors or partitions a graph‚Äôs vertex set. While this connection has led to significant advances in understanding and enhancing GNNs‚Äô expressive power, it does not provide insights into their generalization performance, i.e., their ability to make meaningful predictions beyond the training set. In this paper, we study GNNs‚Äô generalization ability through the lens of Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension theory in two settings, focusing on graph-level predictions. First, when no upper bound on the graphs‚Äô order is known, we show that the bitlength of GNNs‚Äô weights tightly bounds their VC dimension. Further, we derive an upper bound for GNNs‚Äô VC dimension using the number of colors produced by the $1\text{-}\mathsf{WL}$. Secondly, when an upper bound on the graphs‚Äô order is known, we show a tight connection between the number of graphs distinguishable by the $1\text{-}\mathsf{WL}$ and GNNs‚Äô VC dimension. Our empirical study confirms the validity of our theoretical findings.}

abstract = {In this talk, I will present a novel academic search and mining system, AMiner, the second generation of the ArnetMiner system. Different from traditional academic search systems that focus on document (paper) search, AMiner aims to provide a systematic modeling approach for researchers (authors), ultimately to gain a deep understanding of the big (heterogeneous) network formed by authors, papers they have published, and venues they published those papers. The system extracts researchers' profiles automatically from the Web and integrates the researcher profiles with publication papers after name disambiguation. For now, the system has collected a big scholar data with more than 130,000,000 researcher profiles and 100,000,000 papers from multiple publication databases. We also developed an approach named COSNET to connect AMiner with several professional social networks such as LinkedIn and VideoLectures, which significantly enriches the metadata of the scholarly data. Based on the integrated big scholar data, we devise a unified topic modeling approach for modeling the different entities (authors, papers, venues) simultaneously and provide a topic-level expertise search by leveraging the modeling results. In addition, AMiner offers a set of researcher-centered functions including social influence analysis, influence visualization, collaboration recommendation, relationship mining, similarity analysis and community evolution. The system has been put into operation since 2006 and has attracted more than 7,000,000 independent IP accesses from over 200 countries/regions.},
