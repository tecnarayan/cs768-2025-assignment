Some instances of this type have been found to be extremely hard to solve by standard methods such as branch-and-bound, even if the number of variables is as small as ten. We observe that not only the sizes of the numbers a0, a1,..., an, but also their structure, have a large impact on the difficulty of the instances. Moreover, we demonstrate that the characteristics that make the instances so difficult to solve by branch-and-bound make the solution of a certain reformulation of the problem almost trivial. We accompany our results by a small computational study.},

We select promising branching disjunctions based on a heuristic measure of disjunction quality. This measure exploits the relation between branching disjunctions and intersection cuts. In this work, we focus on disjunctions defining the mixed integer Gomory cuts at an optimal basis of the linear programming relaxation. The procedure is tested on instances from the literature. Experiments show that, for a majority of the instances, the enumeration tree obtained by branching on these general disjunctions has a smaller size than the tree obtained by branching on variables, even when variable branching is performed using full strong branching.},

In particular, we prove in the pure case that with exactly 50\% probability the k-cuts perform better variable-wise than the Gomory mixed integer cuts. Some computational experiments on knapsack problems are reported to illustrate this property.},

  abstract = {In line with the growing trend of using machine learning to help solve combinatorial optimisation problems, one promising idea is to improve node selection within a mixed integer programming (MIP) branch-and-bound tree by using a learned policy. Previous work using imitation learning indicates the feasibility of acquiring a node selection policy, by learning an adaptive node searching order. In contrast, our imitation learning policy is focused solely on learning which of a node’s children to select. We present an offline method to learn such a policy in two settings: one that comprises a heuristic by committing to pruning of nodes; one that is exact and backtracks from a leaf to guarantee finding the optimal integer solution. The former setting corresponds to a child selector during plunging, while the latter is akin to a diving heuristic. We apply the policy within the popular open-source solver SCIP, in both heuristic and exact settings. Empirical results on five MIP datasets indicate that our node selection policy leads to solutions significantly more quickly than the state-of-the-art precedent in the literature. While we do not beat the highly-optimised SCIP state-of-practice baseline node selector in terms of solving time on exact solutions, our heuristic policies have a consistently better optimality gap than all baselines, if the accuracy of the predictive model is sufficient. Further, the results also indicate that, when a time limit is applied, our heuristic method finds better solutions than all baselines in the majority of problems tested. We explain the results by showing that the learned policies have imitated the SCIP baseline, but without the latter’s early plunge abort. Our recommendation is that, despite the clear improvements over the literature, this kind of MIP child selector is better seen in a broader approach to using learning in MIP branch-and-bound tree decisions.},
