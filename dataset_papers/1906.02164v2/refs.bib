abstract="Nowadays, more and more decision procedures are supported or even guided by automated processes. An important technique in this automation is data mining. In this chapter we study how such automatically generated decision support models may exhibit discriminatory behavior towards certain groups based upon, e.g., gender or ethnicity. Surprisingly, such behavior may even be observed when sensitive information is removed or suppressed and the whole procedure is guided by neutral arguments such as predictive accuracy only. The reason for this phenomenon is that most data mining methods are based upon assumptions that are not always satisfied in reality, namely, that the data is correct and represents the population well. In this chapter we discuss the implicit modeling assumptions made by most data mining algorithms and show situations in which they are not satisfied. Then we outline three realistic scenarios in which an unbiased process can lead to discriminatory models. The effects of the implicit assumptions not being fulfilled are illustrated by examples. The chapter concludes with an outline of the main challenges and problems to be solved."

    abstract = 	 {Sampling methods that choose a subset of the data proportional to its diversity in the feature space are popular for data summarization. However, recent studies have noted the occurrence of bias {?} e.g., under or over representation of a particular gender or ethnicity {?} in such data summarization methods. In this paper we initiate a study of the problem of outputting a diverse and fair summary of a given dataset. We work with a well-studied determinantal measure of diversity and corresponding distributions (DPPs) and present a framework that allows us to incorporate a general class of fairness constraints into such distributions. Designing efficient algorithms to sample from these constrained determinantal distributions, however, suffers from a complexity barrier; we present a fast sampler that is provably good when the input vectors satisfy a natural property. Our empirical results on both real-world and synthetic datasets show that the diversity of the samples produced by adding fairness constraints is not too far from the unconstrained case.}
