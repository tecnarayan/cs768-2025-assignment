While statistics and machine learning offers numerous methods for ensuring
generalization, these methods often fail in the presence of adaptivity---the
common practice in which the choice of analysis depends on previous
interactions with the same dataset. A recent line of work has introduced
powerful, general purpose algorithms that ensure post hoc generalization (also
called robust or post-selection generalization), which says that, given the
output of the algorithm, it is hard to find any statistic for which the data
differs significantly from the population it came from.
  In this work we show several limitations on the power of algorithms
satisfying post hoc generalization. First, we show a tight lower bound on the
error of any algorithm that satisfies post hoc generalization and answers
adaptively chosen statistical queries, showing a strong barrier to progress in
post selection data analysis. Second, we show that post hoc generalization is
not closed under composition, despite many examples of such algorithms
exhibiting strong composition properties.
