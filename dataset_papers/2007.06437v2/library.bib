abstract = {Several algorithms for learning near-optimal policies in Markov Decision Processes have been analyzed and proven efficient. Empirical results have suggested that Model-based Interval Estimation (MBIE) learns efficiently in practice, effectively balancing exploration and exploitation. This paper presents a theoretical analysis of MBIE and a new variation called MBIE-EB, proving their efficiency even under worst-case conditions. The paper also introduces a new performance metric, average loss, and relates it to its less "online" cousins from the literature. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We study the problem of optimizing a function under a budgeted number of evaluations. We only assume that the function is locally smooth around one of its global optima. The difficulty of optimization is measured in terms of 1) the amount of noise b of the function evaluation and 2) the local smoothness, d, of the function. A smaller d results in smaller optimization error. We come with a new, simple, and parameter-free approach. First, for all values of b and d, this approach recovers at least the state-of-the-art regret guarantees. Second, our approach additionally obtains these results while being agnostic to the values of both b and d. This leads to the first algorithm that naturally adapts to an unknown range of noise b and leads to significant improvements in a moderate and low-noise regime. Third, our approach also obtains a remarkable improvement over the state-of-the-art SOO algorithm when the noise is very low which includes the case of optimization under deterministic feedback (b=0). There, under our minimal local smoothness assumption, this improvement is of exponential magnitude and holds for a class of functions that covers the vast majority of functions that practitioners optimize (d=0). We show that our algorithmic improvement is borne out in experiments as we empirically show faster convergence on common benchmarks.},

abstract = {Statistical performance bounds for reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can be critical for high-stakes applications like healthcare. This paper introduces a new framework for theoretically measuring the performance of such algorithms called Uniform-PAC, which is a strengthening of the classical Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) framework. In contrast to the PAC framework, the uniform version may be used to derive high probability regret guarantees and so forms a bridge between the two setups that has been missing in the literature. We demonstrate the benefits of the new framework for finite-state episodic MDPs with a new algorithm that is Uniform-PAC and simultaneously achieves optimal regret and PAC guarantees except for a factor of the horizon.},

abstract = {We present an extension of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) that strongly increases its efficiency for trees with asymmetry and/or loops. Asymmetric termination of search trees introduces a type of uncertainty for which the standard upper confidence bound (UCB) formula does not account. Our first algorithm (MCTS-T), which assumes a non-stochastic environment, backs-up tree structure uncertainty and leverages it for exploration in a modified UCB formula. Results show vastly improved efficiency in a well-known asymmetric domain in which MCTS performs arbitrarily bad. Next, we connect the ideas about asymmetric termination to the presence of loops in the tree, where the same state appears multiple times in a single trace. An extension to our algorithm (MCTS-T+), which in addition to non-stochasticity assumes full state observability, further increases search efficiency for domains with loops as well. Benchmark testing on a set of OpenAI Gym and Atari 2600 games indicates that our algorithms always perform better than or at least equivalent to standard MCTS, and could be first-choice tree search algorithms for non-stochastic, fully-observable environments.},

abstract = {We consider online learning for minimizing regret in unknown, episodic Markov decision processes (MDPs) with continuous states and actions. We develop variants of the UCRL and posterior sampling algorithms that employ nonparametric Gaussian process priors to generalize across the state and action spaces. When the transition and reward functions of the true MDP are either sampled from Gaussian process priors (fully Bayesian setting) or are members of the associated Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces of functions induced by symmetric psd kernels (frequentist setting), we show that the algorithms enjoy sublinear regret bounds. The bounds are in terms of explicit structural parameters of the kernels, namely a novel generalization of the information gain metric from kernelized bandit, and highlight the influence of transition and reward function structure on the learning performance. Our results are applicable to multi-dimensional state and action spaces with composite kernel structures, and generalize results from the literature on kernelized bandits, and the adaptive control of parametric linear dynamical systems with quadratic costs.},

abstract = {Recent advancements in model-based reinforcement learn- ing have shown that the dynamics of many structured do- mains (e.g. DBNs) can be learned with tractable sample com- plexity, despite their exponentially large state spaces. Un- fortunately, these algorithms all require access to a planner that computes a near optimal policy, and while many tra- ditional MDP algorithms make this guarantee, their com- putation time grows with the number of states. We show how to replace these over-matched planners with a class of sample-based plannerswhose computation time is indepen- dent of the number of stateswithout sacrificing the sample- efficiency guarantees of the overall learning algorithms. To do so, we define sufficient criteria for a sample-based planner to be used in such a learning system and analyze two popu- lar sample-based approaches from the literature. We also in- troduce our own sample-based planner, which combines the strategies fromthese algorithms and stillmeets the criteria for integration into our learning system. In doing so, we define the first complete RL solution for compactly represented (ex- ponentially sized) state spaces with efficiently learnable dy- namics that is both sample efficient and whose computation time does not grow rapidly with the number of states.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of planning in a stochastic and discounted environment with a limited numerical budget. More precisely, we investigate strategies exploring the set of possible sequences of actions, so that, once all available numerical resources (e.g. CPU time, number of calls to a generative model) have been used, one returns a recommendation on the best possible immediate action to follow based on this exploration. The performance of a strategy is assessed in terms of its simple regret, that is the loss in performance resulting from choosing the recommended action instead of an optimal one. We first provide a minimax lower bound for this problem, and show that a uniform planning strategy matches this minimax rate (up to a logarithmic factor). Then we propose a UCB (Upper Confidence Bounds)-based planning algorithm, called OLOP (Open-Loop Optimistic Planning), which is also minimax optimal, and prove that it enjoys much faster rates when there is a small proportion of near-optimal sequences of actions. Finally, we compare our results with the regret bounds one can derive for our setting with bandits algorithms designed for an infinite number of arms.},

@article{Munos2014,
abstract = {This work covers several aspects of the optimism in the face of uncertainty principle applied to large scale optimization problems under finite numerical budget. The initial motivation for the research reported here originated from the empirical success of the so-called Monte-Carlo Tree Search method popularized in computer-go and further extended to many other games as well as optimization and planning problems. Our objective is to contribute to the development of theoretical foundations of the field by characterizing the complexity of the underlying optimization problems and designing efficient algorithms with performance guarantees.$\backslash$nThe main idea presented here is that it is possible to decompose a complex decision making problem (such as an optimization problem in a large search space) into a sequence of elementary decisions, where each decision of the sequence is solved using a (stochastic) multi-armed bandit (simple mathematical model for decision making in stochastic environments). This so-called hierarchical bandit approach (where the reward observed by a bandit in the hierarchy is itself the return of another bandit at a deeper level) possesses the nice feature of starting the exploration by a quasi-uniform sampling of the space and then focusing progressively on the most promising area, at different scales, according to the evaluations observed so far, and eventually performing a local search around the global optima of the function. The performance of the method is assessed in terms of the optimality of the returned solution as a function of the number of function evaluations.$\backslash$nOur main contribution to the field of function optimization is a class of hierarchical optimistic algorithms designed for general search spaces$\backslash$n(such as metric spaces, trees, graphs, Euclidean spaces, ...) with different algorithmic instantiations depending on whether the evaluations are noisy or noiseless and whether some measure of the “smoothness” of the function is known or unknown. The performance of the algorithms depend on the local behavior of the function around its global optima expressed in terms of the quantity of near-optimal states measured with some metric. If this local smoothness of the function is known then one can design very efficient optimization algorithms (with convergence rate independent of the space dimension), and when it is not known, we can build adaptive techniques that can, in some cases, perform almost as well as when it is known.$\backslash$nIn order to be self-contained, we start with a brief introduction to the stochastic multi-armed bandit problem in Chapter 1 and describe the UCB (Upper Confidence Bound) strategy and several extensions. In Chapter 2 we present the Monte-Carlo Tree Search method applied to computer-go and show the limitations of previous algorithms such as UCT (UCB applied to Trees). This provides motivation for designing theoretically well-founded optimistic optimization algorithms. The main contributions on hierarchical optimistic optimization are described in Chapters 3 and 4 where the general setting of a semi-metric space is introduced and algorithms designed for optimizing a function assumed to be locally smooth (around its maxima) with respect to a$\backslash$nsemi-metric are presented and analyzed. Chapter 3 considers the case when the semi-metric is known and can be used by the algorithm,$\backslash$nwhereas Chapter 4 considers the case when it is not known and describes an adaptive technique that does almost as well as when it is known. Finally in Chapter 5 we describe optimistic strategies for a specific structured problem, namely the planning problem in Markov decision processes with infinite horizon and discounted rewards setting.},

We propose a new algorithm, TrailBlazer, able to handle MDPs with a finite or an infinite number of transitions from state-action to next states. TrailBlazer is an adaptive algorithm that exploits possible structures of the MDP by exploring only a subset of states reachable by following near-optimal policies. We provide bounds on its sample complexity that depend on a measure of the quantity of near-optimal states. The algorithm behavior can be considered as an extension of Monte-Carlo sampling (for estimating an expectation) to problems that alternate maximization (over actions) and expectation (over next states). Finally, another appealing feature of TrailBlazer is that it is simple to implement and computationally efficient.},

In the stationary version of this problem, a learner interacts with its environment by directly controlling the state transitions, attempting to balance a fixed state-dependent cost and a certain smooth cost penalizing extreme control inputs. In the current paper, we consider an online setting where the state costs may change arbitrarily between consecutive rounds, and the learner only observes the costs at the end of each respective round. We are interested in constructing algorithms for the learner that guarantee small regret against the best stationary control policy chosen in full knowledge of the cost sequence. Our main result is showing that the smoothness of the control cost enables the simple algorithm of following the leader to achieve a regret of order {\$}\backslashlog{\^{}}2 T{\$} after {\$}T{\$} rounds, vastly improving on the best known regret bound of order {\$}T{\^{}}{\{}3/4{\}}{\$} for this setting.},

abstract = {Monte-Carlo search has been successful in many non-deter- ministic games, and recently in deterministic games with high branching factor. One of the drawbacks of the current approaches is that even if the iterative process would last for a very long time, the selected move does not necessarily converge to a game-theoretic optimal one. In this paper we introduce a new algorithm, UCT, which extends a bandit algo- rithm for Monte-Carlo search. It is proven that the probability that the algorithm selects the correct move converges to 1. Moreover it is shown empirically that the algorithm converges rather fast even in comparison with alpha-beta search. Experiments in Amazons and Clobber indicate that the UCT algorithm outperforms considerably a plain Monte-Carlo version, and it is competitive against alpha-beta based game programs.},

abstract = {Based on recent results for multiarmed bandit problems, we propose an adaptive sampling algorithm that approximates the optimal value of a finite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP) with finite state and action spaces. The algorithm adaptively chooses which action to sample as the sampling process proceeds and generates an asymptotically unbiased estimator, whose bias is bounded by a quantity that converges to zero at rate ln N , where N is the total number of samples that are used per state sampled in each stage. The worst-case running-time complexity of the algorithm is OO N H , independent of the size of the state space, where A is the size of the action space and H is the horizon length. The algorithm can be used to create an approximate receding horizon control to solve infinite-horizon MDPs. To illustrate the algorithm, computational results are reported on simple examples from inventory control.},

@article{Dann2016,
abstract = {Recently, there has been significant progress in understanding reinforcement learning in discounted infinite-horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs) by deriving tight sample complexity bounds. However, in many real-world applications, an interactive learning agent operates for a fixed or bounded period of time, for example tutoring students for exams or handling customer service requests. Such scenarios can often be better treated as episodic fixed-horizon MDPs, for which only looser bounds on the sample complexity exist. A natural notion of sample complexity in this setting is the number of episodes required to guarantee a certain performance with high probability (PAC guarantee). In this paper, we derive an upper PAC bound {\$}\backslashtilde O(\backslashfrac{\{}|\backslashmathcal S|{\^{}}2 |\backslashmathcal A| H{\^{}}2{\}}{\{}\backslashepsilon{\^{}}2{\}} \backslashln\backslashfrac 1 \backslashdelta){\$} and a lower PAC bound {\$}\backslashtilde \backslashOmega(\backslashfrac{\{}|\backslashmathcal S| |\backslashmathcal A| H{\^{}}2{\}}{\{}\backslashepsilon{\^{}}2{\}} \backslashln \backslashfrac 1 {\{}\backslashdelta + c{\}}){\$} that match up to log-terms and an additional linear dependency on the number of states {\$}|\backslashmathcal S|{\$}. The lower bound is the first of its kind for this setting. Our upper bound leverages Bernstein's inequality to improve on previous bounds for episodic finite-horizon MDPs which have a time-horizon dependency of at least {\$}H{\^{}}3{\$}.},

@article{Feldman2012,
abstract = {We consider online planning in Markov decision processes (MDPs). In online planning, the agent focuses on its current state only, deliberates about the set of possible policies from that state onwards and, when interrupted, uses the outcome of that exploratory deliberation to choose what action to perform next. The performance of algorithms for online planning is assessed in terms of simple regret, which is the agent's expected performance loss when the chosen action, rather than an optimal one, is followed. To date, state-of-the-art algorithms for online planning in general MDPs are either best effort, or guarantee only polynomial-rate reduction of simple regret over time. Here we introduce a new Monte-Carlo tree search algorithm, BRUE, that guarantees exponential-rate reduction of simple regret and error probability. This algorithm is based on a simple yet non-standard state-space sampling scheme, MCTS2e, in which different parts of each sample are dedicated to different exploratory objectives. Our empirical evaluation shows that BRUE not only provides superior performance guarantees, but is also very effective in practice and favorably compares to state-of-the-art. We then extend BRUE with a variant of "learning by forgetting." The resulting set of algorithms, BRUE(alpha), generalizes BRUE, improves the exponential factor in the upper bound on its reduction rate, and exhibits even more attractive empirical performance.},

The foundational paper of (Goodfellow et al 2014) suggested they do, if they were given sufficiently large deep nets, sample size, and computation time. A recent theoretical analysis in Arora et al (to appear at ICML 2017) raised doubts whether the same holds when discriminator has finite size. It showed that the training objective can approach its optimum value even if the generated distribution has very low support ---in other words, the training objective is unable to prevent mode collapse. The current note reports experiments suggesting that such problems are not merely theoretical. It presents empirical evidence that well-known GANs approaches do learn distributions of fairly low support, and thus presumably are not learning the target distribution. The main technical contribution is a new proposed test, based upon the famous birthday paradox, for estimating the support size of the generated distribution.},

Given this wide range of applications, it is not surprising that a lot of heterogeneity exists in the way these models are formulated, trained, and evaluated. As a consequence, direct comparison between models is often difficult. This article reviews mostly known but often underappreciated properties relating to the evaluation and interpretation of generative models with a focus on image models. In particular, we show that three of the currently most commonly used criteria---average log-likelihood, Parzen window estimates, and visual fidelity of samples---are largely independent of each other when the data is high-dimensional. Good performance with respect to one criterion therefore need not imply good performance with respect to the other criteria. Our results show that extrapolation from one criterion to another is not warranted and generative models need to be evaluated directly with respect to the application(s) they were intended for. In addition, we provide examples demonstrating that Parzen window estimates should generally be avoided.},

abstract = {Gibbs sampling is a powerful technique for statistical inference. It involves little more than sampling from full conditional distributions, which can be both complex and computationally expensive to evaluate. Gilks and Wild have shown that in practice full conditionals are often log-concave, and they proposed a method of adaptive rejection sampling for efficiently sampling from univariate log-concave distributions. In this paper, to deal with non-log-concave full conditional distributions, we generalize adaptive rejection sampling to include a Hastings-Metropolis algorithm step. One important field of application in which statistical models may lead to non-log-concave full conditionals is population pharmacokinetics. Here, the relationship between drug dose and blood or plasma concentration in a group of patients typically is modelled by using non-linear mixed effects models. Often, the data used for analysis are routinely collected hospital measurements, which tend to be noisy and irregular. Consequently, a robust (t-distributed) error structure is appropriate to account for outlying observations and/or patients. We propose a robust non-linear full probability model for population pharmacokinetic data. We demonstrate that our method enables Bayesian inference for this model, through an analysis of antibiotic administration in new-born babies.},

abstract = {We study a graph bandit setting where the objective of the learner is to detect the most influential node of a graph by requesting as little information from the graph as possible. One of the relevant applications for this setting is marketing in social networks, where the marketer aims at finding and taking advantage of the most influential customers. The existing approaches for bandit problems on graphs require either partial or complete knowledge of the graph. In this paper, we do not assume any knowledge of the graph, but we consider a setting where it can be gradually discovered in a sequential and active way. At each round, the learner chooses a node of the graph and the only information it receives is a stochastic set of the nodes that the chosen node is currently influencing. To address this setting, we propose BARE, a bandit strategy for which we prove a regret guarantee that scales with the detectable dimension, a problem dependent quantity that is often much smaller than the number of nodes.},

abstract = {This paper studies the multi-agent bandit problem in a distributed networked setting. The setting considered assumes only one bandit (the major bandit) has accessible reward information from its samples, whereas the rest (the minor bandits) have unobservable rewards. Under the assumption that the minor bandits are aware of the sampling pattern of the major bandit (but with no direct access to its rewards), a lower bound on the expected average network regret is obtained. The lower bound resembles the logarithmic optimal regret attained in single (classical) bandit problems, but in addition is shown to scale down with the number of agents. A collaborative and adaptive distributed allocation rule DA is proposed and is shown to achieve the lower bound on the expected average regret for a connected inter-bandit communication network. In particular, it is shown that under the DA allocation rule, the minor bandits attain sub-logarithmic expected regrets as opposed to logarithmic in the single agent setting.},

abstract = {Decision making in robotics often involves computing an optimal action for a given state, where the space of actions under consideration can potentially be large and state dependent. Many of these decision making problems can be naturally formalized in the multiclass classification framework, where actions are regarded as labels for states. One powerful approach to multiclass classification relies on learning a function that scores each action; action selection is done by returning the action with maximum score. In this work, we focus on two imitation learning problems in particular that arise in robotics. The first problem is footstep prediction for quadruped locomotion, in which the system predicts next footstep locations greedily given the current four-foot configuration of the robot over a terrain height map. The second problem is grasp prediction, in which the system must predict good grasps of complex free-form objects given an approach direction for a robotic hand. We present experimental results of applying a recently developed functional gradient technique for optimizing a structured margin formulation of the corresponding large non-linear multiclass classification problems.},

abstract = {Most previous work on influence maximization in social networks is limited to the non-adaptive setting in which the marketer is supposed to select all of the seed users, to give free samples or discounts to, up front. A disadvantage of this setting is that the marketer is forced to select all the seeds based solely on a diffusion model. If some of the selected seeds do not perform well, there is no opportunity to course-correct. A more practical setting is the adaptive setting in which the marketer initially selects a batch of users and observes how well seeding those users leads to a diffusion of product adoptions. Based on this market feedback, she formulates a policy for choosing the remaining seeds. In this paper, we study adaptive offline strategies for two problems: (a) MAXSPREAD -- given a budget on number of seeds and a time horizon, maximize the spread of influence and (b) MINTSS -- given a time horizon and an expected number of target users to be influenced, minimize the number of seeds that will be required. In particular, we present theoretical bounds and empirical results for an adaptive strategy and quantify its practical benefit over the non-adaptive strategy. We evaluate adaptive and non-adaptive policies on three real data sets. We conclude that while benefit of going adaptive for the MAXSPREAD problem is modest, adaptive policies lead to significant savings for the MINTSS problem.},

The main advantage of HCT is that it handles the challenging case of correlated rewards, whereas existing methods require that the reward-generating process of each arm is an identically and independent distributed (iid) random process. HCT also improves on the state-of-the-art in terms of its memory requirement as well as requiring a weaker smoothness assumption on the mean-reward function in compare to the previous anytime algorithms. Finally, we discuss how HCT can be applied to the problem of policy search in reinforcement learning and we report preliminary empirical results.},

Unfortunately, finding the resulting Bayes-optimal policies is notoriously taxing, since the search space becomes enormous. In this paper we introduce a tractable, sample-based method for approximate Bayesoptimal planning which exploits Monte-Carlo tree search. Our approach outperformed prior Bayesian model-based RL algorithms by a significant margin on several well-known benchmark problems – because it avoids expensive applications of Bayes rule within the search tree by lazily sampling models from the current beliefs. We illustrate the advantages of our approach by showing it working in an infinite state space domain which is qualitatively out of reach of almost all previous work in Bayesian exploration.},

This framework is suitable for solving online learning problems that involve graphs, such as content-based recommendation. In this problem, each item we can recommend is a node and its expected rating is similar to its neighbors. The goal is to recommend items that have high expected ratings. We aim for the algorithms where the cumulative regret with respect to the optimal policy would not scale poorly with the number of nodes. In particular, we introduce the notion of an effective dimension, which is small in real-world graphs, and propose two algorithms for solving our problem that scale linearly and sublinearly in this dimension. Our experiments on real-world content recommendation problem show that a good estimator of user preferences for thousands of items can be learned from just tens of nodes evaluations.},

abstract = {We define a general framework for a large class of combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) problems, where subsets of base arms with unknown distributions form super arms. In each round, a super arm is played and the base arms contained in the super arm are played and their outcomes are observed. We further consider the extension in which more based arms could be probabilistically triggered based on the outcomes of already triggered arms. The reward of the super arm depends on the outcomes of all played arms, and it only needs to satisfy two mild assumptions, which allow a large class of nonlinear reward instances. We assume the availability of an offline ($\backslash$alpha,$\backslash$beta)-approximation oracle that takes the means of the outcome distributions of arms and outputs a super arm that with probability {\{}$\backslash$beta{\}} generates an {\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}} fraction of the optimal expected reward. The objective of an online learning algorithm for CMAB is to minimize ($\backslash$alpha,$\backslash$beta)-approximation regret, which is the difference between the $\backslash$alpha{\{}$\backslash$beta{\}} fraction of the expected reward when always playing the optimal super arm, and the expected reward of playing super arms according to the algorithm. We provide CUCB algorithm that achieves O(log n) distribution-dependent regret, where n is the number of rounds played, and we further provide distribution-independent bounds for a large class of reward functions. Our regret analysis is tight in that it matches the bound of UCB1 algorithm (up to a constant factor) for the classical MAB problem, and it significantly improves the regret bound in a earlier paper on combinatorial bandits with linear rewards. We apply our CMAB framework to two new applications, probabilistic maximum coverage and social influence maximization, both having nonlinear reward structures. In particular, application to social influence maximization requires our extension on probabilistically triggered arms.},

abstract = {We tackle the problem of online reward maximisation over a large finite set of actions described by their contexts. We focus on the case when the number of actions is too big to sample all of them even once. However we assume that we have access to the similarities between actions' contexts and that the expected reward is an arbitrary linear function of the contexts' images in the related reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). We propose KernelUCB, a kernelised UCB algorithm, and give a cumulative regret bound through a frequentist analysis. For contextual bandits, the related algorithm GP-UCB turns out to be a special case of our algorithm, and our finite-time analysis improves the regret bound of GP-UCB for the agnostic case, both in the terms of the kernel-dependent quantity and the RKHS norm of the reward function. Moreover, for the linear kernel, our regret bound matches the lower bound for contextual linear bandits.},

abstract = {Hierarchical bandits are an approach for global optimization of extremely irregular functions. This paper provides new elements regarding POO, an adaptive meta-algorithm that does not require the knowledge of local smoothness of the target function. We first highlight the fact that the subroutine algorithm used in POO should have a small regret under the assumption of local smoothness with respect to the chosen partitioning, which is unknown if it is satisfied by the standard subroutine HOO. In this work, we establish such regret guarantee for HCT, which is another hierarchical optimistic optimization algorithm that needs to know the smoothness. This confirms the validity of POO. We show that POO can be used with HCT as a subroutine with a regret upper bound that matches the one of best-known algorithms using the knowledge of smoothness up to a √ log n factor. On top of that, we propose a general wrapper, called GPO, that can cope with algorithms that only have simple regret guarantees. Finally, we complement our findings with experiments on difficult functions.},

abstract = {A critical issue for the application of Markov decision processes (MDPs) to realistic problems is how the complexity of planning scales with the size of the MDP. In stochastic environments with very large or infinite state spaces, traditional planning and reinforcement learning algorithms may be inapplicable, since their running time typically grows linearly with the state space size in the worst case. In this paper we present a new algorithm that, given only a generative model (a natural and common type of simulator) for an arbitrary MDP, performs on-line, near-optimal planning with a per-state running time that has no dependence on the number of states. The running time is exponential in the horizon time (which depends only on the discount factor $\gamma$ and the desired degree of approximation to the optimal policy). Our algorithm thus provides a different complexity trade-off than classical algorithms such as value iteration—rather than scaling linearly in both horizon time and state space size, our running time trades an exponential dependence on the former in exchange for no dependence on the latter. Our algorithm is based on the idea of sparse sampling. We prove that a randomly sampled look-ahead tree that covers only a vanishing fraction of the full look-ahead tree nevertheless suffices to compute near-optimal actions from any state of an MDP. Practical implementations of the algorithm are discussed, and we draw ties to our related recent results on finding a near-best strategy from a given class of strategies in very large partially observable MDPs.},

abstract = {Nodes in real-world networks organize into densely linked communities where edges appear with high concentration among the members of the community. Identifying such communities of nodes has proven to be a challenging task mainly due to a plethora of definitions of a community, intractability of algorithms, issues with evaluation and the lack of a reliable gold-standard ground-truth. In this paper we study a set of 230 large real-world social, collaboration and information networks where nodes explicitly state their group memberships. For example, in social networks nodes explicitly join various interest based social groups. We use such groups to define a reliable and robust notion of ground-truth communities. We then propose a methodology which allows us to compare and quantitatively evaluate how different structural definitions of network communities correspond to ground-truth communities. We choose 13 commonly used structural definitions of network communities and examine their sensitivity, robustness and performance in identifying the ground-truth. We show that the 13 structural definitions are heavily correlated and naturally group into four classes. We find that two of these definitions, Conductance and Triad-participation-ratio, consistently give the best performance in identifying ground-truth communities. We also investigate a task of detecting communities given a single seed node. We extend the local spectral clustering algorithm into a heuristic parameter-free community detection method that easily scales to networks with more than hundred million nodes. The proposed method achieves 30{\%} relative improvement over current local clustering methods.},

These methods are important components of many scientific numerical algorithms and have been demonstrated by experiment to work extremely well. In this paper, we show that spectral partitioning methods work well on bounded-degree planar graphs and finite element meshes-the classes of graphs to which they are usually applied. While naive spectral bisection does not necessarily work, we prove that spectral partitioning techniques can be used to produce separators whose ratio of vertices removed to edges cut is O (sqrt(n)) for bounded-degree planar graphs and two-dimensional meshes and O(n1/d) for well-shaped d-dimensional meshes. The heart of our analysis is an upper bound on the second-smallest eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrices of these graphs: we prove a bound of O(1/n) for bounded-degree planar graphs and O(1/n2/d) for well-shaped d-dimensional meshes. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, we develop a general framework to study the relationship between the structure of these neighbourhoods and the process of social learning. We show that, in a connected society, local learning ensures that all agents obtain the same payoffs in the long run. Thus, if actions have different payoffs, then all agents choose the same action, and social conformism obtains. We develop conditions on the distribution of prior beliefs, the structure of neighbourhoods and the informativeness of actions under which this action is optimal. In particular, we identify a property of neighbourhood structures-local independence-which greatly facilitates social learning. Simulations of the model generate spatial and temporal patterns of adoption that are consistent with empirical work.},

abstract = {Online kernel learning (OKL) is a flexible framework to approach prediction problems, since the large approximation space provided by reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces can contain an accurate function for the problem. Nonetheless, optimizing over this space is computationally expensive. Not only first order methods accumulate O( sqrt T ) more loss than the optimal function, but the curse of kernelization results in a O(t) per step complexity. Second-order methods get closer to the optimum much faster, suffering only O( log(T)) regret, but second-order updates are even more expensive, with a O(t 2) per-step cost. Existing approximate OKL methods try to reduce this complexity either by limiting the Support Vectors (SV) introduced in the predictor, or by avoiding the kernelization process altogether using embedding. Nonetheless, as long as the size of the approximation space or the number of SV does not grow over time, an adversary can always exploit the approximation process. In this paper, we propose PROS-N-KONS, a method that combines Nystrom sketching to project the input point in a small, accurate embedded space, and performs efficient second-order updates in this space. The embedded space is continuously updated to guarantee that the embedding remains accurate, and we show that the per-step cost only grows with the effective dimension of the problem and not with T . Moreover, the second-order updated allows us to achieve the logarithmic regret. We empirically compare our algorithm on recent large-scales benchmarks and show it performs favorably.},

In order to regularize solutions and keep the complexity of the algorithm bounded, we use a sequential sparsification process that admits into the kernel representation a new input sample only if its feature space image cannot be sufficiently well approximated by combining the images of previously admitted samples.

Alternative settings include active exploration, where a learner tries to gain accurate estimates of the rewards of all arms. While these objectives are contrasting, in many scenarios it is desirable to trade off rewards and errors. For instance, in educational games the designer wants to gather generalizable knowledge about the behavior of the students and teaching strategies (small estimation errors) but, at the same time, the system needs to avoid giving a bad experience to the players, who may leave the system permanently (large reward). In this paper, we formalize this tradeoff and introduce the ForcingBalance algorithm whose performance is provably close to the best possible tradeoff strategy. Finally, we demonstrate on real-world educational data that ForcingBalance returns useful information about the arms without compromising the overall reward.},

In particular, we propose Taylor expansion policy optimization , a policy optimization formalism that generalizes prior work (e.g., TRPO) as a first-order special case. We also show that Taylor expansions intimately relate to off-policy evaluation. Finally, we show that this new formulation entails modifications which improve the performance of several state-of-the-art distributed algorithms.},

This paper provides new elements regarding POO, an adaptive meta-algorithm that does not require the knowledge of local smoothness of the target function. We first highlight the fact that the sub-routine algorithm used in POO should have a small regret under the assumption of local smoothness with respect to the chosen partitioning, which is unknown if it is satisfied by the standard sub-routine HOO. In this work, we establish such regret guarantee for HCT which is another hierarchical optimistic optimization algorithm that needs to know the smoothness. This confirms the validity of POO. We show that POO can be used with HCT as a sub-routine with a regret upper bound that matches that of best-known algorithms using the knowledge of smoothness up to a sqrt(log(n)) factor.},

abstract = {We consider stochastic multi-armed bandit problems with complex actions over a set of basic arms, where the decision maker plays a complex action rather than a basic arm in each round. The reward of the complex action is some function of the basic arms' rewards, and the feedback observed may not necessarily be the reward per-arm. For instance, when the complex actions are subsets of the arms, we may only observe the maximum reward over the chosen subset. Thus, feedback across complex actions may be coupled due to the nature of the reward function. We prove a frequentist regret bound for Thompson sampling in a very general setting involving parameter, action and observation spaces and a likelihood function over them. The bound holds for discretely-supported priors over the parameter space and without additional structural properties such as closed-form posteriors, conjugate prior structure or independence across arms. The regret bound scales logarithmically with time but, more importantly, with an improved constant that non-trivially captures the coupling across complex actions due to the structure of the rewards. As applications, we derive improved regret bounds for classes of complex bandit problems involving selecting subsets of arms, including the first nontrivial regret bounds for nonlinear MAX reward feedback from subsets.},

This problem has received widespread attention in recent times, especially after the pioneering works of Emmanuel Candes and collaborators. Typically, it is assumed that the underlying matrix has low rank. This paper introduces a simple estimation procedure, called Universal Singular Value Thresholding (USVT), that works for any matrix that has `a little bit of structure'. In particular, the matrix need not be of low rank. The procedure is very simple and fast, works under minimal assumptions, and is applicable for very large matrices. Surprisingly, this simple estimator achieves the minimax error rate up to a constant factor. The method is applied to give simple solutions to difficult questions in low rank matrix estimation, blockmodels, distance matrix completion, latent space models, positive definite matrix completion, problems related to graph limits, and generalized Bradley-Terry models for pairwise comparison.},

from a set of events captured from a computer system operating under

probabilistic finite state machines that have been used to acquire
these baseline-models. Although previous research has indicated that
HMMs can effectively represent complex sequences, the traditional
learning algorithm for HMMs is too computationally expensive for
use with real-world anomaly detection systems. This paper describes
the use of a novel incremental learning algorithm for HMMs that allows
the efficient acquisition of anomaly detection models. The new learning
algorithm requires less memory and training time than previous approaches
for learning discrete HMMs and can be used to perform online learning
of accurate baseline-models from complex computer applications to
support anomaly detection.},

In this paper, we propose the multiple-play Thompson sampling (MP-TS) algorithm, an extension of TS to the multiple-play MAB problem, and discuss its regret analysis. We prove that MP-TS for binary rewards has the optimal regret upper bound that matches the regret lower bound provided by Anantharam et al. (1987). Therefore, MP-TS is the first computationally efficient algorithm with optimal regret. A set of computer simulations was also conducted, which compared MP-TS with state-of-the-art algorithms. We also propose a modification of MP-TS, which is shown to have better empirical performance.},

Alternative settings include active exploration, where a learner tries to gain accurate estimates of the rewards of all arms. While these objectives are contrasting, in many scenarios it is desirable to trade off rewards and errors. For instance, in educational games the designer wants to gather generalizable knowledge about the behavior of the students and teaching strategies (small estimation errors) but, at the same time, the system needs to avoid giving a bad experience to the players, who may leave the system permanently (large reward). In this paper, we formalize this tradeoff and introduce the ForcingBalance algorithm whose performance is provably close to the best possible tradeoff strategy. Finally, we demonstrate on real-world educational data that ForcingBalance returns useful information about the arms without compromising the overall reward.},

A key step in the implementation of importance sampling is to choose a proper distribution function from which pseudorandom numbers are generated. Parametric sampling distributions, if available at all, are often inadequate for high-dimensional integrals over irregular regions. One possible remedy is to use a nonparametric method to estimate the unknown optimal sampling function. We show that the nonparametric approach yields integral estimates that converge faster than estimates obtained from parametric approaches. We also demonstrate that an adaptive method, which has been used successfully in parametric settings, does not yield better results than simple one-step methods in the nonparametric setting.},

abstract = {Multi-armed bandit problems are the predominant theoretical model of exploration-exploitation tradeoffs in learning, and they have countless applications ranging from medical trials, to communication networks, to Web search and advertising. In many of these application domains the learner may be constrained by one or more supply (or budget) limits, in addition to the customary limitation on the time horizon. The literature lacks a general model encompassing these sorts of problems. We introduce such a model, called "bandits with knapsacks", that combines aspects of stochastic integer programming with online learning. A distinctive feature of our problem, in comparison to the existing regret-minimization literature, is that the optimal policy for a given latent distribution may significantly outperform the policy that plays the optimal fixed arm. Consequently, achieving sub linear regret in the bandits-with-knapsacks problem is significantly more challenging than in conventional bandit problems. We present two algorithms whose reward is close to the information-theoretic optimum: one is based on a novel "balanced exploration" paradigm, while the other is a primal-dual algorithm that uses multiplicative updates. Further, we prove that the regret achieved by both algorithms is optimal up to polylogarithmic factors. We illustrate the generality of the problem by presenting applications in a number of different domains including electronic commerce, routing, and scheduling. As one example of a concrete application, we consider the problem of dynamic posted pricing with limited supply and obtain the first algorithm whose regret, with respect to the optimal dynamic policy, is sub linear in the supply.},

abstract = {Training a support vector machine (SVM) leads to a quadratic optimization problem with bound constraints and one linear equality constraint. Despite the fact that this type of problem is well understood, there are many issues to be considered in designing an SVM learner. In particular, for large learning tasks with many training examples, o -the-shelf optimization techniques for general quadratic programs quickly become intractable in their memory and time requirements. S V Mlight1 is an implementation of an SVM learner which addresses the problem of large tasks. This chapter presents algorithmic and computational results developed for S V MlightV2.0, which make large-scale SVM training more practical. The results give guidelines for the application of SVMs to large domains},

We analyze the associated random observation operator, and prove that with high probability, it satisfies a form of restricted strong convexity with respect to weighted Frobenius norm. Using this property, we obtain as corol-laries a number of error bounds on matrix completion in the weighted Frobenius norm under noisy sampling and for both exact and near low-rank matrices. Our results are based on measures of the " spikiness " and " low-rankness " of matrices that are less restrictive than the incoherence con-ditions imposed in previous work. Our technique involves an M-estimator that includes controls on both the rank and spikiness of the solution, and we establish non-asymptotic error bounds in weighted Frobenius norm for recovering matrices lying with ℓ q - " balls " of bounded spikiness. Us-ing information-theoretic methods, we show that no algorithm can achieve better estimates (up to a logarithmic factor) over these same sets, showing that our conditions on matrices and associated rates are essentially optimal.},

We focus on the high-dimensional setting, where m T ? n. This includes the matrix completion problem with noise, as well as other problems. We consider linear prediction procedures based on different penalizations, involving a mixture of several norms: the nuclear norm, the Frobenius norm and the ?1-norm. For these procedures, we prove sharp oracle inequalities, using a statistical learning theory point of view. A surprising fact in our results is that the rates of convergence do not depend on m and T directly. The analysis is conducted without the usually considered incoherency condition on the unknown matrix or restricted isometry condition on the sampling operator. Moreover, our results are the first to give for this problem an analysis of penalization (such as nuclear norm penalization) as a regularization algorithm: our oracle inequalities prove that these procedures have a prediction accuracy close to the deterministic oracle one, given that the reguralization parameters are well-chosen. ? 2011 IEEE.},

@book{hastie2001elements,
abstract = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation
and information technology. With it has come vast amounts of data
in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing.
The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development
of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such
as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these
tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different
terminology. This book descibes theimprtant ideas in these areas
ina common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical,
the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples
are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It should be a vluable
resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in
science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised
learing (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include
neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and
boosting-the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book.
Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors
of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers
in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive
models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie wrote much
of the statistical modeling software in S-PLUS and invented principal
curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the Lasso and is co-author
of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman
is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS,
and projection pursuit.},

We rst characterize the set of all reward functions for which a given policy is optimal. We then derive three algorithms for IRL. The rst two deal with the case where the entire policy is known; we handle tabulated reward functions on a nite state space and linear functional approximation of the reward function over a potentially in- nite state space. The third algorithm deals with the more realistic case in which the policy is known only through a nite set of observed trajectories.

Yet, these methods require a significant amount of hyperparameters tuning in order to achieve the best results. In particular, tuning the learning rates in the stochastic optimization process is still one of the main bottlenecks. In this paper, we propose a new stochastic gradient descent procedure for deep networks that does not require any learning rate setting. Contrary to previous methods, we do not adapt the learning rates nor we make use of the assumed curvature of the objective function. Instead, we reduce the optimization process to a game of betting on a coin and propose a learning rate free optimal algorithm for this scenario. Theoretical convergence is proven for convex and quasi-convex functions and empirical evidence shows the advantage of our algorithm over popular stochastic gradient algorithms.},

We propose an algorithm which operates under the assumption that rt is large enough to warrant at least one side observation with high probability. We show that after T rounds in a bandit problem with N arms, the expected regret of our algorithm is of order O(sqrt(sum(t=1)T (1/rt) log N )), given that rt less than log T / (2N-2) for all t.

This setting naturally arises in authentication on personal computers and mobile devices, and poses additional challenges because it lacks negative examples. We formalize our problem as one-class classification, and propose and analyze an algorithm that learns a non-parametric model of the face from a single labeled image and a stream of unlabeled data. In many domains, for instance when a person interacts with a computer with a camera, unlabeled data are abundant and easy to utilize. This is the first paper that investigates how these data can help in learning better models in the single-image-per-person setting. Our method is evaluated on a dataset of 43 people and we show that these people can be recognized 90{\%} of time at nearly zero false positives.

abstract = {We present the first adaptive strategy for active learning in the setting of classification with smooth decision boundary. The problem of adaptivity (to unknown distributional parameters) has remained opened since the seminal work of Castro and Nowak (2007), which first established (active learning) rates for this setting. While some recent advances on this problem establish adaptive rates in the case of univariate data, adaptivity in the more practical setting of multivariate data has so far remained elusive. Combining insights from various recent works, we show that, for the multivariate case, a careful reduction to univariate-adaptive strategies yield near-optimal rates without prior knowledge of distributional parameters.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

@inproceedings{silver2010monte-carlo,
abstract = {This paper introduces a Monte-Carlo algorithm for online planning in large POMDPs. The algorithm combines a Monte-Carlo update of the agent's belief state with a Monte-Carlo tree search from the current belief state. The new algorithm, POMCP, has two important properties. First, Monte- Carlo sampling is used to break the curse of dimensionality both during belief state updates and during planning. Second, only a black box simulator of the POMDP is required, rather than explicit probability distributions. These properties enable POMCP to plan e ectively in signi cantly larger POMDPs than has previously been possible. We demonstrate its effectiveness in three large POMDPs. We scale up a well-known benchmark problem, rocksample, by several orders of magnitude. We also introduce two challenging new POMDPs: 10 X 10 battleship and partially observable PacMan, with approximately 10{\^{}}18 and 10{\^{}}56 states respectively. Our Monte- Carlo planning algorithm achieved a high level of performance with no prior knowledge, and was also able to exploit simple domain knowledge to achieve better results with less search. POMCP is the rst general purpose planner to achieve high performance in such large and unfactored POMDPs.},

Researchers have concentrated particularly on a few properties that seem to be common to many networks: the small-world property, power-law degree distributions, and network transitivity. In this article, we highlight another property that is found in many networks, the property of community structure, in which network nodes are joined together in tightly knit groups, between which there are only looser connections. We propose a method for detecting such communities, built around the idea of using centrality indices to find community boundaries. We test our method on computer-generated and real-world graphs whose community structure is already known and find that the method detects this known structure with high sensitivity and reliability. We also apply the method to two networks whose community structure is not well known--a collaboration network and a food web--and find that it detects significant and informative community divisions in both cases.},

IRL is motivated by situations where knowledge of the rewards is a goal by itself (as in preference elicitation) and by the task of apprenticeship learning (learning policies from an expert). In this paper we show how to combine prior knowledge and evidence from the expert's actions to derive a probability distribution over the space of reward functions. We present efficient algorithms that find solutions for the reward learning and apprenticeship learning tasks that generalize well over these distributions. Experimental results show strong improvement for our methods over previous heuristic-based approaches.},

In order to investigate the factors influencing the Laplacian spectrum of the observed graphs, we study the following complex network models: the random graph of Erd˝ os-R{\'{e}}nyi, the small- world of Watts and Strogatz and the scale-free graph, derived from a Havel-Hakimi power- law degree sequence. Along with these complex network models, we also study the correspond- ing Minimum Spanning Tree (MST). Extensive simulations show that the Laplacian spectra of complex network models differ substantially from the spectra of the observed graphs. How- ever, the Laplacian spectra of the MST in the Erd˝ os-R{\'{e}}nyi random graph with uniformly distributed link weights does bear resemblance to it. Furthermore, we discuss an extensive set of topological characteristics extracted from the Laplacian spectra of the observed real-world graphs as well as from complex network models.},

abstract = {Key processes during recruitment of Quercus petraea and Corylus avellana were investigated in abandoned calcareous grasslands and adjacent scrub using the following methods: (1) observation of hoarding animals during the main period of ripening of acorns and hazel nuts, (2) exposition of seeds on the soil surface and in 56 cm depth to test differences in predation and germination, and (3) mapping of seedlings in the grasslands. European jays (Garrulus glandarius) and mice were the main disperser of seeds. Jays preferred acorns, whereas the rodents were less selective, but probably more important for dispersal of nuts. The maximum dispersal distance was about 1020 m for mice and was estimated several hundred metres for jays. Mice collected hoards of several seeds in about 2 cm depth in the soil, whereas jays stored single seeds. Seed predation and probably hoarding by mice were highest under scrub and in unmown grassland, while jays preferred mown sites for hoarding. However, hiding of seeds in the soil reduced losses in all sites. Predation of nuts was slightly less intensive than that of acorns. Seeds of Corylus were more sensitive to desiccation than Quercus, but in both species germination was lower for seeds exposed on the soil surface and in drier sites. Quercus and Corylus were the most abundant woody species in the fallow grasslands, probably due to the effective multi-staged dispersal by jays and mice, whereas wind-dispersed and fleshy-fruited species were less common; the latter restricted to margins of adjacent scrubland. The study provides several examples for discordance in suitability of patches for seeds and seedlings due to different habitat requirements of successive developmental stages. This result emphasizes the need for studies in the multiple stages during recruitment of vertebrate-dispersed plants.},

Their applications in machine learning include summary extraction and recommendation systems. Yet, the cost of sampling from a DPP is prohibitive in large-scale applications, which has triggered an effort towards efficient approximate samplers. We build a novel MCMC sampler that combines ideas from combinatorial geometry, linear programming, and Monte Carlo methods to sample from DPPs with a fixed sample cardinality, also called projection DPPs. Our sampler leverages the ability of the hit-and-run MCMC kernel to efficiently move across convex bodies. Previous theoretical results yield a fast mixing time of our chain when targeting a distribution that is close to a projection DPP, but not a DPP in general. Our empirical results demonstrate that this extends to sampling projection DPPs, i.e., our sampler is more sample-efficient than previous approaches which in turn translates to faster convergence when dealing with costly-to-evaluate functions, such as summary extraction in our experiments.},

Thompson Sampling (TS) has surged a lot of interest due to its good empirical performance, in particular in the computational advertising. Though successful, the tools for its performance analysis appeared only recently. In this paper, we describe and analyze SpectralTS algorithm for a bandit problem, where the payoffs of the choices are smooth given an underlying graph. In this setting, each choice is a node of a graph and the expected payoffs of the neighboring nodes are assumed to be similar. Although the setting has application both in recommender systems and advertising, the traditional algorithms would scale poorly with the number of choices. For that purpose we consider an effective dimension d, which is small in real-world graphs. We deliver the analysis showing that the regret of SpectralTS scales as d√T InN with high probability, where T is the time horizon and N is the number of choices. Since a d√T InNregret is comparable to the known results, SpectralTS offers a computationally more efficient alternative. We also show that our algorithm is competitive on both synthetic and real-world data.},

Compared to previous works on bandits in general spaces (Kleinberg et al., 2008; Bubeck et al., 2011a) our algorithm does not require the knowledge of this semi-metric. Our algorithm, StoSOO, follows an optimistic strategy to iteratively construct upper confidence bounds over the hierarchical partitions of the function domain to decide which point to sample next. A finite-time analysis of StoSOO shows that it performs almost as well as the best specifically-tuned algorithms even though the local smoothness of the function is not known.},

As interest in applied mathematics has grown, the need for a text and reference offering a broad selection of topics in matrix theory has become apparent, and this book meets that need. This volume reflects two concurrent views of matrix analysis. First, it encompasses topics in linear algebra that have arisen out of the needs of mathematical analysis. Second, it is an approach to real and complex linear algebraic problems that does not hesitate to use notions from analysis. Review and miscellanea -- Eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and similarity.},

and prompts on clinicians' prescribing behavior were selected and
categorized by decision support type. Most alerts and prompts (23

the type of decision support. Some of these alerts (n = 5) reported
a positive impact on clinical and health service management outcomes.
For many categories of reminders, the number of studies was very
small and few data were available from the outpatient setting. None
of the studies evaluated features that might make alerts and prompts
more effective. Details of an updated search run in Jan 2009 are

The MaxEnt-IRL algorithm successfully integrates the maximum entropy principle into IRL and unlike its predecessors, it resolves the ambiguity arising from the fact that a possibly large number of policies could match the expert's behavior. In this paper, we study an AL setting in which in addition to the expert's trajectories, a number of unsupervised trajectories is available. We introduce MESSI, a novel algorithm that combines MaxEnt-IRL with principles coming from semi-supervised learning. In particular, MESSI integrates the unsupervised data into the MaxEnt-IRL framework using a pairwise penalty on trajectories. Empirical results in a highway driving and grid-world problems indicate that MESSI is able to take advantage of the unsupervised trajectories and improve the performance of MaxEnt-IRL.},

It presents the first algorithm that uses optimal storage and provably computes a low-rank approximation of a solution. In particular, when all solutions have low rank, the algorithm converges to a solution. This algorithm, SketchyCGM, modifies a standard convex optimization scheme, the conditional gradient method, to store only a small randomized sketch of the matrix variable. After the optimization terminates, the algorithm extracts a low-rank approximation of the solution from the sketch. In contrast to nonconvex heuristics, the guarantees for SketchyCGM do not rely on statistical models for the problem data. Numerical work demonstrates the benefits of SketchyCGM over heuristics.},

abstract = {Kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) provides a concise set of basis vectors which capture non-linear structures within large data sets, and is a central tool in data analysis and learning. To allow for non-linear relations, typically a full {\$}n \backslashtimes n{\$} kernel matrix is constructed over {\$}n{\$} data points, but this requires too much space and time for large values of {\$}n{\$}. Techniques such as the Nystr$\backslash$"om method and random feature maps can help towards this goal, but they do not explicitly maintain the basis vectors in a stream and take more space than desired. We propose a new approach for streaming KPCA which maintains a small set of basis elements in a stream, requiring space only logarithmic in {\$}n{\$}, and also improves the dependence on the error parameter. Our technique combines together random feature maps with recent advances in matrix sketching, it has guaranteed spectral norm error bounds with respect to the original kernel matrix, and it compares favorably in practice to state-of-the-art approaches.},

abstract = {The statistical leverage scores of a matrix {\$}A{\$} are the squared row-norms of the matrix containing its (top) left singular vectors and the coherence is the largest leverage score. These quantities are of interest in recently-popular problems such as matrix completion and Nystr$\backslash$"{\{}o{\}}m-based low-rank matrix approximation as well as in large-scale statistical data analysis applications more generally; moreover, they are of interest since they define the key structural nonuniformity that must be dealt with in developing fast randomized matrix algorithms. Our main result is a randomized algorithm that takes as input an arbitrary {\$}n \backslashtimes d{\$} matrix {\$}A{\$}, with {\$}n \backslashgg d{\$}, and that returns as output relative-error approximations to all {\$}n{\$} of the statistical leverage scores. The proposed algorithm runs (under assumptions on the precise values of {\$}n{\$} and {\$}d{\$}) in {\$}O(n d \backslashlog n){\$} time, as opposed to the {\$}O(nd{\^{}}2){\$} time required by the na$\backslash$"{\{}i{\}}ve algorithm that involves computing an orthogonal basis for the range of {\$}A{\$}. Our analysis may be viewed in terms of computing a relative-error approximation to an underconstrained least-squares approximation problem, or, relatedly, it may be viewed as an application of Johnson-Lindenstrauss type ideas. Several practically-important extensions of our basic result are also described, including the approximation of so-called cross-leverage scores, the extension of these ideas to matrices with {\$}n \backslashapprox d{\$}, and the extension to streaming environments.},

A recently proposed conditional anomaly detection framework extends anomaly detection to the problem of identifying anomalous patterns on a subset of attributes in the data. The anomaly always depends (is conditioned) on the value of remaining attributes. The work presented in this paper focuses on instance-based methods for detecting conditional anomalies. The methods rely on the distance metric to identify examples in the dataset that are most critical for detecting the anomaly. We investigate various metrics and metric learning methods to optimize the performance of the instance-based anomaly detection methods. We show the benefits of the instance-based methods on two real-world detection problems: detection of unusual admission decisions for patients with the community-acquired pneumonia and detection of unusual orders of an HPF4 test that is used to confirm Heparin induced thrombocytopenia - a life-threatening condition caused by the Heparin therapy.},

The classic way to compute the expected cost of a plan is to use a decision tree with Bayesian networks. A decision tree represents the possible unfolding of events in temporal order. The representation contains two types of nodes called decision nodes and chance nodes. A decision node represents a decision which is an irrevocable allocation of resource. Branches of a decision node correspond to the mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive set of alternatives available to the decision-maker. A chance node represents an uncertain variable. Branches of a chance node correspond to the mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive possible states of the variable. Associated with each chance-node branch, is the decision maker's probability that the variable will be in the corresponding state. Each path through the tree reflects a possible outcome for the decision-maker. Associated with each path is the decision-maker's preference for that outcome.},

Further, we demonstrate a simple, provably efficient approach to structured maximum margin learning, based on the subgradient method, that leverages existing fast algorithms for inference. Although the technique is general, it is particularly relevant in problems where A and dynamic programming approaches make learning policies tractable in problems beyond the limitations of a QP formulation.

We propose a computationally efficient UCB-like algorithm for solving our problem, IMLinUCB, and analyze it on forests. Our regret bounds are polynomial in all quantities of interest; reflect the structure of the network; and do not depend on inherently large quantities, such as the reciprocal of the minimum probability of being influenced and the cardinality of the action set. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first such results. IMLinUCB permits linear generalization and therefore is suitable for large-scale problems. We evaluate IMLinUCB on several synthetic problems and observe that the regret of IMLinUCB scales as suggested by our upper bounds. A special form of our problem can be viewed as a linear bandit and we match the regret bounds of LinUCB in this case.},

This problem has found many applications including online advertisement and online recommendation. We assume the binary feedback is a random variable generated from the logit model, and aim to minimize the regret defined by the unknown linear function. Although the existing method for generalized linear bandit can be applied to our problem, the high computational cost makes it impractical for real-world problems. To address this challenge, we develop an efficient online learning algorithm by exploiting particular structures of the observation model. Specifically, we adopt online Newton step to estimate the unknown parameter and derive a tight confidence region based on the exponential concavity of the logistic loss. Our analysis shows that the proposed algorithm achieves a regret bound of {\$}O(d\backslashsqrt{\{}T{\}}){\$}, which matches the optimal result of stochastic linear bandits.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a prothrombotic
adverse drug reaction caused by heparin. As thrombocytopenia is common
in hospitalized patients receiving heparin, it would be useful to
have a clinical scoring system that could differentiate patients
with HIT from those with other reasons for thrombocytopenia. AIM:
To compare prospectively the diagnostic utility of a clinical score
for HIT in two different clinical settings. METHODS: The pretest
clinical scoring system, the '4 T's', was used to classify 100 consecutive
patients referred for possible HIT in one hospital (Hamilton General
Hospital, HGH) into high, intermediate, and low probability groups.
This system was also used to classify likewise 236 patients by clinicians
in Germany referring blood for diagnostic testing for HIT in Greifswald
(GW). The clinical scores were correlated with the results of laboratory
testing for HIT antibodies using the serologic criteria for HIT with
high diagnostic specificity. RESULTS: In both centers, patients with
low scores were unlikely to test positive for HIT antibodies [HGH:
1/64 (1.6{\%}), GW: 0/55 (0{\%})]. Patients with intermediate [HGH: 8/28
(28.6{\%}), GW: 11/139 (7.9{\%})] or high scores [HGH: 8/8 (100{\%}), GW:
9/42 (21.4{\%})] were more likely to test positive for clinically significant
HIT antibodies. The positive predictive value of an intermediate
or high clinical score for clinically significant HIT antibodies
was higher at one center (HGH). CONCLUSIONS: A low pretest clinical
score for HIT seems to be suitable for ruling out HIT in most situations
(high-negative predictive value). The implications of an intermediate
or high score vary in different clinical settings.},

abstract = {A softmax operator applied to a set of values acts somewhat like the maximization function and somewhat like an average. In sequential decision making, softmax is often used in settings where it is necessary to maximize utility but also to hedge against problems that arise from putting all of one's weight behind a single maximum utility decision. The Boltzmann softmax operator is the most commonly used softmax operator in this setting, but we show that this operator is prone to misbehavior. In this work, we study an alternative softmax operator that, among other properties, is both a non-expansion (ensuring convergent behavior in learning and planning) and differentiable (making it possible to improve decisions via gradient descent methods). We provide proofs of these properties and present empirical comparisons between various softmax operators.},

In this setting, in contrast to most work in bandits, the actions may not be available at all times. For instance, some products might be out of stock in item recommendation. The best existing efficient (i.e., polynomial-time) algorithms for this problem only guarantee a O(T**2/3) upper-bound on the regret. Yet, inefficient algorithms based on EXP4 can achieve O(sqrt(T)). In this paper, we provide a new computationally efficient algorithm inspired by EXP3 satisfying a regret of order O(sqrt(T)) when the availabilities of each action i in A are independent. We then study the most general version of the problem where at each round available sets are generated from some unknown arbitrary distribution (i.e., without the independence assumption) and propose an efficient algorithm with O(sqrt(2**KT)) regret guarantee.

abstract = {We consider stochastic multi-armed bandit problems with complex actions over a set of basic arms, where the decision maker plays a complex action rather than a basic arm in each round. The reward of the complex action is some function of the basic arms' rewards, and the feedback observed may not necessarily be the reward per-arm. For instance, when the complex actions are subsets of the arms, we may only observe the maximum reward over the chosen subset. Thus, feedback across complex actions may be coupled due to the nature of the reward function. We prove a frequentist regret bound for Thompson sampling in a very general setting involving parameter, action and observation spaces and a likelihood function over them. The bound holds for discretely-supported priors over the parameter space and without additional structural properties such as closed-form posteriors, conjugate prior structure or independence across arms. The regret bound scales logarithmically with time but, more importantly, with an improved constant that non-trivially captures the coupling across complex actions due to the structure of the rewards. As applications, we derive improved regret bounds for classes of complex bandit problems involving selecting subsets of arms, including the first nontrivial regret bounds for nonlinear MAX reward feedback from subsets.},

The interpolation of missing values from known samples appears in various applications, such as matrix/vector completion, sampling of high-dimensional data, semi-supervised learning etc. In this paper, we formulate the data interpolation problem as a signal reconstruction problem on a graph, where a graph signal is defined as the information attached to each node (scalar or vector values mapped to the set of vertices/edges of the graph). We use recent results for sampling in graphs to find classes of bandlimited (BL) graph signals that can be reconstructed from their partially observed samples. The interpolated signal is obtained by projecting the input signal into the appropriate BL graph signal space. Additionally, we impose a `bilateral' weighting scheme on the links between known samples, which further improves accuracy. We use our proposed method for collaborative filtering in recommendation systems. Preliminary results show a very favorable trade-off between accuracy and complexity, compared to state of the art algorithms.},

abstract = {Many popular reinforcement learning problems (e.g., navigation in a maze, some Atari games, mountain car) are instances of the episodic setting under its stochastic shortest path (SSP) formulation, where an agent has to achieve a goal state while minimizing the cumulative cost. Despite the popularity of this setting, the exploration-exploitation dilemma has been sparsely studied in general SSP problems, with most of the theoretical literature focusing on different problems (i.e., fixed-horizon and infinite-horizon) or making the restrictive loop-free SSP assumption (i.e., no state can be visited twice during an episode). In this paper, we study the general SSP problem with no assumption on its dynamics (some policies may actually never reach the goal). We introduce UC-SSP, the first no-regret algorithm in this setting, and prove a regret bound scaling as O(DSsqrt(ADK)) after K episodes for any unknown SSP with S states, A actions, positive costs and SSP-diameter D, defined as the smallest expected hitting time from any starting state to the goal. We achieve this result by crafting a novel stopping rule, such that UC-SSP may interrupt the current policy if it is taking too long to achieve the goal and switch to alternative policies that are designed to rapidly terminate the episode.},

@article{koutis2011combinatorial,
abstract = {Several algorithms for problems including image segmentation, gradient inpainting and total variation are based on solving symmetric diagonally dominant (SDD) linear systems. These algorithms generally produce results of high quality. However, existing solvers are not always efficient, and in many cases they operate only on restricted topologies. The unavailability of reliably efficient solvers has arguably hindered the adoptability of approaches and algorithms based on SDD systems, especially in applications involving very large systems. A central claim of this paper is that SDD-based approaches can now be considered practical and reliable. To support our claim we present Combinatorial Multigrid (CMG), the first reliably efficient SDD solver that tackles problems in general and arbitrary weighted topologies. The solver borrows the structure and operators of multigrid algorithms, but embeds into them powerful and algebraically sound combinatorial preconditioners, based on novel tools from support graph theory. In order to present the derivation of CMG, we review and exemplify key notions of support graph theory that can also guide the future development of specialized solvers. We validate our claims on very large systems derived from imaging applications. Finally, we outline two new reductions of non-linear filtering problems to SDD systems and review the integration of SDD systems into selected algorithms. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Recent works (Alaoui 2014, Musco 2016) show that sampling points with replacement according to their ridge leverage scores (RLS) generates small dictionaries of relevant points with strong spectral approximation guarantees for Kn. The drawback of RLS-based methods is that computing exact RLS requires constructing and storing the whole kernel matrix. In this paper, we introduce SQUEAK, a new algorithm for kernel approximation based on RLS sampling that sequentially processes the dataset, storing a dictionary which creates accurate kernel matrix approximations with a number of points that only depends on the effective dimension deffgamma of the dataset. Moreover since all the RLS estimations are efficiently performed using only the small dictionary, SQUEAK never constructs the whole matrix kermatrixn, runs in linear time widetildeO(ndeffgamma3) w.r.t.n, and requires only a single pass over the dataset.},

The agent can only examine vertices whose in-neighbors have already been examined. In scheduling theory, this problem is denoted by 1|prec|∑wjCj [Graham1979]. However, in this paper we address a learning setting where we allow the agent to stop before having found the object and restart searching on a new independent instance of the same problem. The goal is to maximize the total number of hidden objects found under a time constraint. The agent can thus skip an instance after realizing that it would spend too much time on it. Our contributions are both to the search theory and multi-armed bandits. If the distribution is known, we provide a quasi-optimal greedy strategy with the help of known computationally efficient algorithms for solving 1|prec|∑wjCj under some assumption on the DAG. If the distribution is unknown, we show how to sequentially learn it and, at the same time, act near-optimally in order to collect as many hidden objects as possible. We provide an algorithm, prove theoretical guarantees, and empirically show that it outperforms the naive baseline.},

abstract = {In this paper, we consider networks consisting of a finite number of non-overlapping communities. To extract these communities, the interaction between pairs of nodes may be sampled from a large available data set, which allows a given node pair to be sampled several times. When a node pair is sampled, the observed outcome is a binary random variable, equal to 1 if nodes interact and to 0 otherwise. The outcome is more likely to be positive if nodes belong to the same communities. For a given budget of node pair samples or observations, we wish to jointly design a sampling strategy (the sequence of sampled node pairs) and a clustering algorithm that recover the hidden communities with the highest possible accuracy. We consider both non-adaptive and adaptive sampling strategies, and for both classes of strategies, we derive fundamental performance limits satisfied by any sampling and clustering algorithm. In particular, we provide necessary conditions for the existence of algorithms recovering the communities accurately as the network size grows large. We also devise simple algorithms that accurately reconstruct the communities when this is at all possible, hence proving that the proposed necessary conditions for accurate community detection are also sufficient. The classical problem of community detection in the stochastic block model can be seen as a particular instance of the problems consider here. But our framework covers more general scenarios where the sequence of sampled node pairs can be designed in an adaptive manner. The paper provides new results for the stochastic block model, and extends the analysis to the case of adaptive sampling.},

Indeed, you want to exploit the possible structure of the MDP by exploring only a subset of states reachable by following near-optimal policies. You want guarantees on sample complexity that depend on a measure of the quantity of near-optimal states. You want something, that is an extension of Monte-Carlo sampling (for estimating an expectation) to problems that alternate maximization (over actions) and expectation (over next states). But you do not want to StOP with exponential running time, you want something simple to implement and computationally efficient. You want it all and you want it now. You want TrailBlazer.},

abstract = {Often used as importance sampling probabilities, leverage scores have become indispensable in randomized algorithms for linear algebra, optimization, graph theory, and machine learning. A major body of work seeks to adapt these scores to low-rank approximation problems. However, existing "low-rank leverage scores" can be difficult to compute, often work for just a single application, and are sensitive to matrix perturbations. We show how to avoid these issues by exploiting connections between low-rank approximation and regularization. Specifically, we employ ridge leverage scores, which are simply standard leverage scores computed with respect to an {\$}\backslashell{\_}2{\$} regularized input. Importance sampling by these scores gives the first unified solution to two of the most important low-rank sampling problems: {\$}(1+\backslashepsilon){\$} error column subset selection and {\$}(1+\backslashepsilon){\$} error projection-cost preservation. Moreover, ridge leverage scores satisfy a key monotonicity property that does not hold for any prior low-rank leverage scores. Their resulting robustness leads to two sought-after results in randomized linear algebra. 1) We give the first input-sparsity time low-rank approximation algorithm based on iterative column sampling, resolving an open question posed in [LMP13], [CLM+15], and [AM15]. 2) We give the first single-pass streaming column subset selection algorithm whose real-number space complexity has no dependence on stream length.},

Each time an agent takes an action, the corresponding reward is instantaneously observed by the agent, as well as its neighbours in the social network. We perform a regret analysis of various policies in this collaborative learning setting. A key finding of this paper is that natural extensions of widely-studied single agent learning policies to the network setting need not perform well in terms of regret. In particular, we identify a class of non-altruistic and individually consistent policies, and argue by deriving regret lower bounds that they are liable to suffer a large regret in the networked setting. We also show that the learning performance can be substantially improved if the agents exploit the structure of the network, and develop a simple learning algorithm based on dominating sets of the network. Specifically, we first consider a star network, which is a common motif in hierarchical social networks, and show analytically that the hub agent can be used as an information sink to expedite learning and improve the overall regret. We also derive networkwide regret bounds for the algorithm applied to general networks. We conduct numerical experiments on a variety of networks to corroborate our analytical results.},

Suppose that we observe m entries selected uniformly at random from a matrix M. Can we complete the matrix and recover the entries that we have not seen? We show that one can perfectly recover most low-rank matrices from what appears to be an incomplete set of entries. We prove that if the number m of sampled entries obeys m {\textgreater}= C n{\^{}}{\{}1.2{\}} r log n for some positive numerical constant C, then with very high probability, most n by n matrices of rank r can be perfectly recovered by solving a simple convex optimization program. This program finds the matrix with minimum nuclear norm that fits the data. The condition above assumes that the rank is not too large. However, if one replaces the 1.2 exponent with 1.25, then the result holds for all values of the rank. Similar results hold for arbitrary rectangular matrices as well. Our results are connected with the recent literature on compressed sensing, and show that objects other than signals and images can be perfectly reconstructed from very limited information.},

The method can serve as an evaluation function at the leaves of a min-max tree. This paper presents a new framework to combine tree search with Monte-Carlo evaluation, that does not separate between a min-max phase and a Monte-Carlo phase. Instead of backing-up the min-max value close to the root, and the average value at some depth, a more general backup operator is defined that progressively changes from averaging to min-max as the number of simulations grows. This approach provides a fine-grained control of the tree growth, at the level of individual simulations, and allows efficient selectivity. The resulting algorithm was implemented in a 9x9 Go-playing program, Crazy Stone, that won the 10th KGS computer-Go tournament.},

abstract = {One approach to improving the running time of kernel-based machine learning methods is to build a small sketch of the input and use it in lieu of the full kernel matrix in the machine learning task of interest. Here, we describe a version of this approach that comes with running time guarantees as well as improved guarantees on its statistical performance. By extending the notion of $\backslash$emph{\{}statistical leverage scores{\}} to the setting of kernel ridge regression, our main statistical result is to identify an importance sampling distribution that reduces the size of the sketch (i.e., the required number of columns to be sampled) to the $\backslash$emph{\{}effective dimensionality{\}} of the problem. This quantity is often much smaller than previous bounds that depend on the $\backslash$emph{\{}maximal degrees of freedom{\}}. Our main algorithmic result is to present a fast algorithm to compute approximations to these scores. This algorithm runs in time that is linear in the number of samples---more precisely, the running time is {\$}O(np{\^{}}2){\$}, where the parameter {\$}p{\$} depends only on the trace of the kernel matrix and the regularization parameter---and it can be applied to the matrix of feature vectors, without having to form the full kernel matrix. This is obtained via a variant of length-squared sampling that we adapt to the kernel setting in a way that is of independent interest. Lastly, we provide empirical results illustrating our theory, and we discuss how this new notion of the statistical leverage of a data point captures in a fine way the difficulty of the original statistical learning problem.},

In this paper, we study an AL setting in which in addition to the expert's trajectories, a number of unsupervised trajectories is available. We introduce MESSI, a novel algorithm that combines MaxEnt-IRL with principles coming from semi-supervised learning. In particular, MESSI integrates the unsupervised data into the MaxEnt-IRL framework using a pairwise penalty on trajectories. Empirical results in a highway driving and grid-world problems indicate that MESSI is able to take advantage of the unsupervised trajectories and improve the performance of MaxEnt-IRL.},

This feature is found to be a consequence of the two generic mechanisms that networks expand continuously by the addition of new vertices, and new vertices attach preferentially to already well connected sites. A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, indicating that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.},

@inproceedings{mary2015bandits,
abstract = {This paper addresses the on-line recommendation problem facing new users and new items; we assume that no information is available neither about users, nor about the items. The only source of information is a set of ratings given by users to some items. By on-line, we mean that the set of users, and the set of items, and the set of ratings is evolving along time and that at any moment, the recommendation system has to select items to recommend based on the currently available information, that is basically the sequence of past events. We also mean that each user comes with her preferences which may evolve along short and longer scales of time; so we have to continuously update their preferences. When the set of ratings is the only available source of information , the traditional approach is matrix factorization. In a decision making under uncertainty setting, actions should be selected to balance exploration with exploitation; this is best modeled as a bandit problem. Matrix factors provide a latent representation of users and items. These representations may then be used as contextual information by the bandit algorithm to select items. This last point is exactly the originality of this paper: the combination of matrix factorization and bandit algorithms to solve the on-line recommendation problem. Our work is driven by considering the recommendation problem as a feedback controlled loop. This leads to interactions between the representation learning, and the recommendation policy.},

In this work, we study a learning variant of these problems, where the model of the problem is unknown and has to be learned by interacting repeatedly with the environment in the bandit setting. We formalize our learning problem quite generally, as learning how to maximize an unknown modular function on a known polymatroid. We propose a computationally efficient algorithm for solving our problem and bound its expected cumulative regret. Our gap-dependent upper bound is tight up to a constant and our gap-free upper bound is tight up to polylogarithmic factors. Finally, we evaluate our method on three problems and demonstrate that it is practical.},

abstract = {We study bandit best-arm identification with arbitrary and potentially adversarial rewards. A simple random uniform learner obtains the optimal rate of error in the adversarial scenario. However, this type of strategy is suboptimal when the rewards are sampled stochastically. Therefore, we ask: Can we design a learner that performs optimally in both the stochastic and adversarial problems while not being aware of the nature of the rewards? First, we show that designing such a learner is impossible in general. In particular, to be robust to adversarial rewards, we can only guarantee optimal rates of error on a subset of the stochastic problems. We give a lower bound that characterizes the optimal rate in stochastic problems if the strategy is constrained to be robust to adversarial rewards. Finally, we design a simple parameter-free algorithm and show that its probability of error matches (up to log factors) the lower bound in stochastic problems, and it is also robust to adversarial ones.},

In this paper we introduce an abstract setting to clearly describe the essential properties of the problem. While previous work only considered a two-move game tree search problem, our abstract setting can be applied to the general minimax games where the depth can be non-uniform and arbitrary, and transpositions are allowed. We introduce a new algorithm (LUCB-micro) for the abstract setting, and give its lower and upper sample complexity results. Our bounds recover some previous results, which were only available in more limited settings, while they also shed further light on how the structure of minimax problems influence sample complexity.},

Content-based recommendation systems may be used in a variety of domains ranging from recommending web pages, news articles, restaurants, television programs, and items for sale. Although the details of various systems differ, content-based recommendation systems share in common a means for describing the items that may be recommended, a means for creating a profile of the user that describes the types of items the user likes, and a means of comparing items to the user profile to determine what to re commend. The profile is often created and updated automatically in response to feedback on the desirability of items that have been presented to the user.},

We show that for the combination of these two (heterogeneous) datasets, classification models that work well on one of them individually fail on the combination of the two datasets.

@book{wedel200market,
abstract = {Second edition. Modern marketing techniques in industrialized countries cannot be implemented without segmentation of the potential market. Goods are no longer produced and sold without a significant consideration of customer needs combined with a recognition that these needs are heterogeneous. Since first emerging in the late 1950s, the concept of segmentation has been one of the most researched topics in the marketing literature. Segmentation has become a central topic to both the theory and practice of marketing, particularly in the recent development of finite mixture models to better identify market segments. This second edition of Market Segmentation updates and extends the integrated examination of segmentation theory and methodology begun in the first edition. A chapter on mixture model analysis of paired comparison data has been added, together with a new chapter on the pros and cons of the mixture model. The book starts with a framework for considering the various bases and methods available for conducting segmentation studies. The second section contains a more detailed discussion of the methodology for market segmentation, from traditional clustering algorithms to more recent developments in finite mixtures and latent class models. Three types of finite mixture models are discussed in this second section: simple mixtures, mixtures of regressions and mixtures of unfolding models. The third main section is devoted to special topics in market segmentation such as joint segmentation, segmentation using tailored interviewing and segmentation with structural equation models. The fourth part covers four major approaches to applied market segmentation: geo-demographic, lifestyle, response-based, and conjoint analysis. The final concluding section discusses directions for further research. 1 -- Introduction -- 1 The Historical Development of the Market Segmentation Concept -- 2 Segmentation Bases -- 3 Segmentation Methods -- 4 Tools for Market Segmentation -- 2 -- Segmentation Methodology -- 5 Clustering Methods -- 6 Mixture Models -- 7 Mixture Regression Models -- 8 Mixture Unfolding Models -- 9 Profiling Segments -- 10 Dynamic Segmentation -- 3 -- Special Topics in Market Segmentation -- 11 Joint Segmentation -- 12 Market Segmentation with Tailored Interviewing -- 13 Model-Based Segmentation Using Structural Equation Models -- 14 Segmentation Based on Product Dissimilarity Judgements -- 4 -- Applied Market Segmentation -- 15 General Observable Bases: Geo-demographics -- 16 General Unobservable Bases: Values and Lifestyles -- 17 Product-specific observable Bases: Response-based Segmentation -- 18 Product-Specific Unobservable Bases: Conjoint Analysis -- 5 -- Conclusions and Directions for Future Research -- 19 Conclusions: Representations of Heterogeneity -- 20 Directions for Future Research -- References.},

@inproceedings{erraqabi2016rewards,
abstract = {In multi-armed bandits, the most common objective is the maximization of the cumulative reward. Alternative settings include active exploration, where a learner tries to gain accurate estimates of the rewards of all arms. While these objectives are contrasting, in many scenarios it is desirable to trade off rewards and errors. For instance, in educational games the designer wants to gather generalizable knowledge about the behavior of the students and teaching strategies (small estimation errors) but, at the same time, the system needs to avoid giving a bad experience to the players, who may leave the system permanently (large reward). In this paper, we formalize this tradeoff and introduce the ForcingBalance algorithm whose performance is provably close to the best possible tradeoff strategy. Finally, we demonstrate on real-world educational data that ForcingBalance returns useful information about the arms without compromising the overall reward.},

The function is assumed to be locally smooth around one of its global optima, but this smoothness is unknown. Our contribution is an adaptive optimization algorithm, POO or parallel optimistic optimization, that is able to deal with this setting. POO performs almost as well as the best known algorithms requiring the knowledge of the smoothness. Furthermore, POO works for a larger class of functions than what was previously considered, especially for functions that are difficult to optimize, in a very precise sense. We provide a finite-time analysis of POO's performance, which shows that its error after n evaluations is at most a factor of sqrt(ln n) away from the error of the best known optimization algorithms using the knowledge of the smoothness.},

technology and the global superhighways of communication, resulting

prevention technologies are the best way to reduce fraud, fraudsters

such measures. Methodologies for the detection of fraud are essential
if we are to catch fraudsters once fraud prevention has failed. Statistics
and machine learning provide effective technologies for fraud detection
and have been applied successfully to detect activities such as money
laundering, e-commerce credit card fraud, telecommunications fraud
and computer intrusion, to name but a few. We describe the tools
available for statistical fraud detection and the areas in which
fraud detection technologies are most used.},

Generalized MaxEnt aims to find a distribution that maximizes an entropy function while respecting prior information represented as potential functions in miscellaneous forms of constraints and/or penalties. We extend this framework to semi-supervised learning by incorporating unlabeled data via modifications to these potential functions reflecting structural assumptions on the data geometry. The proposed approach leads to a family of discriminative semi-supervised algorithms, that are convex, scalable, inherently multi-class, easy to implement, and that can be kernelized naturally. Experimental evaluation of special cases shows the competitiveness of our methodology.},

abstract = {We consider online learning for minimizing regret in unknown, episodic Markov decision processes (MDPs) with continuous states and actions. We develop variants of the UCRL and posterior sampling algorithms that employ nonparametric Gaussian process priors to generalize across the state and action spaces. When the transition and reward functions of the true MDP are members of the associated Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces of functions induced by symmetric psd kernels (frequentist setting), we show that the algorithms enjoy sublinear regret bounds. The bounds are in terms of explicit structural parameters of the kernels, namely a novel generalization of the information gain metric from kernelized bandit, and highlight the influence of transition and reward function structure on the learning performance. Our results are applicable to multidimensional state and action spaces with composite kernel structures, and generalize results from the literature on kernelized bandits, and the adaptive control of parametric linear dynamical systems with quadratic costs.},

In particular, we consider the case where the expert acts so as to maximize an unknown reward function defined as a linear combination of a set of state features. In this paper, we consider the setting where we observe many sample trajectories (i.e., sequences of states) but only one or a few of them are labeled as experts' trajectories. We investigate the conditions under which the remaining unlabeled trajectories can help in learning a policy with a good performance. In particular, we define an extension to the max-margin inverse reinforcement learning proposed by Abbeel and Ng (2004) where, at each iteration, the max-margin optimization step is replaced by a semi-supervised optimization problem which favors classifiers separating clusters of trajectories. Finally, we report empirical results on two grid-world domains showing that the semi-supervised algorithm is able to output a better policy in fewer iterations than the related algorithm that does not take the unlabeled trajectories into account.},

First, it operates online - at each time step it observes a single new input sample, performs an update and discards it. Second, the solution maintained is extremely sparse. This is achieved by an explicit greedy sparsification process that admits into the kernel representation a new input sample only if its feature space image is linearly independent of the images of previously admitted samples. We show that the algorithm implements a form of gradient ascent and demonstrate its scaling and noise tolerance properties on three benchmark regression problems.},

abstract = {We study the problem of optimizing a function under a budgeted number of evaluations. We only assume that the function is locally smooth around one of its global optima. The difficulty of optimization is measured in terms of 1) the amount of noise b of the function evaluation and 2) the local smoothness, d, of the function. A smaller d results in smaller optimization error. We come with a new, simple, and parameter-free approach. First, for all values of b and d, this approach recovers at least the state-of-the-art regret guarantees. Second, our approach additionally obtains these results while being agnostic to the values of both b and d. This leads to the first algorithm that naturally adapts to an unknown range of noise b and leads to significant improvements in a moderate and low-noise regime. Third, our approach also obtains a remarkable improvement over the state-of-the-art SOO algorithm when the noise is very low which includes the case of optimization under deterministic feedback (b=0). There, under our minimal local smoothness assumption, this improvement is of exponential magnitude and holds for a class of functions that covers the vast majority of functions that practitioners optimize (d=0). We show that our algorithmic improvement is borne out in experiments as we empirically show faster convergence on common benchmarks.},

abstract = {Algorithms based on upper confidence bounds for balancing exploration and exploitation are gaining popularity since they are easy to implement, efficient and effective. This paper considers a variant of the basic algorithm for the stochastic, multi-armed bandit problem that takes into account the empirical variance of the different arms. In earlier experimental works, such algorithms were found to outperform the competing algorithms. We provide the first analysis of the expected regret for such algorithms. As expected, our results show that the algorithm that uses the variance estimates has a major advantage over its alternatives that do not use such estimates provided that the variances of the payoffs of the suboptimal arms are low. We also prove that the regret concentrates only at a polynomial rate. This holds for all the upper confidence bound based algorithms and for all bandit problems except those special ones where with probability one the payoff obtained by pulling the optimal arm is larger than the expected payoff for the second best arm. Hence, although upper confidence bound bandit algorithms achieve logarithmic expected regret rates, they might not be suitable for a risk-averse decision maker. We illustrate some of the results by computer simulations. {\textcopyright}2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Recent advancements in model-based reinforcement learn- ing have shown that the dynamics of many structured do- mains (e.g. DBNs) can be learned with tractable sample com- plexity, despite their exponentially large state spaces. Un- fortunately, these algorithms all require access to a planner that computes a near optimal policy, and while many tra- ditional MDP algorithms make this guarantee, their com- putation time grows with the number of states. We show how to replace these over-matched planners with a class of sample-based plannerswhose computation time is indepen- dent of the number of stateswithout sacrificing the sample- efficiency guarantees of the overall learning algorithms. To do so, we define sufficient criteria for a sample-based planner to be used in such a learning system and analyze two popu- lar sample-based approaches from the literature. We also in- troduce our own sample-based planner, which combines the strategies fromthese algorithms and stillmeets the criteria for integration into our learning system. In doing so, we define the first complete RL solution for compactly represented (ex- ponentially sized) state spaces with efficiently learnable dy- namics that is both sample efficient and whose computation time does not grow rapidly with the number of states.},

The former is associated with a self-concordant logarithmically homogeneous barrier on K, the universal barrier. It is invariant with respect to the unimodular automorphism subgroup of K and is compatible with the operation of taking product cones, but in general it does not behave well under duality. Here we introduce a barrier associated with the Cheng-Yau metric, the canonical barrier. It shares with the universal barrier the invariance, existence, and uniqueness properties and is compatible with the operation of taking product cones, but in addition is well behaved under duality. The canonical barrier can be characterized as the convex solution of the partial differential equation log det F? = 2F that tends to infinity as the argument tends to the boundary of K. Its barrier parameter does not exceed the dimension n of the cone. On homogeneous cones both barriers essentially coincide.},

Recent works (Alaoui 2014, Musco 2016) show that sampling points with replacement according to their ridge leverage scores (RLS) generates small dictionaries of relevant points with strong spectral approximation guarantees for Kn. The drawback of RLS-based methods is that computing exact RLS requires constructing and storing the whole kernel matrix. In this paper, we introduce SQUEAK, a new algorithm for kernel approximation based on RLS sampling that sequentially processes the dataset, storing a dictionary which creates accurate kernel matrix approximations with a number of points that only depends on the effective dimension deffgamma of the dataset. Moreover since all the RLS estimations are efficiently performed using only the small dictionary, SQUEAK never constructs the whole matrix kermatrixn, runs in linear time widetildeO(ndeffgamma3) w.r.t.n, and requires only a single pass over the dataset. We also propose a parallel and distributed version of SQUEAK achieving similar accuracy in as little as widetildeO(log(n)deffgamma3) time.},

Under a stochastic semi-bandit feedback, we propose and analyze IMLinUCB, a computationally efficient UCB-based algorithm. Our bounds on the cumulative regret are polynomial in all quantities of interest, achieve near-optimal dependence on the number of interactions and reflect the topology of the network and the activation probabilities of its edges, thereby giving insights on the problem complexity. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first such results. Our experiments show that in several representative graph topologies, the regret of IMLinUCB scales as suggested by our upper bounds. IMLinUCB permits linear generalization and thus is both statistically and computationally suitable for large-scale problems. Our experiments also show that IMLinUCB with linear generalization can lead to low regret in real-world online influence maximization.},

abstract = {This chapter about the recognition, treatment, and prevention of heparin-induced
thrombocytopenia (HIT) is part of the Seventh ACCP Conference on
Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: Evidence Based Guidelines.
Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits
do, or do not, outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests
that individual patients' values may lead to different choices (for
a full understanding of the grading, see Guyatt et al, CHEST 2004;
126:179S-187S). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are
the following: For patients in whom the risk of HIT is considered
to be {\textgreater} 0.1{\%}, we recommend platelet count monitoring (Grade 1C).
For patients who are receiving therapeutic-dose unfractionated heparin
(UFH), we suggest at least every-other-day platelet count monitoring
until day 14, or until UFH is stopped, whichever occurs first (Grade
2C). For patients who are receiving postoperative antithrombotic
prophylaxis with UFH (HIT risk {\textgreater} 1{\%}), we suggest at least every-other-day
platelet count monitoring between postoperative days 4 to 14 (or
until UFH is stopped, whichever occurs first) [Grade 2C]. For medical/obstetric
patients who are receiving prophylactic-dose UFH, postoperative patients
receiving prophylactic-dose low molecular weight heparin (LMWH),
postoperative patients receiving intravascular catheter UFH "flushes,"
or medical/obstetrical patients receiving LMWH after first receiving
UFH (risk, 0.1 to 1{\%}), we suggest platelet count monitoring every
2 days or 3 days from day 4 to day 14, or until heparin is stopped,
whichever occurs first (Grade 2C). For medical/obstetrical patients
who are only receiving LMWH, or medical patients who are receiving
only intravascular catheter UFH flushes (risk {\textless} 0.1{\%}), we suggest
clinicians do not use routine platelet count monitoring (Grade 2C).
For patients with strongly suspected (or confirmed) HIT, whether
or not complicated by thrombosis, we recommend use of an alternative
anticoagulant, such as lepirudin (Grade 1C+), argatroban (Grade 1C),
bivalirudin (Grade 2C), or danaparoid (Grade 1B). For patients with
strongly suspected (or confirmed) HIT, we recommend routine ultrasonography
of the lower-limb veins for investigation of deep venous thrombosis
(Grade 1C); against the use of vitamin K antagonist (VKA) [coumarin]
therapy until after the platelet count has substantially recovered;
that the VKA antagonist be administered only during overlapping alternative
anticoagulation (minimum 5-day overlap); and begun with low, maintenance
doses (all Grade 2C). For patients receiving VKAs at the time of
diagnosis of HIT, we recommend use of vitamin K (Grade 2C) [corrected]
For patients with a history of HIT who are HIT antibody negative
and require cardiac surgery, we recommend use of UFH (Grade 1C).},

abstract = {Large-scale kernel ridge regression (KRR) is limited by the need to store a large kernel matrix Kt. To avoid storing the entire matrix Kt, Nyström methods subsample a subset of columns of the kernel matrix, and efficiently find an approximate KRR solution on the reconstructed Kt . The chosen subsampling distribution in turn affects the statistical and computational tradeoffs. For KRR problems, [15, 1] show that a sampling distribution proportional to the ridge leverage scores (RLSs) provides strong reconstruction guarantees for Kt. While exact RLSs are as difficult to compute as a KRR solution, we may be able to approximate them well enough. In this paper, we study KRR problems in a sequential setting and introduce the INK-ESTIMATE algorithm, that incrementally computes the RLSs estimates. INK-ESTIMATE maintains a small sketch of Kt, that at each step is used to compute an intermediate es- timate of the RLSs. First, our sketch update does not require access to previously seen columns, and therefore a single pass over the kernel ma- trix is sufficient. Second, the algorithm requires a fixed, small space budget to run dependent only on the effective dimension of the kernel matrix. Finally, our sketch provides strong approximation guarantees on the distance ∥Kt−Kt∥2 , and on the statistical risk of the approximate KRR solution at any time, because all our guarantees hold at any intermediate step.},

abstract = {Despite their successes, what makes kernel methods difficult to use in many large scale problems is the fact that computing the de- cision function is typically expensive, espe- cially at prediction time. In this paper, we overcome this difficulty by proposing Fast- food, an approximation that accelerates such computation significantly. Key to Fastfood is the observation that Hadamard matri- ces when combined with diagonal Gaussian matrices exhibit properties similar to dense Gaussian random matrices. Yet unlike the latter, Hadamard and diagonal matrices are inexpensive to multiply and store. These two matrices can be used in lieu of Gaussian matrices in Random Kitchen Sinks (Rahimi {\&} Recht, 2007) and thereby speeding up the computation for a large range of ker- nel functions. Specifically, Fastfood requires O(n log d) time and O(n) storage to compute n non-linear basis functions in d dimensions, a significant improvement from O(nd) com- putation and storage, without sacrificing ac- curacy. We prove that the approximation is unbiased and has low variance. Extensive ex- periments show that we achieve similar accu- racy to full kernel expansions and Random Kitchen Sinks while being 100x faster and us- ing 1000x less memory. These improvements, especially in terms of memory usage, make kernel methods more practical for applica- tions that have large training sets and/or re- quire real-time prediction.},

@article{fill1998interruptible,
abstract = {For a large class of examples arising in statistical physics known as attractive spin systems (e.g., the Ising model), one seeks to sample from a probability distribution $\pi$ on an enormously large state space, but elementary sampling is ruled out by the infeasibility of calculating an appropriate normalizing constant. The same difficulty arises in computer science problems where one seeks to sample randomly from a large finite distributive lattice whose precise size cannot be ascertained in any reasonable amount of time. The Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approximate sampling approach to such a problem is to construct and run "for a long time" a Markov chain with long-run distribution $\pi$. But determining how long is long enough to get a good approximation can be both analytically and empirically difficult. Recently, Propp and Wilson have devised an ingenious and efficient algorithm to use the same Markov chains to produce perfect (i.e., exact) samples from $\pi$. However, the running time of their algorithm is an unbounded random variable whose order of magnitude is typically unknown a priori and which is not independent of the state sampled, so a naive user with limited patience who aborts a long run of the algorithm will introduce bias. We present a new algorithm which (1) again uses the same Markov chains to produce perfect samples from $\pi$, but is based on a different idea (namely, acceptance/rejection sampling); and (2) eliminates user-impatience bias. Like the Propp-Wilson algorithm, the new algorithm applies to a general class of suitably monotone chains, and also (with modification) to "anti-monotone" chains. When the chain is reversible, naive implementation of the algorithm uses fewer transitions but more space than Propp-Wilson. When fine-tuned and applied with the aid of a typical pseudorandom number generator to an attractive spin system on n sites using a random site updating Gibbs sampler whose mixing time $\tau$ is polynomial in n, the algorithm runs in time of the same order (bound) as Propp-Wilson [expectation O($\tau$ log n)] and uses only logarithmically more space [expectation O(n log n), vs. O(n) for Propp-Wilson].},

abstract = {Gaussian Process bandit optimization has emerged as a powerful tool for optimizing noisy black box functions. One example in machine learning is hyper-parameter optimization where each evaluation of the target function requires training a model which may involve days or even weeks of computation. Most methods for this so-called "Bayesian optimization" only allow sequential exploration of the parameter space. However, it is often desirable to propose batches or sets of parameter values to explore simultaneously, especially when there are large parallel processing facilities at our disposal. Batch methods require modeling the interaction between the different evaluations in the batch, which can be expensive in complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose a new approach for parallelizing Bayesian optimization by modeling the diversity of a batch via Determinantal point processes (DPPs) whose kernels are learned automatically. This allows us to generalize a previous result as well as prove better regret bounds based on DPP sampling. Our experiments on a variety of synthetic and real-world robotics and hyper-parameter optimization tasks indicate that our DPP-based methods, especially those based on DPP sampling, outperform state-of-the-art methods.},

Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. Butmany biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks ‘rewired' to intro- duce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them ‘small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon13,14 (popularly known as six degrees of separation15 ). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},

In applications as recommendation systems, online advertising, and crowdsourcing, the changes may be triggered by the pulls, so that the arms' rewards change as a function of the number of pulls. In this paper, we consider the specific case of non-parametric rotting bandits, where the expected reward of an arm may decrease every time it is pulled. We introduce the filtering on expanding window average (FEWA) algorithm that at each round constructs moving averages of increasing windows to identify arms that are more likely to return high rewards when pulled once more. We prove that, without any knowledge on the decreasing behavior of the arms, FEWA achieves similar anytime problem-dependent, O(log(KT)), and problem-independent, O(sqrtKT), regret bounds of near-optimal stochastic algorithms as UCB1 of Auer et al. (2002a). This result substantially improves the prior result of Levine et al. (2017) which needed knowledge of the horizon and decaying parameters to achieve problem-independent bound of only O(K1/3T2/3). Finally, we report simulations confirming the theoretical improvements of FEWA.},

The method is adaptive: as sampling proceeds, the rejection envelope and the squeezing function converge to the density function. The rejection envelope and squeezing function are piece-wise exponential functions, the rejection envelope touching the density at previously sampled points, and the squeezing function forming arcs between those points of contact. The technique is intended for situations where evaluation of the density is computationally expensive, in particular for applications of Gibbs sampling to Bayesian models with non-conjugacy.

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to provide a univariate and multivariate analysis of genomic microbial data and salivary mass-spectrometry proteomic profiles for dental caries outcomes. In order to determine potential useful biomarkers for dental caries, a multivariate classification analysis was employed to build predictive models capable of classifying microbial and salivary sample profiles with generalization performance. We used high-throughput methodologies including multiplexed microbial arrays and SELDI-TOF-MS profiling to characterize the oral flora and salivary proteome in 204 children aged 1-8 years (n = 118 caries-free, n = 86 caries-active). The population received little dental care and was deemed at high risk for childhood caries. Findings of the study indicate that models incorporating both microbial and proteomic data are superior to models of only microbial or salivary data alone. Comparison of results for the combined and independent data suggests that the combination of proteomic and microbial sources is beneficial for the classification accuracy and that combined data lead to improved predictive models for caries-active and caries-free patients. The best predictive model had a 6{\%} test error, {\textgreater}92{\%} sensitivity, and {\textgreater}95{\%} specificity. These findings suggest that further characterization of the oral microflora and the salivary proteome associated with health and caries may provide clinically useful biomarkers to better predict future caries experience.},

the key problems of computing marginals and modes of probability

exponential family representations, and exploiting the conjugate
duality between the cumulant generating function and the entropy
for exponential families, we develop general variational representations
of the problems of computing marginal probabilities and modes. We
describe how a wide variety of known computational algorithms�including
mean field methods and cluster variational techniques�can be understood
in terms of approximations of these variational representations.
We also present novel convex relaxations based on the variational
framework. The variational approach provides a complementary alternative
to Markov chain Monte Carlo as a general source of approximation
methods for inference in large-scale statistical models.},

Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) provides an efficient tool for generaliz- ing the demonstration, based on the assump- tion that the expert is optimally acting in a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Most of the past work on IRL requires that a (near)- optimal policy can be computed for differ- ent reward functions. However, this require- ment can hardly be satisfied in systems with a large, or continuous, state space. In this pa- per, we propose a model-free IRL algorithm, where the relative entropy between the em- pirical distribution of the state-action trajec- tories under a uniform policy and their distri- bution under the learned policy is minimized by stochastic gradient descent. We compare this new approach to well-known IRL algo- rithms using approximate MDP models. Em- pirical results on simulated car racing, grid- world and ball-in-a-cup problems show that our approach is able to learn good policies from a small number of demonstrations.},

In this paper, we examine the bandit problem under the weaker assumption that the distributions have moments of order 1 + $\epsilon$, for some $\epsilon$ ∈ (0,1]. Surprisingly, moments of order 2 (i.e., finite variance) are sufficient to obtain regret bounds of the same order as under sub-Gaussian reward distributions. In order to achieve such regret, we define sampling strategies based on refined estimators of the mean such as the truncated empirical mean, Catoni's M-estimator, and the median-of-means estimator. We also derive matching lower bounds that also show that the best achievable regret deteriorates when $\epsilon$ {\textless}; 1. View full abstract},

@inproceedings{calandriello2019gaussian,
abstract = {Gaussian processes (GP) are a stochastic processes, used as Bayesian approach for the optimization of black-box functions. Despite their effectiveness in simple problems, GP-based algorithms hardly scale to high-dimensional functions, as their per-iteration time and space cost is at least quadratic in the number of dimensions d and iterations t. Given a set of A alternatives to choose from, the overall runtime O(t 3 A) is prohibitive. In this paper, we introduce BKB (budgeted kernelized bandit), a new approximate GP algorithm for optimization under bandit feedback that achieves near-optimal regret (and hence near-optimal convergence rate) with near-constant per-iteration complexity and remarkably no assumption on the input space or covariance of the GP. We combine a kernelized linear bandit algorithm (GP-UCB) leverage score sampling as a randomized matrix sketching and prove that selecting inducing points based on their posterior variance gives an accurate low-rank approximation of the GP, preserving variance estimates and confidence intervals. As a consequence, BKB does not suffer from variance starvation, an important problem faced by many previous sparse GP approximations. Moreover, we show that our procedure selects at most O(d eff) points, where d eff is the effective dimension of the explored space, which is typically much smaller than both d and t. This greatly reduces the dimensionality of the problem, thus leading to a O(T Ad 2 eff) runtime and O(Ad eff) space complexity.},

These are employed to devise adaptive sequential sampling procedures that guarantee recovery of the true matrix in Frobenius norm after a data-driven stopping time {\$}\backslashhat n{\$} for the number of measurements that have to be taken. With high probability, this stopping time is minimax optimal. We detail applications to quantum tomography problems where measurements arise from Pauli observables. We also give a theoretical construction of a confidence set for the density matrix of a quantum state that has optimal diameter in nuclear norm.

abstract = {We present the first single pass algorithm for computing spectral sparsifiers of graphs in the dynamic semi-streaming model. Given a single pass over a stream containing insertions and deletions of edges to a graph G, our algorithm maintains a randomized linear sketch of the incidence matrix of G into dimension O((1/epsilon{\{}$\backslash$textasciicircum{\}}2) n polylog(n)). Using this sketch, at any point, the algorithm can output a (1 +/- epsilon) spectral sparsifier for G with high probability. While O((1/epsilon{\{}$\backslash$textasciicircum{\}}2) n polylog(n)) space algorithms are known for computing "cut sparsifiers" in dynamic streams [AGM12b, GKP12] and spectral sparsifiers in "insertion-only" streams [KL11], prior to our work, the best known single pass algorithm for maintaining spectral sparsifiers in dynamic streams required sketches of dimension Omega((1/epsilon{\{}$\backslash$textasciicircum{\}}2) n{\{}$\backslash$textasciicircum{\}}(5/3)) [AGM14]. To achieve our result, we show that, using a coarse sparsifier of G and a linear sketch of G's incidence matrix, it is possible to sample edges by effective resistance, obtaining a spectral sparsifier of arbitrary precision. Sampling from the sketch requires a novel application of ell{\_}2/ell{\_}2 sparse recovery, a natural extension of the ell{\_}0 methods used for cut sparsifiers in [AGM12b]. Recent work of [MP12] on row sampling for matrix approximation gives a recursive approach for obtaining the required coarse sparsifiers. Under certain restrictions, our approach also extends to the problem of maintaining a spectral approximation for a general matrix A{\{}$\backslash$textasciicircum{\}}T A given a stream of updates to rows in A.},

abstract = {Thompson Sampling (TS) has surged a lot of interest due to its good empirical performance, in particular in the computational advertising. Though successful, the tools for its performance analysis appeared only recently. In this paper, we describe and analyze SpectralTS algorithm for a bandit problem, where the payoffs of the choices are smooth given an underlying graph. In this setting, each choice is a node of a graph and the expected payoffs of the neighboring nodes are assumed to be similar. Although the setting has application both in recommender systems and advertising, the traditional algorithms would scale poorly with the number of choices. For that purpose we consider an effective dimension d, which is small in real-world graphs. We deliver the analysis showing that the regret of SpectralTS scales as d$\backslash$sqrt(T $\backslash$ln N) with high probability, where T is the time horizon and N is the number of choices. Since a d$\backslash$sqrt(T $\backslash$ln N) regret is comparable to the known results, SpectralTS offers a computationally more efficient alternative. We also show that our algorithm is competitive on both synthetic and real-world data.},

Elements have weights {\{}w{\_}e{\}} and the goal is to maximize the weight of a chosen subset S of active elements. However, we are given only the p{\_}e values-- to determine whether or not an element e is active, our algorithm must probe e. If element e is probed and happens to be active, then e must irrevocably be added to the chosen set S; if e is not active then it is not included in S. Moreover, the following conditions must hold in every random instantiation: (1) the set Q of probed elements satisfy an "outer" packing constraint, and (2) the set S of chosen elements satisfy an "inner" packing constraint. The kinds of packing constraints we consider are intersections of matroids and knapsacks. Our results provide a simple and unified view of results in stochastic matching and Bayesian mechanism design, and can also handle more general constraints. As an application, we obtain the first polynomial-time {\$}\backslashbackslashOmega(1/k){\$}-approximate "Sequential Posted Price Mechanism" under k-matroid intersection feasibility constraints.},

abstract = {Kernel-based algorithms such as support vector machines have achieved considerable success in various problems in batch setting, where all of the training data is available in advance. Support vector machines combine the so-called kernel trick with the large margin idea. There has been little use of these methods in an online setting suitable for real-time applications. In this paper, we consider online learning in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. By considering classical stochastic gradient descent within a feature space and the use of some straightforward tricks, we develop simple and computationally efficient algorithms for a wide range of problems such as classification, regression, and novelty detection. In addition to allowing the exploitation of the kernel trick in an online setting, we examine the value of large margins for classification in the online setting with a drifting target. We derive worst-case loss bounds, and moreover, we show the convergence of the hypothesis to the minimizer of the regularized risk functional. We present some experimental results that support the theory as well as illustrating the power of the new algorithms for online novelty detection.},

abstract = {Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) were introduced by Mac-chi [1] as a model for repulsive (fermionic) particle distributions. But their recent popularization is largely due to their usefulness for encouraging diversity in the final stage of a recommender system [2]. The standard sampling scheme for finite DPPs is a spectral decomposition followed by an equivalent of a randomly diagonally-pivoted Cholesky factorization of an orthogonal projection, which is only applicable to Hermitian kernels and has an expensive setup cost. Researchers have begun to connect DPP sampling to LDL H factoriza-tions as a means of avoiding the initial spectral decomposition, but existing approaches have only outperformed the spectral decomposition approach in special circumstances, where the number of kept modes is a small percentage of the ground set size. This article proves that trivial modifications of LU and LDL H fac-torizations yield efficient direct sampling schemes for non-Hermitian and Hermitian DPP kernels, respectively. Further, it is experimentally shown that even dynamically-scheduled, shared-memory paralleliza-tions of high-performance dense and sparse-direct factorizations can be trivially modified to yield DPP sampling schemes with essentially identical performance. The software developed as part of this research, Catamari [hodges-tar.com/catamari] is released under the Mozilla Public License v2.0. It contains header-only, C++14 plus OpenMP 4.0 implementations of dense and sparse-direct, Hermitian and non-Hermitian DPP samplers. * jack@hodgestar.com, Hodge Star Scientific Computing},

abstract = {We consider the problem of imitation learning where the examples, demonstrated by an expert, cover only a small part of a large state space. Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) provides an efficient tool for generalizing the demonstration, based on the assumption that the expert is optimally acting in a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Past work on IRL requires that an accurate model of the underlying MDP is known. However, this requirement can hardly be satisfied in practice, as learning a model of a dynamical system with a large, or continuous, state space is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a model-free IRL algorithm, where the relative entropy between the empirical distribution of the trajectories under a uniform policy and their distribution under the learned policy is minimized by stochastic gradient descent. We compare this new approach to well-known IRL algorithms using approximate MDP models. Empirical results on simulated car racing, gridworld and ball-in-a-cup problems show that our approach is able to learn good policies from a small number of demonstrations.},

abstract = {Bayesian optimization (BO) has become an effective approach for black-box function optimization problems when function evaluations are expensive and the optimum can be achieved within a relatively small number of queries. However, many cases, such as the ones with high-dimensional inputs, may require a much larger number of observations for optimization. Despite an abundance of observations thanks to parallel experiments, current BO techniques have been limited to merely a few thousand observations. In this paper, we propose ensemble Bayesian optimization (EBO) to address three current challenges in BO simultaneously: (1) large-scale observations; (2) high dimensional input spaces; and (3) selections of batch queries that balance quality and diversity. The key idea of EBO is to operate on an ensemble of additive Gaussian process models, each of which possesses a randomized strategy to divide and conquer. We show unprecedented, previously impossible results of scaling up BO to tens of thousands of observations within minutes of computation.},

We are particularly interested in the high-dimensional setting where the number {\$}mT{\$} of unknown entries can be much larger than the sample size {\$}N{\$}. Motivated by several applications, we consider estimation of matrix {\$}A{\$} under the assumption that it has small rank. This can be viewed as dimension reduction or sparsity assumption. In order to shrink toward a low-rank representation, we investigate penalized least squares estimators with a Schatten-{\$}p{\$} quasi-norm penalty term, {\$}p\backslashleq1{\$}. We study these estimators under two possible assumptions---a modified version of the restricted isometry condition and a uniform bound on the ratio "empirical norm induced by the sampling operator/Frobenius norm." The main results are stated as nonasymptotic upper bounds on the prediction risk and on the Schatten-{\$}q{\$} risk of the estimators, where {\$}q\backslashin[p,2]{\$}. The rates that we obtain for the prediction risk are of the form {\$}rm/N{\$} (for {\$}m=T{\$}), up to logarithmic factors, where {\$}r{\$} is the rank of {\$}A{\$}. The particular examples of multi-task learning and matrix completion are worked out in detail. The proofs are based on tools from the theory of empirical processes.

Zinkevich shows that, if the each function is revealed after the choice is made, then one can achieve vanishingly small regret relative the best single decision chosen in hindsight. We extend this to the bandit setting where we do not find out the entire functions but rather just their value at our chosen point. We show how to get vanishingly small regret in this setting. Our approach uses a simple approximation of the gradient that is computed from evaluating a function at a single (random) point. We show that this estimate is sufficient to mimic Zinkevich's gradient descent online analysis, with access to the gradient (only being able to evaluate the function at a single point).},

abstract = {We consider supervised learning problems within the positive-definite kernel framework, such as kernel ridge regression, kernel logistic regression or the support vector machine. With kernels leading to infinite-dimensional feature spaces, a common practical limiting difficulty is the necessity of computing the kernel matrix, which most frequently leads to algorithms with running time at least quadratic in the number of observations n, i.e., O(n{\^{}}2). Low-rank approximations of the kernel matrix are often considered as they allow the reduction of running time complexities to O(p{\^{}}2 n), where p is the rank of the approximation. The practicality of such methods thus depends on the required rank p. In this paper, we show that in the context of kernel ridge regression, for approximations based on a random subset of columns of the original kernel matrix, the rank p may be chosen to be linear in the degrees of freedom associated with the problem, a quantity which is classically used in the statistical analysis of such methods, and is often seen as the implicit number of parameters of non-parametric estimators. This result enables simple algorithms that have sub-quadratic running time complexity, but provably exhibit the same predictive performance than existing algorithms, for any given problem instance, and not only for worst-case situations.},

@article{samukhin2008laplacian,
abstract = {We study the Laplacian operator of an uncorrelated random network and, as an application, consider hopping processes (diffusion, random walks, signal propagation, etc.) on networks. We develop a strict approach to these problems. We derive an exact closed set of integral equations, which provide the averages of the Laplacian operator's resolvent. This enables us to describe the propagation of a signal and random walks on the network. We show that the determining parameter in this problem is the minimum degree {\$}q{\_}m{\$} of vertices in the network and that the high-degree part of the degree distribution is not that essential. The position of the lower edge of the Laplacian spectrum {\$}\backslashlambda{\_}c{\$} appears to be the same as in the regular Bethe lattice with the coordination number {\$}q{\_}m{\$}. Namely, {\$}\backslashlambda{\_}c{\textgreater}0{\$} if {\$}q{\_}m{\textgreater}2{\$}, and {\$}\backslashlambda{\_}c=0{\$} if {\$}q{\_}m\backslashleq2{\$}. In both these cases the density of eigenvalues {\$}\backslashrho(\backslashlambda)\backslashto0{\$} as {\$}\backslashlambda\backslashto\backslashlambda{\_}c+0{\$}, but the limiting behaviors near {\$}\backslashlambda{\_}c{\$} are very different. In terms of a distance from a starting vertex, the hopping propagator is a steady moving Gaussian, broadening with time. This picture qualitatively coincides with that for a regular Bethe lattice. Our analytical results include the spectral density {\$}\backslashrho(\backslashlambda){\$} near {\$}\backslashlambda{\_}c{\$} and the long-time asymptotics of the autocorrelator and the propagator.},

We achieve adaptiveness to the norms of the loss vectors by scale invariance, i.e., our algorithms make exactly the same decisions if the sequence of loss vectors is multiplied by any positive constant. The algorithm based on FTRL works for any decision set, bounded or unbounded. For unbounded decisions sets, this is the first adaptive algorithm for online linear optimization with a non-vacuous regret bound.

While classical SGD relies on uniformly sampling data points to form a mini-batch, we propose a non-uniform sampling scheme based on the Determinantal Point Process (DPP). The DPP relies on a similarity measure between data points and gives low probabilities to mini-batches which contain redundant data, and higher probabilities to mini-batches with more diverse data. This simultaneously balances the data and leads to stochastic gradients with lower variance. We term this approach Diversified Mini-Batch SGD (DM-SGD). We show that regular SGD and a biased version of stratified sampling emerge as special cases. Furthermore, DM-SGD generalizes stratified sampling to cases where no discrete features exist to bin the data into groups. We show experimentally that our method results more interpretable and diverse features in unsupervised setups, and in better classification accuracies in supervised setups.},

At each iteration, the algorithm proposes new values for the control variables and generates the function from the conditional GP prior. The control variable input locations are found by continuously minimizing an objective function. We demonstrate the algorithm on regression and classification problems and we use it to estimate the parameters of a differential equation model of gene regulation.},

Nonetheless, the exact versions of these methods scale poorly with the number of nodes n of the graph. In this paper, we combine a spectral sparsification routine with Laplacian learning. Given a graph G as input, our algorithm computes a sparsifier in a distributed way in O(nlog3(n)) time, O(mlog3(n)) work and O(nlog(n)) memory, using only log(n) rounds of communication. Furthermore, motivated by the regularization often employed in learning algorithms, we show that constructing sparsifiers that preserve the spectrum of the Laplacian only up to the regularization level may drastically reduce the size of the final graph. By constructing a spectrally-similar graph, we are able to bound the error induced by the sparsification for a variety of downstream tasks (e.g., SSL). We empirically validate the theoretical guarantees on Amazon co-purchase graph and compare to the state-of-the-art heuristics.},

abstract = {In bandits, arms' distributions are stationary. This is often violated in practice, where rewards change over time. In applications as recommendation systems, online advertising, and crowdsourcing, the changes may be triggered by the pulls, so that the arms' rewards change as a function of the number of pulls. In this paper, we consider the specific case of non-parametric rotting bandits, where the expected reward of an arm may decrease every time it is pulled. We introduce the filtering on expanding window average (FEWA) algorithm that at each round constructs moving averages of increasing windows to identify arms that are more likely to return high rewards when pulled once more.

abstract = {We develop graph-based methods for semi-supervised learning based on label propagation on a data similarity graph. When data is abundant or arrive in a stream, the problems of computation and data storage arise for any graph-based method. We propose a fast approximate online algorithm that solves for the harmonic solution on an approximate graph. We show, both empirically and theoretically, that good behavior can be achieved by collapsing nearby points into a set of local representative points that minimize distortion. Moreover, we regularize the harmonic solution to achieve better stability properties. We also present graph-based methods for detecting conditional anomalies and apply them to the identification of unusual clinical actions in hospitals. Our hypothesis is that patient-management actions that are unusual with respect to the past patients may be due to errors and that it is worthwhile to raise an alert if such a condition is encountered. Conditional anomaly detection extends standard unconditional anomaly framework but also faces new problems known as fringe and isolated points. We devise novel nonparametric graph-based methods to tackle these problems. Our methods rely on graph connectivity analysis and soft harmonic solution. Finally, we conduct an extensive human evaluation study of our conditional anomaly methods by 15 experts in critical care.},

abstract = {Models for the processes by which ideas and influence propagate through a social network have been studied in a number of domains, including the diffusion of medical and technological innovations, the sudden and widespread adoption of various strategies in game-theoretic settings, and the effects of “word of mouth” in the promotion of new products. Recently, motivated by the design of viral marketing strategies, Domingos and Richardson posed a fundamental algorithmic problem for such social network processes: if we can try to convince a subset of individuals to adopt a new product or innovation, and the goal is to trigger a large cascade of further adoptions, which set of individuals should we target? We consider this problem in several of the most widely studied models in social network analysis. The optimization problem of selecting the most influential nodes is NP-hard here, and we provide the first provable approximation guarantees for efficient algorithms. Using an analysis framework based on submodular functions, we show that a natural greedy strategy obtains a solution that is provably within 63{\%} of optimal for several classes of models; our framework suggests a general approach for reasoning about the performance guarantees of algorithms for these types of influence problems in social networks. We also provide computational experiments on large collaboration networks, showing that in addition to their provable guarantees, our approximation algorithms significantly out-perform nodeselection heuristics based on the well-studied notions of degree centrality and distance centrality from the field of social networks.},

abstract = {Social networks are commonly used for marketing purposes. For example, free samples of a product can be given to a few influential social network users (or "seed nodes"), with the hope that they will convince their friends to buy it. One way to formalize marketers' objective is through influence maximization (or IM), whose goal is to find the best seed nodes to activate under a fixed budget, so that the number of people who get influenced in the end is maximized. Recent solutions to IM rely on the influence probability that a user influences another one. However, this probability information may be unavailable or incomplete. In this paper, we study IM in the absence of complete information on influence probability. We call this problem Online Influence Maximization (OIM) since we learn influence probabilities at the same time we run influence campaigns. To solve OIM, we propose a multiple-trial approach, where (1) some seed nodes are selected based on existing influence information; (2) an influence campaign is started with these seed nodes; and (3) users' feedback is used to update influence information. We adopt the Explore-Exploit strategy, which can select seed nodes using either the current influence probability estimation (exploit), or the confidence bound on the estimation (explore). Any existing IM algorithm can be used in this framework. We also develop an incremental algorithm that can significantly reduce the overhead of handling users' feedback information. Our experiments show that our solution is more effective than traditional IM methods on the partial information.},

abstract = {This work studies two interrelated problems - online robust PCA (RPCA) and online low-rank matrix completion (MC). In recent work by Cand$\backslash$`{\{}e{\}}s et al., RPCA has been defined as a problem of separating a low-rank matrix (true data), {\$}L:=[\backslashell{\_}1, \backslashell{\_}2, \backslashdots \backslashell{\_}{\{}t{\}}, \backslashdots , \backslashell{\_}{\{}t{\_}{\{}\backslashmax{\}}{\}}]{\$} and a sparse matrix (outliers), {\$}S:=[x{\_}1, x{\_}2, \backslashdots x{\_}{\{}t{\}}, \backslashdots, x{\_}{\{}t{\_}{\{}\backslashmax{\}}{\}}]{\$} from their sum, {\$}M:=L+S{\$}. Our work uses this definition of RPCA. An important application where both these problems occur is in video analytics in trying to separate sparse foregrounds (e.g., moving objects) and slowly changing backgrounds. While there has been a large amount of recent work on both developing and analyzing batch RPCA and batch MC algorithms, the online problem is largely open. In this work, we develop a practical modification of our recently proposed algorithm to solve both the online RPCA and online MC problems. The main contribution of this work is that we obtain correctness results for the proposed algorithms under mild assumptions. The assumptions that we need are: (a) a good estimate of the initial subspace is available (easy to obtain using a short sequence of background-only frames in video surveillance); (b) the {\$}\backslashell{\_}t{\$}'s obey a `slow subspace change' assumption; (c) the basis vectors for the subspace from which {\$}\backslashell{\_}t{\$} is generated are dense (non-sparse); (d) the support of {\$}x{\_}t{\$} changes by at least a certain amount at least every so often; and (e) algorithm parameters are appropriately set},

abstract = {Finding a small spectral approximation for a tall {\$}n \backslashtimes d{\$} matrix {\$}A{\$} is a fundamental numerical primitive. For a number of reasons, one often seeks an approximation whose rows are sampled from those of {\$}A{\$}. Row sampling improves interpretability, saves space when {\$}A{\$} is sparse, and preserves row structure, which is especially important, for example, when {\$}A{\$} represents a graph. However, correctly sampling rows from {\$}A{\$} can be costly when the matrix is large and cannot be stored and processed in memory. Hence, a number of recent publications focus on row sampling in the streaming setting, using little more space than what is required to store the outputted approximation [KL13, KLM+14]. Inspired by a growing body of work on online algorithms for machine learning and data analysis, we extend this work to a more restrictive online setting: we read rows of {\$}A{\$} one by one and immediately decide whether each row should be kept in the spectral approximation or discarded, without ever retracting these decisions. We present an extremely simple algorithm that approximates {\$}A{\$} up to multiplicative error {\$}\backslashepsilon{\$} and additive error {\$}\backslashdelta{\$} using {\$}O(d \backslashlog d \backslashlog(\backslashepsilon||A||{\_}2/\backslashdelta)/\backslashepsilon{\^{}}2){\$} online samples, with memory overhead proportional to the cost of storing the spectral approximation. We also present an algorithm that uses {\$}O(d{\^{}}2{\$}) memory but only requires {\$}O(d\backslashlog(\backslashepsilon||A||{\_}2/\backslashdelta)/\backslashepsilon{\^{}}2){\$} samples, which we show is optimal. Our methods are clean and intuitive, allow for lower memory usage than prior work, and expose new theoretical properties of leverage score based matrix approximation.},

abstract = {We consider online learning problems under a partial observability model capturing situations where the information conveyed to the learner is between full information and bandit feedback. In the simplest variant, we assume that in addition to its own loss, the learner also gets to observe losses of some other actions. The revealed losses depend on the learner's action and a directed observation system chosen by the environment. For this setting, we propose the first algorithm that enjoys near-optimal regret guarantees without having to know the observation system before selecting its actions. Along similar lines, we also define a new partial information setting that models online combinatorial optimization problems where the feedback received by the learner is between semi-bandit and full feedback. As the predictions of our first algorithm cannot be always computed efficiently in this setting, we propose another algorithm with similar properties and with the benefit of always being computationally efficient, at the price of a slightly more complicated tuning mechanism. Both algorithms rely on a novel exploration strategy called implicit exploration, which is shown to be more efficient both computationally and information-theoretically than previously studied exploration strategies for the problem.},

In a series of recent papers, it was established that this scheduling problem is a special case of minimum weighted vertex cover. In this paper, we show that the vertex cover graph associated with the scheduling problem is exactly the graph of incomparable pairs defined in the dimension theory of partial orders. Exploiting this relationship allows us to present a framework for obtaining (2 — 2/f)-approximation algorithms, provided that the set of precedence constraints has fractional dimension of at most f. Our approach yields the best-known approximation ratios for all previously considered special classes of precedence constraints, and it provides the first results for bounded degree and orders of interval dimension 2. On the negative side, we show that the addressed problem remains NP-hard even when restricted to the special case of interval orders. Furthermore, we prove that the general problem, if a fixed cost present in all feasible schedules is ignored, becomes as hard to approximate as vertex cover. We conclude by giving the first inapproximability result for this problem, showing under a widely believed assumption that it does not admit a polynomial-time approximation scheme.},

Some open problems remain before we can try out the complete agent; more arise when we consider scaling up. A second theme of the talk will be whether reinforcement learning can provide a good model of animal and human learning. To answer this question, we must do inverse reinforcement learning: given the observed behaviour, what reward signal, if any, is being optimized?

Following Dumitriu and Edelman (2002), we see the ensemble as the eigenvalues of a random tridiagonal matrix, namely a random Jacobi matrix. First, we provide a unifying and elementary treatment of the tridiagonal models associated to the three classical Hermite, Laguerre and Jacobi ensembles. For this purpose, we use simple changes of variables between successive reparametrizations of the coefficients defining the tridiagonal matrix. Second, we derive an approximate sampler for the simulation of $\beta$-ensembles, and illustrate how fast it can be for polynomial potentials. This method combines a Gibbs sampler on Jacobi matrices and the diagonalization of these matrices. In practice, even for large ensembles, only a few Gibbs passes suffice for the marginal distribution of the eigenvalues to fit the expected theoretical distribution. When the conditionals in the Gibbs sampler can be simulated exactly, the same fast empirical convergence is observed for the fluctuations of the largest eigenvalue. Our experimental results support a conjecture by Krishnapur et al. (2016), that the Gibbs chain on Jacobi matrices of size N mixes in O(log(N)).},

This is the balance between staying with the option that gave highest payoffs in the past and exploring new options that might give higher payoffs in the future. Although the study of bandit problems dates back to the Thirties, exploration-exploitation trade-offs arise in several modern applications, such as ad placement, website optimization, and packet routing. Mathematically, a multi-armed bandit is defined by the payoff process associated with each option. In this survey, we focus on two extreme cases in which the analysis of regret is particularly simple and elegant: i.i.d. payoffs and adversarial payoffs.

The raw Enron corpus contains 619,446 messages belonging to 158 users. We cleaned the corpus before this analysis by removing certain folders from each user, such as discussionthreads. These folders were present for most users, and did not appear to be used directly by the users, but rather were computer generated. Many, such as alldocuments, also contained large numbers of duplicate emails, which were already present in the users other folders. Our goal in this paper is to analyze the suitability of this corpus for exploring how to classify messages as organized by a human, so these folders would have likely been misleading.},

abstract = {Sequential prediction problems such as imitation learning, where future observations depend on previous predictions (actions), violate the common i.i.d. assumptions made in statistical learning. This leads to poor performance in theory and often in practice. Some recent approaches provide stronger guarantees in this setting, but remain somewhat unsatisfactory as they train either non-stationary or stochastic policies and require a large number of iterations. In this paper, we propose a new iterative algorithm, which trains a stationary deterministic policy, that can be seen as a no regret algorithm in an online learning setting. We show that any such no regret algorithm, combined with additional reduction assumptions, must find a policy with good performance under the distribution of observations it induces in such sequential settings. We demonstrate that this new approach outperforms previous approaches on two challenging imitation learning problems and a benchmark sequence labeling problem.},

Our simple two-step methodology is general enough to cover the case of an arbitrary (possibly continuously infinite) family of distributions as well as [0,1]-valued random variables not necessarily summing up to 1. Several novel applications are provided, in which the consideration of random variables is particularly handy. The most important applications deal with the problem of Bayesian posterior concentration (minimax or distribution-dependent) rates and with a lower bound on the regret in non-stochastic sequential learning. We also improve in passing some earlier fundamental results: in particular, we provide a simple and enlightening proof of the refined Pinsker's inequality of Ordentlich and Weinberger and derive a sharper Bretagnolle-Huber inequality.},

It is shown that in such a setting the area represents the probability
that a randomly chosen diseased subject is (correctly) rated or ranked
with greater suspicion than a randomly chosen non-diseased subject.
Moreover, this probability of a correct ranking is the same quantity
that is estimated by the already well-studied nonparametric Wilcoxon
statistic. These two relationships are exploited to (a) provide rapid
closed-form expressions for the approximate magnitude of the sampling
variability, i.e., standard error that one uses to accompany the
area under a smoothed ROC curve, (b) guide in determining the size
of the sample required to provide a sufficiently reliable estimate
of this area, and (c) determine how large sample sizes should be
to ensure that one can statistically detect differences in the accuracy

abstract = {We study the multi-armed bandit problems with budget constraint and variable costs (MAB-BV). In this setting, pulling an arm will receive a random reward together with a random cost, and the objective of an algorithm is to pull a sequence of arms in order to maximize the expected total reward with the costs of pulling those arms complying with a budget constraint. This new setting models many Internet applications (e.g., ad exchange, sponsored search, and cloud computing) in a more accurate manner than previous settings where the pulling of arms is either costless or with a fixed cost.We propose two UCB based algorithms for the new setting. The first algorithm needs prior knowledge about the lower bound of the expected costs when computing the exploration term. The second algorithm eliminates this need by estimating the minimal expected costs from empirical observations, and therefore can be applied to more real-world applications where pri- or knowledge is not available.We prove that both algorithms have nice learning abilities, with regret bounds of O(lnB). Furthermore, we show that when applying our proposed algorithms to a previous setting with fixed costs (which can be regarded as our special case), one can improve the previously obtained regret bound. Our simulation results on real-time bidding in ad exchange verify the effectiveness of the algorithms and are consistent with our theoretical analysis},

This formulation applies to matrix games as well as sequential games. Our new algorithmic scheme computes an $\epsilon$-equilibrium to this min-max problem in O({\P}A{\P} /$\delta$(A) ln(1/$\epsilon$)) first-order iterations, where $\delta$(A) is a certain condition measure of the matrix A. This improves upon the previous first-order methods which required O(1/$\epsilon$)iterations, and it matches the iteration complexity bound of interior-point methods in terms of the algorithm's dependence on $\epsilon$. Unlike interior-point methods that are inapplicable to large games due to their memory requirements, our algorithm retains the small memory requirements of prior first-order methods. Our scheme supplements Nesterov's method with an outer loop that lowers the target $\epsilon$between iterations (this target affects the amount of smoothing in the inner loop). Computational experiments both in matrix games and sequential games show that a significant speed improvement is obtained in practice as well, and the relative speed improvement increases with the desired accuracy (as suggested by the complexity bounds). {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer and Mathematical Optimization Society.},

Spectral sparsifiers generalize cut sparsifiers, and have found many applications in designing graph algorithms. In recent years, there has been interest in computing spectral sparsifiers in semi-streaming and dynamic settings. Natural algorithms in these settings often involve repeated sparsification of a graph, and accumulation of errors across these steps. We present a framework for analyzing algorithms that perform repeated sparsifications that only incur error corresponding to a single sparsification step, leading to better results for many resparsification-based algorithms. As an application, we show how to maintain a spectral sparsifier in the semi-streaming setting: We present a simple algorithm that, for a graph {\$}G{\$} on {\$}n{\$} vertices and {\$}m{\$} edges, computes a spectral sparsifier of {\$}G{\$} with {\$}O(n \backslashlog n){\$} edges in a single pass over {\$}G{\$}, using only {\$}O(n \backslashlog n){\$} space, and {\$}O(m \backslashlog{\^{}}2 n){\$} total time. This improves on previous best semi-streaming algorithms for both spectral and cut sparsifiers by a factor of {\$}\backslashlog{\{}n{\}}{\$} in both space and runtime. The algorithm extends to semi-streaming row sampling for general PSD matrices. We also use our framework to combine a spectral sparsification algorithm by Koutis with improved spanner constructions to give a parallel algorithm for constructing {\$}O(n\backslashlog{\^{}}2{\{}n{\}}\backslashlog\backslashlog{\{}n{\}}){\$} sized spectral sparsifiers in {\$}O(m\backslashlog{\^{}}2{\{}n{\}}\backslashlog\backslashlog{\{}n{\}}){\$} time. This is the best known combinatorial graph sparsification algorithm.The size of the sparsifiers is only a factor {\$}\backslashlog{\{}n{\}}\backslashlog\backslashlog{\{}n{\}}{\$} more than ones produced by numerical routines.},

Each state of the MDP is characterized by a random value and the learner should gather samples to estimate the mean value of each state as accurately as possible. Similarly to active exploration in multi-armed bandit (MAB), states may have different levels of noise, so that the higher the noise, the more samples are needed. As the noise level is initially unknown, we need to trade off the exploration of the environment to estimate the noise and the exploitation of these estimates to compute a policy maximizing the accuracy of the mean predictions. We introduce a novel learning algorithm to solve this problem showing that active exploration in MDPs may be significantly more difficult than in MAB. We also derive a heuristic procedure to mitigate the negative effect of slowly mixing policies. Finally, we validate our findings on simple numerical simulations.},

abstract = { We consider a population of n projects which in general continue to evolve whether in operation or not (although by different rules). It is desired to choose the projects in operation at each instant of time so as to maximise the expected rate of reward, under a constraint upon the expected number of projects in operation. The Lagrange multiplier associated with this constraint defines an index which reduces to the Gittins index when projects not being operated are static. If one is constrained to operate m projects exactly then arguments are advanced to support the conjecture that, for m and n large in constant ratio, the policy of operating the m projects of largest current index is nearly optimal. The index is evaluated for some particular projects. },

@article{isaac2009overrides,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Electronic prescribing systems with decision support may
improve patient safety in ambulatory care by offering drug allergy
and drug interaction alerts. However, preliminary studies show that
clinicians override most of these alerts. METHODS: We performed a
retrospective analysis of 233 537 medication safety alerts generated
by 2872 clinicians in Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania
who used a common electronic prescribing system from January 1, 2006,
through September 30, 2006. We used multivariate techniques to examine
factors associated with alert acceptance. RESULTS: A total of 6.6{\%}
of electronic prescription attempts generated alerts. Clinicians
accepted 9.2{\%} of drug interaction alerts and 23.0{\%} of allergy alerts.
High-severity interactions accounted for most alerts (61.6{\%}); clinicians
accepted high-severity alerts slightly more often than moderate-
or low-severity interaction alerts (10.4{\%}, 7.3{\%}, and 7.1{\%}, respectively;
P {\textless} .001). Clinicians accepted 2.2{\%} to 43.1{\%} of high-severity interaction
alerts, depending on the classes of interacting medications. In multivariable
analyses, we found no difference in alert acceptance among clinicians
of different specialties (P = .16). Clinicians were less likely to
accept a drug interaction alert if the patient had previously received
the alerted medication (odds ratio, 0.03; 95{\%} confidence interval,
0.03-0.03). CONCLUSION: Clinicians override most medication alerts,
suggesting that current medication safety alerts may be inadequate
to protect patient safety.},

This approach reduces the problem of learning to recovering a utility function that makes the behavior induced by a near-optimal policy closely mimic demonstrated behavior. In this work, we develop a probabilistic approach based on the principle of maximum entropy. Our approach provides a well-defined, globally normalized distribution over decisions, while providing the same performance guarantees as existing methods.We develop our technique in the context of modeling real-world navigation and driving behaviors where collected data is inherently noisy and imperfect. Our probabilistic approach enables modeling of route preferences as well as a powerful new approach to inferring destinations and routes based on partial trajectories.},

Then, in case of matroid constraints, we design adapted approximation routines, thereby providing the first efficient algorithms that exploit the reward structure. In particular, we improve the state-of-the-art efficient gap-free regret bound by a factor sqrt(k), where k is the maximum action size.

Such a setting is interesting in many applications involving monitoring and surveillance, where the set of the actions to observe represent some (geographical) area. The importance of this setting is that in these applications, it is actually cheaper to observe average reward of a group of actions rather than the reward of a single action. We show that when the reward is smooth over a given graph representing the neighboring actions, we can maximize the cumulative reward of learning while minimizing the sensing cost. In this paper we propose CheapUCB, an algorithm that matches the regret guarantees of the known algorithms for this setting and at the same time guarantees a linear cost again over them. As a by-product of our analysis, we establish a Omega($\backslash$sqrt(dT)) lower bound on the cumulative regret of spectral bandits for a class of graphs with effective dimension d.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of finding the best arm in a stochastic multi-armed bandit game. The regret of a forecaster is here defined by the gap between the mean reward of the optimal arm and the mean reward of the ultimately chosen arm. We propose a highly exploring UCB policy and a new algorithm based on successive rejects. We show that these algorithms are essentially optimal since their regret decreases exponentially at a rate which is, up to a logarithmic factor, the best possible. However, while the UCB policy needs the tuning of a parameter depending on the unobservable hardness of the task, the successive rejects policy benefits from being parameter-free, and also independent of the scaling of the rewards.},

abstract = {This paper considers the Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) problem, that is inferring a reward function for which a demonstrated expert policy is optimal. We propose to break the IRL problem down into two generic Supervised Learning steps: this is the Cascaded Supervised IRL (CSI) approach. A classification step that defines a score function is followed by a regression step providing a reward function. A theoretical analysis shows that the demonstrated expert policy is nearoptimal for the computed reward function. Not needing to repeatedly solve a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and the ability to leverage existing techniques for classification and regression are two important advantages of the CSI approach. It is furthermore empirically demonstrated to compare positively to state-of-the-art approaches when using only transitions sampled according to the expert policy, up to the use of some heuristics. This is exemplified on two classical benchmarks (the mountain car problem and a highway driving simulator).},

@inproceedings{liu2011dynamic,
abstract = {We consider a large-scale cyber network with N components (e.g., paths, servers, subnets). Each component is either in a healthy state (0) or an abnormal state (1). Due to random intrusions, the state of each component transits from 0 to 1 over time according to certain stochastic process. At each time, a subset of K (K {\textless} N) components are checked and those observed in abnormal states are fixed. The objective is to design the optimal scheduling for intrusion detection such that the long-term network cost incurred by all abnormal components is minimized. We formulate the problem as a special class of Restless Multi-Armed Bandit (RMAB) process. A general RMAB suffers from the curse of dimensionality (PSPACE-hard) and numerical methods are often inapplicable. We show that, for this class of RMAB, Whittle index exists and can be obtained in closed form, leading to a low-complexity implementation of Whittle index policy with a strong performance. For homogeneous components, Whittle index policy is shown to have a simple structure that does not require any prior knowledge on the intrusion processes. Based on this structure, Whittle index policy is further shown to be optimal over a finite time horizon with an arbitrary length. Beyond intrusion detection, these results also find applications in queuing networks with finite-size buffers.},

abstract = {Thompson Sampling is one of the oldest heuristics for multi-armed bandit problems. It is a randomized algorithm based on Bayesian ideas, and has recently generated significant interest after several studies demonstrated it to have better empirical performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods. However, many questions regarding its theoretical performance remained open. In this paper, we design and analyze a generalization of Thompson Sampling algorithm for the stochastic contextual multi-armed bandit problem with linear payoff functions, when the contexts are provided by an adaptive adversary. This is among the most important and widely studied versions of the contextual bandits problem. We provide the first theoretical guarantees for the contextual version of Thompson Sampling. We prove a high probability regret bound of {\$}\backslashtilde{\{}O{\}}(d{\^{}}{\{}3/2{\}}\backslashsqrt{\{}T{\}}){\$} (or {\$}\backslashtilde{\{}O{\}}(d\backslashsqrt{\{}T \backslashlog(N){\}}){\$}), which is the best regret bound achieved by any computationally efficient algorithm available for this problem in the current literature, and is within a factor of {\$}\backslashsqrt{\{}d{\}}{\$} (or {\$}\backslashsqrt{\{}\backslashlog(N){\}}{\$}) of the information-theoretic lower bound for this problem.},

We first identify sufficient conditions for the consistency of generic sequential algorithms and formulate the expected minimax rate for their performance. We introduce and analyze a first algorithm called LIPO which assumes the Lipschitz constant to be known. Consistency, minimax rates for LIPO are proved, as well as fast rates under an additional H$\backslash$"older like condition. An adaptive version of LIPO is also introduced for the more realistic setup where the Lipschitz constant is unknown and has to be estimated along with the optimization. Similar theoretical guarantees are shown to hold for the adaptive LIPO algorithm and a numerical assessment is provided at the end of the paper to illustrate the potential of this strategy with respect to state-of-the-art methods over typical benchmark problems for global optimization.},

@techreport{jin2020reward-free,
abstract = {Exploration is widely regarded as one of the most challenging aspects of reinforcement learning (RL), with many naive approaches succumbing to exponential sample complexity. To isolate the challenges of exploration, we propose a new "reward-free RL" framework. In the exploration phase, the agent first collects trajectories from an MDP {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}M{\}}{\$} without a pre-specified reward function. After exploration, it is tasked with computing near-optimal policies under for {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}M{\}}{\$} for a collection of given reward functions. This framework is particularly suitable when there are many reward functions of interest, or when the reward function is shaped by an external agent to elicit desired behavior. We give an efficient algorithm that conducts {\$}\backslashtilde{\{}\backslashmathcal{\{}O{\}}{\}}(S{\^{}}2A\backslashmathrm{\{}poly{\}}(H)/\backslashepsilon{\^{}}2){\$} episodes of exploration and returns {\$}\backslashepsilon{\$}-suboptimal policies for an arbitrary number of reward functions. We achieve this by finding exploratory policies that visit each "significant" state with probability proportional to its maximum visitation probability under any possible policy. Moreover, our planning procedure can be instantiated by any black-box approximate planner, such as value iteration or natural policy gradient. We also give a nearly-matching {\$}\backslashOmega(S{\^{}}2AH{\^{}}2/\backslashepsilon{\^{}}2){\$} lower bound, demonstrating the near-optimality of our algorithm in this setting.},

Known as a determinantal point process, this distribution is used in machine learning to induce diversity in subset selection. In practice, we often wish to sample multiple subsets S with small expected size k = E[card(S)] that is much smaller then n from a very large matrix L, so it is important to minimize the preprocessing cost of the procedure (performed once) as well as the sampling cost (performed repeatedly). For this purpose, we propose a new algorithm which, given access to L, samples exactly from a determinantal point process while satisfying the following two properties: (1) its preprocessing cost is n x poly(k) (sublinear in the size of L) and (2) its sampling cost is poly(k) (independent of the size of L). Prior to our results, state-of-the-art exact samplers required O(n3) preprocessing time and sampling time linear in n or dependent on the spectral properties of L. We also give a reduction which allows using our algorithm for sampling from cardinality constrained determinantal point processes with n x poly(k) time preprocessing.},

The scaling of our regret bound with the number of states (contexts) N goes as sqrtN Irhot(S;A), where Irhot(S;A) is the mutual information between states and actions (the side information) used by the algorithm at round t. If the algorithm uses all the side information, the regret bound scales as sqrtN ln K, where K is the number of actions (arms). However, if the side information Irhot(S;A) is not fully used, the regret bound is significantly tighter. In the extreme case, when Irhot(S;A) = 0, the dependence on the number of states reduces from linear to logarithmic. Our analysis allows to provide the algorithm large amount of side information, let the algorithm to decide which side information is relevant for the task, and penalize the algorithm only for the side information that it is using de facto.

The algorithm is based on online mirror descent with Tsallis entropy regularizer. We provide a complete characterization of such algorithms and show that Tsallis entropy with power {\$}\alpha= 1/2{\$} achieves the goal. In addition, the proposed algorithm enjoys improved regret guarantees in two intermediate regimes: the moderately contaminated stochastic regime defined by Seldin and Slivkins [22] and the stochastically constrained adversary studied by Wei and Luo [26]. The algorithm also obtains adversarial and stochastic optimality in the utility-based dueling bandit setting. We provide empirical evaluation of the algorithm demonstrating that it outperforms Ucb1 and Exp3 in stochastic environments. In certain adversarial regimes the algorithm significantly outperforms Ucb1 and Thompson Sampling, which exhibit close to linear regret.},

A critical problem in information retrieval is online learning to rank, where a search engine strives to improve the quality of the ranked result lists it presents to users on the basis of those users' interactions with those result lists. Recently, researchers have started to model interactions between users and search engines as contextual bandit problems, and initial methods for learning in this setting have been devised. Our research focuses on two aspects: balancing exploration and exploitation and inferring preferences from implicit user interactions.

However, tight near-optimality guarantees are not yet available for the general case of stochastic Markov decision processes and closed-loop, state-dependent planning policies. We there-fore consider an algorithm related to AO* that optimistically explores a tree represen-tation of the space of closed-loop policies, and we analyze the near-optimality of the action it returns after n tree node expan-sions. While this optimistic planning requires a finite number of actions and possible next states for each transition, its asymptotic per-formance does not depend directly on these numbers, but only on the subset of nodes that significantly impact near-optimal poli-cies. We characterize this set by introduc-ing a novel measure of problem complexity, called the near-optimality exponent. Special-izing the exponent and performance bound for some interesting classes of MDPs illus-trates the algorithm works better when there are fewer near-optimal policies and less uni-form transition probabilities.},

However, many cases, such as the ones with high-dimensional inputs, may require a much larger number of observations for optimization. Despite an abundance of observations thanks to parallel experiments, current BO techniques have been limited to merely a few thousand observations. In this paper, we propose ensemble Bayesian optimization (EBO) to address three current challenges in BO simultaneously: (1) large-scale observations; (2) high dimensional input spaces; and (3) selections of batch queries that balance quality and diversity. The key idea of EBO is to operate on an ensemble of additive Gaussian process models, each of which possesses a randomized strategy to divide and conquer. We show unprecedented, previously impossible results of scaling up BO to tens of thousands of observations within minutes of computation.},

However, in practice, actions can consist of picking subsets of readings from sensors that may break from time to time, road segments that can be blocked or goods that are out of stock. In this paper we study learning algorithms that are able to deal with stochastic availability of such unreliable composite actions. We propose and analyze algorithms based on the Follow-The-Perturbed-Leader prediction method for several learning settings differing in the feedback provided to the learner. Our algorithms rely on a novel loss estimation technique that we call Counting Asleep Times. We deliver regret bounds for our algorithms for the previously studied full information and (semi-)bandit settings, as well as a natural middle point between the two that we call the restricted information setting. A special consequence of our results is a significant improvement of the best known performance guarantees achieved by an efficient algorithm for the sleeping bandit problem with stochastic availability. Finally, we evaluate our algorithms empirically and show their improvement over the known approaches.},

In particular, we establish theoretical foundations of optimal campaigning over social networks where the user activities are modeled as a multivariate Hawkes process, and we derive a time dependent linear relation between the intensity of exogenous events and several commonly used objective functions of campaigning. We further develop a convex dynamic programming framework for determining the optimal intervention policy that prescribes the required level of external drive at each stage for the desired campaigning result. Experiments on both synthetic data and the real-world MemeTracker dataset show that our algorithm can steer the user activities for optimal campaigning much more accurately than baselines.},

Typical distributions considered depend on specific parameter values, whose prior knowledge is required in theory but quite difficult to estimate in practice; an example is the commonly assumed sub-Gaussian family. We alleviate this issue by instead considering a new general family of sub-exponential distributions, which contains bounded and Gaussian ones. We prove a new lower bound on the expected regret on this family, that is parameterized by the unknown covariance matrix of rewards, a tighter quantity than the sub-Gaussian matrix. We then construct an algorithm that uses covariance estimates, and provide a tight asymptotic analysis of the regret. Finally, we apply and extend our results to the family of sparse rewards, which has applications in many recommender systems.},

Active learning involves sequential sampling procedures that use information gleaned from previous samples in order to focus the sampling and accelerate the learning process relative to "passive learning" algorithms, which are based on nonadaptive (usually random) samples. There are a number of empirical and theoretical results suggesting that in certain situations active learning can be significantly more effective than passive learning. However, the fact that active learning algorithms are feedback systems makes their theoretical analysis very challenging. This paper aims to shed light on achievable limits in active learning. Using minimax analysis techniques, we study the achievable rates of classification error convergence for broad classes of distributions characterized by decision boundary regularity and noise conditions. The results clearly indicate the conditions under which one can expect significant gains through active learning. Furthermore, we show that the learning rates derived are tight for "boundary fragment" classes in d-dimensional feature spaces when the feature marginal density is bounded from above and below.},

abstract = {Social networks have been popular platforms for information propagation. An important use case is viral marketing: given a promotion budget, an advertiser can choose some influential users as the seed set and provide them free or discounted sample products; in this way, the advertiser hopes to increase the popularity of the product in the users' friend circles by the world-of-mouth effect, and thus maximizes the number of users that information of the production can reach. There has been a body of literature studying the influence maximization problem. Nevertheless, the existing studies mostly investigate the problem on a one-off basis, assuming fixed known influence probabilities among users, or the knowledge of the exact social network topology. In practice, the social network topology and the influence probabilities are typically unknown to the advertiser, which can be varying over time, i.e., in cases of newly established, strengthened or weakened social ties. In this paper, we focus on a dynamic non-stationary social network and design a randomized algorithm, RSB, based on multi-armed bandit optimization, to maximize influence propagation over time. The algorithm produces a sequence of online decisions and calibrates its explore-exploit strategy utilizing outcomes of previous decisions. It is rigorously proven to achieve an upper-bounded regret in reward and applicable to large-scale social networks. Practical effectiveness of the algorithm is evaluated using both synthetic and real-world datasets, which demonstrates that our algorithm outperforms previous stationary methods under non-stationary conditions.},

abstract = {Kernel online convex optimization (KOCO) is a framework combining the expressiveness of non-parametric kernel models with the regret guarantees of online learning. First-order KOCO methods such as functional gradient descent require only O(t) time and space per iteration, and, when the only information on the losses is their convexity, achieve a minimax optimal O(sqrtT) regret. Nonetheless, many common losses in kernel problems, such as squared loss, logistic loss, and squared hinge loss posses stronger curvature that can be exploited. In this case, second-order KOCO methods achieve O(log(Det(K))) regret, which we show scales as O(deff log T), where deff is the effective dimension of the problem and is usually much smaller than O(sqrtT). The main drawback of second-order methods is their much higher O(t 2) space and time complexity. In this paper, we introduce kernel online Newton step (KONS), a new second-order KOCO method that also achieves O(defflog T) regret. To address the computational complexity of second-order methods, we introduce a new matrix sketching algorithm for the kernel matrix K, and show that for a chosen parameter gamma leq 1 our Sketched-KONS reduces the space and time complexity by a factor of gamma 2 to O(t 2gamma 2) space and time per iteration, while incurring only 1/gamma times more regret.},

abstract = {I introduce a family of prior distributions over multivariate distributions, based on the use of a " Dirichlet diffusion tree " to generate exchangeable data sets. These priors can be viewed as generalizations of Dirichlet processes and of Dirichlet process mixtures, but unlike simple mixtures, they can capture the hierarchical structure present in many distributions, by means of the latent diffusion tree underlying the data. This latent tree also provides a hierarchical clustering of the data, which, unlike ad hoc clustering methods, comes with probabilistic indications of uncertainty. The relevance of each variable to the clustering can also be determined. Although Dirichlet diffusion trees are defined in terms of a continuous-time process, posterior inference involves only finite-dimensional quantities, allowing computation to be performed by reasonably efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. The methods are demonstrated on problems of modeling a two-dimensional density and of clustering gene expression data. 1. INTRODUCTION Unknown distributions are encountered when estimating the density of observed data and when modeling the distribution of random effects or other latent variables. Exploratory data analysis can also be viewed in terms of finding features of the data, such as clusters, that are useful in modeling its distribution. A Bayesian model involving an unknown distribution requires a prior distribution over distributions. For such a model to be useful in practice, the prior must be an adequate approximation to our actual prior beliefs about the unknown distribution, and it must be possible to compute the predictive distribution for new data with reasonable efficiency. The Dirichlet process (Ferguson 1973) is a simple and computationally tractable prior for an unknown distribution. However, it produces distributions that are discrete with probability one, making it unsuitable for density modeling. This can be avoided by convolving the distribution with some continuous kernel, or more generally, by using a Dirichlet process to define a mixture distribution with infinitely many components, of some simple parametric form (Antoniak 1973; Ferguson 1983). Such Dirichlet process mixture models are not always ideal, however, because they use a prior distribution in which the parameters of one mixture component are independent of the parameters of other components. For many problems, we would expect instead that the components will be hierarchically organized, in ways analogous to the hierarchical grouping of organisms belonging to various species. Even if no obvious hierarchy is present, modeling a complex distribution by a mixture of simple distributions will require that each mode of the distribution be modeled using many of these simple mixture components, which will have similar parameters, and therefore form clusters themselves. Since Dirichlet process mixture models don't capture this hierarchical structure, inference using these models will be inefficient},

We use this general connection to derive variance and tail bounds for order statistics of Gaussian sample. Those bounds are not within the scope of the Tsirelson-Ibragimov-Sudakov Gaussian concentration inequality.

abstract = {In a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem a gambler needs to choose at each round of play one of K arms, each characterized by an unknown reward distribution. Reward realizations are only observed when an arm is selected, and the gambler's objective is to maximize his cumulative expected earnings over some given horizon of play T. To do this, the gambler needs to acquire information about arms (exploration) while simultaneously optimizing immediate rewards (exploitation); the price paid due to this trade off is often referred to as the regret, and the main question is how small can this price be as a function of the horizon length T. This problem has been studied extensively when the reward distributions do not change over time; an assumption that supports a sharp characterization of the regret, yet is often violated in practical settings. In this paper, we focus on a MAB formulation which allows for a broad range of temporal uncertainties in the rewards, while still maintaining mathematical tractability. We fully characterize the (regret) complexity of this class of MAB problems by establishing a direct link between the extent of allowable reward "variation" and the minimal achievable regret. Our analysis draws some connections between two rather disparate strands of literature: the adversarial and the stochastic MAB frameworks.},

A recently proposed conditional anomaly detection framework extends anomaly detection to the problem of identifying anomalous patterns on a subset of attributes in the data.

The methods depend heavily on the distance metric that lets us identify examples in the dataset that are most critical for detecting the anomaly. To optimize the performance of the anomaly detection methods we explore and study metric learning methods. We evaluate the quality of our methods on the Pneumonia PORT dataset by detecting unusual admission decisions for patients with the community-acquired pneumonia. The results of our metric learning methods show an improved detection performance over standard distance metrics, which is very promising for building automated anomaly detection systems for variety of intelligent monitoring applications.},

abstract = {Policy gradient methods are reinforcement learning algorithms that adapt a parameterized policy by following a performance gradient estimate. Many conventional policy gradient methods use Monte-Carlo techniques to estimate this gradient. The policy is improved by adjusting the parameters in the direction of the gradient estimate. Since Monte-Carlo methods tend to have high variance, a large number of samples is required to attain accurate estimates, resulting in slow convergence. In this paper, we first propose a Bayesian framework for policy gradient, based on modeling the policy gradient as a Gaussian process. This reduces the number of samples needed to obtain accurate gradient estimates. Moreover, estimates of the natural gradient as well as a measure of the uncertainty in the gradient estimates, namely, the gradient covariance, are provided at little extra cost. Since the proposed Bayesian framework considers system trajectories as its basic observable unit, it does not require the dynamics within trajectories to be of any particular form, and thus, can be easily extended to partially observable problems. On the downside, it cannot take advantage of the Markov property when the system is Markovian. To address this issue, we proceed to supplement our Bayesian policy gradient framework with a new actor-critic learning model in which a Bayesian class of non- parametric critics, based on Gaussian process temporal difference learning, is used. Such critics model the action- value function as a Gaussian process, allowing Bayes' rule to be used in computing the posterior distribution over action-value functions, conditioned on the observed data. Appropriate choices of the policy parameterization and of the prior covariance (kernel) between action-values allow us to obtain closed-form expressions for the posterior distribution of the gradient of the expected return with respect to the policy parameters. We perform detailed experimental comparisons of the proposed Bayesian policy gradient and actor-critic algorithms with classic Monte-Carlo based policy gradient methods, as well as with each other, on a number of reinforcement learning problems.},

The main difficulty is that the mapping from the parameters to policies is both nonsmooth and highly redundant.

In this problem, each recommended item is a node and its expected rating is similar to its neighbors. The goal is to recommend items that have high expected ratings. We aim for the algorithms where the cumulative regret would not scale poorly with the number of nodes. In particular, we introduce the notion of an effective dimension, which is small in real-world graphs, and propose two algorithms for solving our problem that scale linearly in this dimension. Our experiments on real-world content recommendation problem show that a good estimator of user preferences for thousands of items can be learned from just tens nodes evaluations.},

The method is simple to describe: it randomly partitions a dataset of size N into m subsets of equal size, computes an independent kernel ridge regression estimator for each subset, then averages the local solutions into a global predictor. This partitioning leads to a substantial reduction in computation time versus the standard approach of performing kernel ridge regression on all N samples. Our two main theorems establish that despite the computational speed-up, statistical optimality is retained: as long as m is not too large, the partition-based estimator achieves the statistical minimax rate over all estimators using the set of N samples. As concrete examples, our theory guarantees that the number of processors m may grow nearly linearly for finite-rank kernels and Gaussian kernels and polynomially in N for Sobolev spaces, which in turn allows for substantial reductions in computational cost. We conclude with experiments on both simulated data and a music-prediction task that complement our theoretical results, exhibiting the computational and statistical benefits of our approach.},

abstract = {We consider online planning in Markov decision processes (MDPs). In online planning, the agent focuses on its current state only, deliberates about the set of possible policies from that state onwards and, when interrupted, uses the outcome of that exploratory deliberation to choose what action to perform next. The performance of algorithms for online planning is assessed in terms of simple regret, which is the agent's expected performance loss when the chosen action, rather than an optimal one, is followed. To date, state-of-the-art algorithms for online planning in general MDPs are either best effort, or guarantee only polynomial-rate reduction of simple regret over time. Here we introduce a new Monte-Carlo tree search algorithm, BRUE, that guarantees exponential-rate reduction of simple regret and error probability. This algorithm is based on a simple yet non-standard state-space sampling scheme, MCTS2e, in which different parts of each sample are dedicated to different exploratory objectives. Our empirical evaluation shows that BRUE not only provides superior performance guarantees, but is also very effective in practice and favorably compares to state-of-the-art. We then extend BRUE with a variant of "learning by forgetting." The resulting set of algorithms, BRUE(alpha), generalizes BRUE, improves the exponential factor in the upper bound on its reduction rate, and exhibits even more attractive empirical performance.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new deterministic approximation technique in Bayesian networks. This method, "Expectation Propagation", unifies two previous techniques: assumed-density filtering, an extension of the Kalman filter, and loopy belief propagation, an extension of belief propagation in Bayesian networks. All three algorithms try to recover an approximate distribution which is close in KL divergence to the true distribution. Loopy belief propagation, because it propagates exact belief states, is useful for a limited class of belief networks, such as those which are purely discrete. Expectation Propagation approximates the belief states by only retaining certain expectations, such as mean and variance, and iterates until these expectations are consistent throughout the network. This makes it applicable to hybrid networks with discrete and continuous nodes. Expectation Propagation also extends belief propagation in the opposite direction - it can propagate richer belief states that incorporate correlations between nodes. Experiments with Gaussian mixture models show Expectation Propagation to be convincingly better than methods with similar computational cost: Laplace's method, variational Bayes, and Monte Carlo. Expectation Propagation also provides an efficient algorithm for training Bayes point machine classifiers.},

Users of these networks often establish hundreds to even thousands of social links with other users. Recently, researchers have suggested examining the activity network— a network that is based on the actual interaction between users, rather than mere friendship—to distinguish between strong and weak links. While initial studies have led to in- sights on how an activity network is structurally different from the social network itself, a natural and important aspect of the activity network has been disregarded: the fact that over time social links can grow stronger or weaker. In this paper, we study the evolution of activity between users in the Facebook social network to capture this notion. We find that links in the activity network tend to come and go rapidly over time, and the strength of ties exhibits a general decreasing trend of activity as the social network link ages. For example, only 30{\%} of Facebook user pairs interact consistently from one month to the next. Interestingly, we also find that even though the links of the activity network change rapidly over time, many graph-theoretic properties of the activity network remain unchanged.},

We present Trace-UCB, an adaptive allocation algorithm that learns the noise levels while balancing contexts accordingly across the different linear functions, and derive guarantees for simple regret in both expectation and high-probability. Finally, we extend the algorithm and its guarantees to high dimensional settings, where the number of linear models times the dimension of the contextual space is higher than the total budget of samples.

abstract = {Numerous interaction techniques have been developed that make "virtual" pointing at targets in graphical user interfaces easier than analogous physical pointing tasks by invoking target-based interface modifications. These pointing facilitation techniques crucially depend on methods for estimating the relevance of potential targets. Unfortunately, many of the simple methods employed to date are inaccurate in common settings with many selectable targets in close proximity. In this paper, we bring recent advances in statistical machine learning to bear on this underlying target relevance estimation problem. By framing past target-driven pointing trajectories as approximate solutions to well-studied control problems, we learn the probabilistic dynamics of pointing trajectories that enable more accurate predictions of intended targets.},

We use sliding windows whose size, instead of being fixed a priori, is recomputed online according to the rate of change observed from the data in the window itself. This delivers the user or programmer from having to guess a time-scale for change. Contrary to many related works, we provide rigorous guarantees of performance, as bounds on the rates of false positives and false negatives. Using ideas from data stream algorithmics, we develop a time- and memory-efficient version of this algorithm, called ADWIN2. We show how to combine ADWIN2 with the Naive Bayes (NB) predictor, in two ways: one, using it to monitor the error rate of the current model and declare when revision is necessary and, two, putting it inside the NB predictor to maintain up-to-date estimations of conditional probabilities in the data. We test our approach using synthetic and real data streams.},

The algorithm can be improved to run in O ((n4EO+n5)log nM) time. The strongly polynomial version of this faster algorithm runs in O((n5EO + n6) log n) time for real valued general submodular functions. These are comparable to the best known running time bounds for submodular function minimization. The algorithm can also be implemented in strongly polynomial time using only additions, subtractions, comparisons, and the oracle calls for function evaluation.

This allows PlaTypOOS to be immune to two vulnerabilities of OLOP: failure when given underestimated ranges of noise and rewards and inefficiency when these are overestimated. PlaTypOOS additionally adapts to the global smoothness of the value function. PlaTypOOS acts in a provably more efficient manner vs. OLOP when OLOP is given an overestimated reward and show that in the case of no noise, PlaTypOOS learns exponentially faster.},

Of these one has, apart from size and position, a single parameter h, while the other is the limit to which it tends when h tends to zero.The appropriate limiting distribution in any case may be found from the manner in which the probability of exceeding any value x tends to zero as x is increased. For the normal distribution the limiting distribution has h = 0.From the normal distribution the limiting distribution is approached with extreme slowness; the final series of forms passed through as the ultimate form is approached may be represented by the series of limiting distributions in which h tends to zero in a definite manner as n increases to infinity.Numerical values are given for the comparison of the actual with the penultimate distributions for samples of 60 to 1000, and of the penultimate with the ultimate distributions for larger samples.},

We demonstrate that cascading a CNN with this representation performs on par with ImageNet classification models, commonly used in downstream tasks, such as the ResNet-50. We subsequently apply our trained hybrid ImageNet model as a base model on a detection system, which has typically larger image inputs.

In particular, we consider the case where the expert acts so as to maximize an unknown reward function defined as a linear combination of a set of state features. In this paper, we consider the setting where we observe many sample trajectories (i.e., sequences of states) but only one or a few of them are labeled as experts' trajectories. We investigate the conditions under which the remaining unlabeled trajectories can help in learning a policy with a good performance. In particular, we define an extension to the max-margin inverse reinforcement learning proposed by Abbeel and Ng (2004) where, at each iteration, the max-margin optimization step is replaced by a semi-supervised optimization problem which favors classifiers separating clusters of trajectories. Finally, we report empirical results on two grid-world domains showing that the semi-supervised algorithm is able to output a better policy in fewer iterations than the related algorithm that does not take the unlabeled trajectories into account.},

This leads to poor performance in theory and often in practice. Some recent approaches provide stronger guarantees in this setting, but remain somewhat unsatisfactory as they train either non-stationary or stochastic policies and require a large number of iterations. In this paper, we propose a new iterative algorithm, which trains a stationary deterministic policy, that can be seen as a no regret algorithm in an online learning setting. We show that any such no regret algorithm, combined with additional reduction assumptions, must find a policy with good performance under the distribution of observations it induces in such sequential settings. We demonstrate that this new approach outperforms previous approaches on two challenging imitation learning problems and a benchmark sequence labeling problem.},

We rst characterize the set of all reward functions for which a given policy is optimal. We then derive three algorithms for IRL. The rst two deal with the case where the entire policy is known; we handle tabulated reward functions on a nite state space and linear functional approximation of the reward function over a potentially in- nite state space.

abstract = {Classical collaborative filtering, and content-based filtering methods try to learn a static recommendation model given training data. These approaches are far from ideal in highly dynamic recommendation domains such as news recommendation and computational advertisement, where the set of items and users is very fluid. In this work, we investigate an adaptive clustering technique for content recommendation based on exploration-exploitation strategies in contextual multi-armed bandit settings. Our algorithm takes into account the collaborative effects that arise due to the interaction of the users with the items, by dynamically grouping users based on the items under consideration and, at the same time, grouping items based on the similarity of the clusterings induced over the users. The resulting algorithm thus takes advantage of preference patterns in the data in a way akin to collaborative filtering methods. We provide an empirical analysis on medium-size real-world datasets, showing scalability and increased prediction performance (as measured by click-through rate) over state-of-the-art methods for clustering bandits. We also provide a regret analysis within a standard linear stochastic noise setting.},

In this paper we propose and evaluate a generic ap- proach for guiding targeted crawling which is based on recent developments in Artificial Intelligence. Ourapproach, based on the recently introduced variant of the Multi-Armed Bandit problem with volatile arms(VMAB), aims to provide a proper balance between exploration and exploitation during the crawling process.

Experimental results indicate that our approach compares favorably with the best existing heuristics on two different domains.},

We show that when the reward is smooth over a given graph representing the neighboring actions, we can maximize the cumulative reward of learning while minimizing the sensing cost. In this paper we propose CheapUCB, an algorithm that matches the regret guarantees of the known algorithms for this setting and at the same time guarantees a linear cost again over them.

abstract = {We define a general framework for a large class of combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) problems, where subsets of base arms with unknown distributions form super arms. In each round, a super arm is played and the base arms contained in the super arm are played and their outcomes are observed. We further consider the extension in which more based arms could be probabilistically triggered based on the outcomes of already triggered arms. The reward of the super arm depends on the outcomes of all played arms, and it only needs to satisfy two mild assumptions, which allow a large class of nonlinear reward instances. We assume the availability of an offline ($\backslash$alpha,$\backslash$beta)-approximation oracle that takes the means of the outcome distributions of arms and outputs a super arm that with probability {\{}$\backslash$beta{\}} generates an {\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}} fraction of the optimal expected reward. The objective of an online learning algorithm for CMAB is to minimize ($\backslash$alpha,$\backslash$beta)-approximation regret, which is the difference between the $\backslash$alpha{\{}$\backslash$beta{\}} fraction of the expected reward when always playing the optimal super arm, and the expected reward of playing super arms according to the algorithm. We provide CUCB algorithm that achieves O(log n) distribution-dependent regret, where n is the number of rounds played, and we further provide distribution-independent bounds for a large class of reward functions. Our regret analysis is tight in that it matches the bound of UCB1 algorithm (up to a constant factor) for the classical MAB problem, and it significantly improves the regret bound in a earlier paper on combinatorial bandits with linear rewards. We apply our CMAB framework to two new applications, probabilistic maximum coverage and social influence maximization, both having nonlinear reward structures. In particular, application to social influence maximization requires our extension on probabilistically triggered arms.},

While sequential design of experiments is well studied in bandit theory, the most commonly optimized property is the regret with respect to the maximum mean reward. However, in other problems such as network intrusion detection, we are interested in detecting the most extreme value output by the sources. Therefore, in our work we study extreme regret which measures the efficiency of an algorithm compared to the oracle policy selecting the source with the heaviest tail.

@inproceedings{kannan2018greedy,
abstract = {Bandit learning is characterized by the tension between long-term exploration and short-term exploitation. However, as has recently been noted, in settings in which the choices of the learning algorithm correspond to important decisions about individual people (such as criminal recidivism prediction, lending, and sequential drug trials), exploration corresponds to explicitly sacrificing the well-being of one individual for the potential future benefit of others. This raises a fairness concern. In such settings, one might like to run a "greedy" algorithm, which always makes the (myopically) optimal decision for the individuals at hand - but doing this can result in a catastrophic failure to learn. In this paper, we consider the linear contextual bandit problem and revisit the performance of the greedy algorithm. We give a smoothed analysis, showing that even when contexts may be chosen by an adversary, small perturbations of the adversary's choices suffice for the algorithm to achieve "no regret", perhaps (depending on the specifics of the setting) with a constant amount of initial training data. This suggests that "generically" (i.e. in slightly perturbed environments), exploration and exploitation need not be in conflict in the linear setting.},

No further assumption is made regarding the smoothness and the structure of the expected reward function. For these problems, we propose the Stochastic Pentachotomy (SP) algorithm, and derive finite-time upper bounds on its regret and optimization error. In particular, we show that, for any expected reward function {\$}\backslashmu{\$} that behaves as {\$}\backslashmu(x)=\backslashmu(x{\^{}}\backslashstar)-C|x-x{\^{}}\backslashstar|{\^{}}\backslashxi{\$} locally around its maximizer {\$}x{\^{}}\backslashstar{\$} for some {\$}\backslashxi, C{\textgreater}0{\$}, the SP algorithm is order-optimal. Namely its regret and optimization error scale as {\$}O(\backslashsqrt{\{}T\backslashlog(T){\}}){\$} and {\$}O(\backslashsqrt{\{}\backslashlog(T)/T{\}}){\$}, respectively, when the time horizon {\$}T{\$} grows large. These scalings are achieved without the knowledge of {\$}\backslashxi{\$} and {\$}C{\$}. Our algorithm is based on asymptotically optimal sequential statistical tests used to successively trim an interval that contains the best arm with high probability. To our knowledge, the SP algorithm constitutes the first sequential arm selection rule that achieves a regret and optimization error scaling as {\$}O(\backslashsqrt{\{}T{\}}){\$} and {\$}O(1/\backslashsqrt{\{}T{\}}){\$}, respectively, up to a logarithmic factor for non-smooth expected reward functions, as well as for smooth functions with unknown smoothness.},

abstract = {Personalized web services strive to adapt their services (advertisements, news articles, etc) to individual users by making use of both content and user information. Despite a few recent advances, this problem remains challenging for at least two reasons. First, web service is featured with dynamically changing pools of content, rendering traditional collaborative filtering methods inapplicable. Second, the scale of most web services of practical interest calls for solutions that are both fast in learning and computation. In this work, we model personalized recommendation of news articles as a contextual bandit problem, a principled approach in which a learning algorithm sequentially selects articles to serve users based on contextual information about the users and articles, while simultaneously adapting its article-selection strategy based on user-click feedback to maximize total user clicks. The contributions of this work are three-fold. First, we propose a new, general contextual bandit algorithm that is computationally efficient and well motivated from learning theory. Second, we argue that any bandit algorithm can be reliably evaluated offline using previously recorded random traffic. Finally, using this offline evaluation method, we successfully applied our new algorithm to a Yahoo! Front Page Today Module dataset containing over 33 million events. Results showed a 12.5{\%} click lift compared to a standard context-free bandit algorithm, and the advantage becomes even greater when data gets more scarce.},

@article{Bao2016a,
abstract = {Social networks have been popular platforms for information propagation. An important use case is viral marketing: given a promotion budget, an advertiser can choose some influential users as the seed set and provide them free or discounted sample products; in this way, the advertiser hopes to increase the popularity of the product in the users' friend circles by the world-of-mouth effect, and thus maximizes the number of users that information of the production can reach. There has been a body of literature studying the influence maximization problem. Nevertheless, the existing studies mostly investigate the problem on a one-off basis, assuming fixed known influence probabilities among users, or the knowledge of the exact social network topology. In practice, the social network topology and the influence probabilities are typically unknown to the advertiser, which can be varying over time, i.e., in cases of newly established, strengthened or weakened social ties. In this paper, we focus on a dynamic non-stationary social network and design a randomized algorithm, RSB, based on multi-armed bandit optimization, to maximize influence propagation over time. The algorithm produces a sequence of online decisions and calibrates its explore-exploit strategy utilizing outcomes of previous decisions. It is rigorously proven to achieve an upper-bounded regret in reward and applicable to large-scale social networks. Practical effectiveness of the algorithm is evaluated using both synthetic and real-world datasets, which demonstrates that our algorithm outperforms previous stationary methods under non-stationary conditions.},

abstract = {We consider a variant of the well-studied multi-armed bandit problem in which the reward from each action evolves monotonically in the number of times the decision maker chooses to take that action. We are motivated by settings in which we must give a series of homogeneous tasks to a finite set of arms (workers) whose performance may improve (due to learning) or decay (due to loss of interest) with repeated trials. We assume that the arm-dependent rates at which the rewards change are unknown to the decision maker, and propose algorithms with provably optimal policy regret bounds, a much stronger notion than the often-studied external regret. For the case where the rewards are increasing and concave, we give an algorithm whose policy regret is sublinear and has a (provably necessary) dependence on the time re-quired to distinguish the optimal arm from the rest. We illustrate the behavior and performance of this algorithm via simulations. For the decreasing case, we present a simple greedy approach and show that the policy regret of this algorithm is constant and upper bounded by the number of arms.},

@inproceedings{garivier2011upper-confidence-bound,
abstract = {Many problems, such as cognitive radio, parameter control of a scanning tunnelling microscope or internet advertisement, can be modelled as non-stationary bandit problems where the distributions of rewards changes abruptly at unknown time instants. In this paper, we analyze two algorithms designed for solving this issue: discounted UCB (D-UCB) and sliding-window UCB (SW-UCB). We establish an upper-bound for the expected regret by upper-bounding the expectation of the number of times suboptimal arms are played. The proof relies on an interesting Hoeffding type inequality for self normalized deviations with a random number of summands. We establish a lower-bound for the regret in presence of abrupt changes in the arms reward distributions. We show that the discounted UCB and the sliding-window UCB both match the lower-bound up to a logarithmic factor. Numerical simulations show that D-UCB and SW-UCB perform significantly better than existing soft-max methods like EXP3.S.},

abstract = {Performance of machine learning algorithms depends critically on identifying a good set of hyperparameters. While current methods offer efficiencies by adaptively choosing new configurations to train, an alternative strategy is to adaptively allocate resources across the selected configurations. We formulate hyperparameter optimization as a pure-exploration non-stochastic infinitely many armed bandit problem where allocation of additional resources to an arm corresponds to training a configuration on larger subsets of the data. We introduce Hyperband for this framework and analyze its theoretical properties, providing several desirable guarantees. We compare Hyperband with state-of-the-art Bayesian optimization methods and a random search baseline on a comprehensive benchmark including 117 datasets. Our results on this benchmark demonstrate that while Bayesian optimization methods do not outperform random search trained for twice as long, Hyperband in favorable settings offers valuable speedups.},

abstract = {We propose stochastic rank-{\$}1{\$} bandits, a class of online learning problems where at each step a learning agent chooses a pair of row and column arms, and receives the product of their values as a reward. The main challenge of the problem is that the individual values of the row and column are unobserved. We assume that these values are stochastic and drawn independently. We propose a computationally-efficient algorithm for solving our problem, which we call Rank1Elim. We derive a {\$}O((K + L) (1 / \backslashDelta) \backslashlog n){\$} upper bound on its {\$}n{\$}-step regret, where {\$}K{\$} is the number of rows, {\$}L{\$} is the number of columns, and {\$}\backslashDelta{\$} is the minimum of the row and column gaps; under the assumption that the mean row and column rewards are bounded away from zero. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first bandit algorithm that finds the maximum entry of a rank-{\$}1{\$} matrix whose regret is linear in {\$}K + L{\$}, {\$}1 / \backslashDelta{\$}, and {\$}\backslashlog n{\$}. We also derive a nearly matching lower bound. Finally, we evaluate Rank1Elim empirically on multiple problems. We observe that it leverages the structure of our problems and can learn near-optimal solutions even if our modeling assumptions are mildly violated.},

abstract = {Multi-armed bandit problems are the most basic examples of sequential decision problems with an exploration-exploitation trade-off. This is the balance between staying with the option that gave highest payoffs in the past and exploring new options that might give higher payoffs in the future. Although the study of bandit problems dates back to the Thirties, exploration-exploitation trade-offs arise in several modern applications, such as ad placement, website optimization, and packet routing. Mathematically, a multi-armed bandit is defined by the payoff process associated with each option. In this survey, we focus on two extreme cases in which the analysis of regret is particularly simple and elegant: i.i.d. payoffs and adversarial payoffs. Besides the basic setting of finitely many actions, we also analyze some of the most important variants and extensions, such as the contextual bandit model.},

abstract = {The infinite arms bandit problem was initiated by Berry et al. (1997). They derived a regret lower bound of all solutions for Bernoulli rewards, and proposed various bandit strategies based on success runs, but which do not achieve this bound. We propose here a confidence bound target (CBT) algorithm that achieves extensions of their regret lower bound for general reward distributions and distribution priors. The algorithm does not require information on the reward distributions, for each arm we require only the mean and standard deviation of its rewards to compute a confidence bound. We play the arm with the smallest confidence bound provided it is smaller than a target mean. If the confidence bounds are all larger, then we play a new arm. We show how the target mean can be computed from the prior so that the smallest asymptotic regret, among all infinite arms bandit algorithms, is achieved. We also show that in the absence of information on the prior, the target mean can be determined empirically, and that the regret achieved is comparable to the smallest regret. Numerical studies show that CBT is versatile and outperforms its competitors.},

For example, the expensive real world behaviour of a robot can be approximated by a cheap computer simulation. We can use these approximations to eliminate low function value regions cheaply and use the expensive evaluations of {\$}f{\$} in a small but promising region and speedily identify the optimum.

We develop MF-GP-UCB, a novel method based on upper confidence bound techniques. In our theoretical analysis we demonstrate that it exhibits precisely the above behaviour, and achieves better regret than strategies which ignore multi-fidelity information. Empirically, MF-GP-UCB outperforms such naive strategies and other multi-fidelity methods on several synthetic and real experiments.},

We analyze GP-UCB, an intuitive upper-confidence based algorithm, and bound its cumulative regret in terms of maximal information gain, establishing a novel connection between GP optimization and experimental design. Moreover, by bounding the latter in terms of operator spectra, we obtain explicit sublinear regret bounds for many commonly used covariance functions. In some important cases, our bounds have surprisingly weak dependence on the dimensionality. In our experiments on real sensor data, GP-UCB compares favorably with other heuristical GP optimization approaches.},

Hyperparameter tuning of neural networks is particularly challenging, necessitating new approaches. To this end, we present a method that adaptively partitions the combined space of hyperparameters, context, and training resources (e.g., total number of training iterations). By adaptively partitioning the space, the algorithm is able to focus on the portions of the hyperparameter search space that are most relevant in a practical way. By including the resources in the combined space, the method tends to use fewer training resources overall. Our experiments show that this method can surpass state-of-the-art methods in tuning neural networks on benchmark datasets. In some cases, our implementations can achieve the same levels of accuracy on benchmark datasets as existing state-of-the-art approaches while saving over 50{\%} of our computational resources (e.g. time, training iterations).},

abstract = {This paper analyzes the problem of Gaussian process (GP) bandits with deterministic observations. The analysis uses a branch and bound algorithm that is related to the UCB algorithm of (Srinivas et al, 2010). For GPs with Gaussian observation noise, with variance strictly greater than zero, Srinivas et al proved that the regret vanishes at the approximate rate of {\$}O(1/\backslashsqrt{\{}t{\}}){\$}, where t is the number of observations. To complement their result, we attack the deterministic case and attain a much faster exponential convergence rate. Under some regularity assumptions, we show that the regret decreases asymptotically according to {\$}O(e{\^{}}{\{}-\backslashfrac{\{}\backslashtau t{\}}{\{}(\backslashln t){\^{}}{\{}d/4{\}}{\}}{\}}){\$} with high probability. Here, d is the dimension of the search space and tau is a constant that depends on the behaviour of the objective function near its global maximum.},

@book{Mary2015a,
abstract = {This paper addresses the on-line recommendation problem facing new users and new items; we assume that no information is available neither about users, nor about the items. The only source of information is a set of ratings given by users to some items. By on-line, we mean that the set of users, and the set of items, and the set of ratings is evolving along time and that at any moment, the recommendation system has to select items to recommend based on the currently available information, that is basically the sequence of past events. We also mean that each user comes with her preferences which may evolve along short and longer scales of time; so we have to continuously update their preferences. When the set of ratings is the only available source of information , the traditional approach is matrix factorization. In a decision making under uncertainty setting, actions should be selected to balance exploration with exploitation; this is best modeled as a bandit problem. Matrix factors provide a latent representation of users and items. These representations may then be used as contextual information by the bandit algorithm to select items. This last point is exactly the originality of this paper: the combination of matrix factorization and bandit algorithms to solve the on-line recommendation problem. Our work is driven by considering the recommendation problem as a feedback controlled loop. This leads to interactions between the representation learning, and the recommendation policy.},

@article{munos2014from,
abstract = {This work covers several aspects of the optimism in the face of uncertainty principle applied to large scale optimization problems under finite numerical budget. The initial motivation for the research reported here originated from the empirical success of the so-called Monte-Carlo Tree Search method popularized in computer-go and further extended to many other games as well as optimization and planning problems. Our objective is to contribute to the development of theoretical foundations of the field by characterizing the complexity of the underlying optimization problems and designing efficient algorithms with performance guarantees. The main idea presented here is that it is possible to decompose a complex decision making problem (such as an optimization problem in a large search space) into a sequence of elementary decisions, where each decision of the sequence is solved using a (stochastic) multi-armed bandit (simple mathematical model for decision making in stochastic environments). This so-called hierarchical bandit approach (where the reward observed by a bandit in the hierarchy is itself the return of another bandit at a deeper level) possesses the nice feature of starting the exploration by a quasi-uniform sampling of the space and then focusing progressively on the most promising area, at different scales, according to the evaluations observed so far, and eventually performing a local search around the global optima of the function. The performance of the method is assessed in terms of the optimality of the returned solution as a function of the number of function evaluations. Our main contribution to the field of function optimization is a class of hierarchical optimistic algorithms designed for general search spaces (such as metric spaces, trees, graphs, Euclidean spaces, ...) with different algorithmic instantiations depending on whether the evaluations are noisy or noiseless and whether some measure of the ''smoothness'' of the function is known or unknown. The performance of the algorithms depend on the local behavior of the function around its global optima expressed in terms of the quantity of near-optimal states measured with some metric. If this local smoothness of the function is known then one can design very efficient optimization algorithms (with convergence rate independent of the space dimension), and when it is not known, we can build adaptive techniques that can, in some cases, perform almost as well as when it is known.},

abstract = {We consider a generalization of stochastic bandits where the set of arms, cX, is allowed to be a generic measurable space and the mean-payoff function is "locally Lipschitz" with respect to a dissimilarity function that is known to the decision maker. Under this condition we construct an arm selection policy, called HOO (hierarchical optimistic optimization), with improved regret bounds compared to previous results for a large class of problems. In particular, our results imply that if cX is the unit hypercube in a Euclidean space and the mean-payoff function has a finite number of global maxima around which the behavior of the function is locally continuous with a known smoothness degree, then the expected regret of HOO is bounded up to a logarithmic factor by sqrtn, i.e., the rate of growth of the regret is independent of the dimension of the space. We also prove the minimax optimality of our algorithm when the dissimilarity is a metric. Our basic strategy has quadratic computational complexity as a function of the number of time steps and does not rely on the doubling trick. We also introduce a modified strategy, which relies on the doubling trick but runs in linearithmic time. Both results are improvements with respect to previous approaches.},

@inproceedings{katariya2017bernoulli,
abstract = {The probability that a user will click a search result depends both on its relevance and its position on the results page. The position based model explains this behavior by ascribing to every item an attraction probability, and to every position an examination probability. To be clicked, a result must be both attractive and examined. The probabilities of an item-position pair being clicked thus form the entries of a rank-{\$}1{\$} matrix. We propose the learning problem of a Bernoulli rank-{\$}1{\$} bandit where at each step, the learning agent chooses a pair of row and column arms, and receives the product of their Bernoulli-distributed values as a reward. This is a special case of the stochastic rank-{\$}1{\$} bandit problem considered in recent work that proposed an elimination based algorithm Rank1Elim, and showed that Rank1Elim's regret scales linearly with the number of rows and columns on "benign" instances. These are the instances where the minimum of the average row and column rewards {\$}\backslashmu{\$} is bounded away from zero. The issue with Rank1Elim is that it fails to be competitive with straightforward bandit strategies as {\$}\backslashmu \backslashrightarrow 0{\$}. In this paper we propose Rank1ElimKL which simply replaces the (crude) confidence intervals of Rank1Elim with confidence intervals based on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergences, and with the help of a novel result concerning the scaling of KL divergences we prove that with this change, our algorithm will be competitive no matter the value of {\$}\backslashmu{\$}. Experiments with synthetic data confirm that on benign instances the performance of Rank1ElimKL is significantly better than that of even Rank1Elim, while experiments with models derived from real data confirm that the improvements are significant across the board, regardless of whether the data is benign or not.},

abstract = {Thompson Sampling has recently been shown to be optimal in the Bernoulli Multi-Armed Bandit setting[Kaufmann et al., 2012]. This bandit problem assumes stationary distributions for the rewards. It is often unrealistic to model the real world as a stationary distribution. In this paper we derive and evaluate algorithms using Thompson Sampling for a Switching Multi-Armed Bandit Problem. We propose a Thompson Sampling strategy equipped with a Bayesian change point mechanism to tackle this problem. We develop algorithms for a variety of cases with constant switching rate: when switching occurs all arms change (Global Switching), switching occurs independently for each arm (Per-Arm Switching), when the switching rate is known and when it must be inferred from data. This leads to a family of algorithms we collectively term Change-Point Thompson Sampling (CTS). We show empirical results of the algorithm in 4 artificial environments, and 2 derived from real world data; news click-through[Yahoo!, 2011] and foreign exchange data[Dukascopy, 2012], comparing them to some other bandit algorithms. In real world data CTS is the most effective.},

In this paper, we investigate the online and stochastic version of such a problem, where in each iteration or round, we select a set of leaders and then observe a random realization of the corresponding reward, i.e., of the system performance. This problem is referred to as a stochastic matroid bandit, a variant of combinatorial multi-armed bandit problems where the underlying combinatorial structure is a matroid. We consider semi-bandit feedback and Bernoulli rewards, and derive a tight and problem-dependent lower bound on the regret of any consistent algorithm. We propose KL-OSM, a computationally efficient algorithm that exploits the matroid structure. We derive a finite-time upper bound of the regret of KL-OSM that improves the performance guarantees of existing algorithms. This upper bound actually matches our lower bound, i.e., KL-OSM is asymptotically optimal. Numerical experiments attest that KL-OSM outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in practice, and the difference in some cases is significant.},

This problem arises in numerous real-world applications, such as surveying and task routing in social networks, team formation in collaborative networks and experimental design with dependency constraints. Often the informativeness of a set of nodes can be quantified via a submodular utility function. Existing approaches for submodular optimization, however, require that the set of all nodes that can be selected is known ahead of time, which is often unrealistic. In contrast, we propose a novel model where we start our exploration from an initial node, and new nodes become visible and available for selection only once one of their neighbors has been chosen. We then present a general algorithm NetExp for this problem, and provide theoretical bounds on its performance dependent on structural properties of the underlying network. We evaluate our methodology on various simulated problem instances as well as on data collected from social question answering system deployed within a large enterprise.},

We show that these algorithms are essentially optimal since their regret decreases exponentially at a rate which is, up to a logarithmic factor, the best possible.

abstract = {Contextual bandits with linear payoffs, which are also known as linear bandits, provide a powerful alternative for solving practical problems of sequential decisions, e.g., online advertisements. In the era of big data, con- textual data usually tend to be high-dimensional, which leads to new challenges for traditional linear bandits mostly designed for the setting of low-dimensional con- textual data. Due to the curse of dimensionality, there are two challenges in most of the current bandit algo- rithms: the first is high time-complexity; and the sec- ond is extreme large upper regret bounds with high- dimensional data. In this paper, in order to attack the above two challenges effectively, we develop an algo- rithm of Contextual Bandits via RAndom Projection (CBRAP) in the setting of linear payoffs, which works especially for high-dimensional contextual data. The proposed CBRAP algorithm is time-efficient and flex- ible, because it enables players to choose an arm in a low-dimensional space, and relaxes the sparsity as- sumption of constant number of non-zero components in previous work. Besides, we prove an upper regret bound for the proposed algorithm, which is associ- ated with reduced dimensions. By comparing with three benchmark algorithms, we demonstrate improved per- formance on cumulative payoffs of CBRAP during its sequential decisions on both synthetic and real-world datasets, as well as its superior time-efficiency.

The current paradigm of multi-armed bandit analysis does not take these known patterns into account, which means that despite the firm theoretical foundation of these methods, they are fundamentally flawed when it comes to real applications. This work provides a remedy that takes the time-dependent patterns into account, and we show how this remedy is implemented in the UCB and {\{}$\backslash$epsilon{\}}-greedy methods. In the corrected methods, exploitation (greed) is regulated over time, so that more exploitation occurs during higher reward periods, and more exploration occurs in periods of low reward. In order to understand why regret is reduced with the corrected methods, we present a set of bounds that provide insight into why we would want to exploit during periods of high reward, and discuss the impact on regret. Our proposed methods have excellent performance in experiments, and were inspired by a high-scoring entry in the Exploration and Exploitation 3 contest using data from Yahoo! Front Page. That entry heavily used time-series methods to regulate greed over time, which was substantially more effective than other contextual bandit methods.},

abstract = {In a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem, an online algorithm makes a sequence of choices. In each round it chooses from a time-invariant set of alternatives and receives the payoff associated with this alternative. While the case of small strategy sets is by now well-understood, a lot of recent work has focused on MAB problems with exponentially or infinitely large strategy sets, where one needs to assume extra structure in order to make the problem tractable. In particular, recent literature considered information on similarity between arms. We consider similarity information in the setting of "contextual bandits", a natural extension of the basic MAB problem where before each round an algorithm is given the "context" - a hint about the payoffs in this round. Contextual bandits are directly motivated by placing advertisements on webpages, one of the crucial problems in sponsored search. A particularly simple way to represent similarity information in the contextual bandit setting is via a "similarity distance" between the context-arm pairs which gives an upper bound on the difference between the respective expected payoffs. Prior work on contextual bandits with similarity uses "uniform" partitions of the similarity space, which is potentially wasteful. We design more efficient algorithms that are based on adaptive partitions adjusted to "popular" context and "high-payoff" arms.},

At the same time, the opponent chooses a loss vector in Rd and the forecaster suffers a loss that is the inner product of the two vectors. The goal of the forecaster is to achieve that, in the long run, the accumulated loss is not much larger than that of the best possible element in S. We consider the bandit setting in which the forecaster only has access to the losses of the chosen vectors (i.e., the entire loss vectors are not observed). We introduce a variant of a strategy by Dani, Hayes and Kakade achieving a regret bound that, for a variety of concrete choices of S, is of order √ndln|S| where n is the time horizon. This is not improvable in general and is better than previously known bounds. The examples we consider are all such that S⊂{\{} 0,1{\}}d, and we show how the combinatorial structure of these classes can be exploited to improve the regret bounds.

abstract = {Thompson Sampling has been demonstrated in many complex bandit models, however the theoretical guarantees available for the parametric multi-armed bandit are still limited to the Bernoulli case. Here we extend them by proving asymptotic optimality of the algorithm using the Jeffreys prior for 1-dimensional exponential family bandits. Our proof builds on previous work, but also makes extensive use of closed forms for Kullback-Leibler divergence and Fisher information (and thus Jeffreys prior) available in an exponential family. This allow us to give a finite time exponential concentration inequality for posterior distributions on exponential families that may be of interest in its own right. Moreover our analysis covers some distributions for which no optimistic algorithm has yet been proposed, including heavy-tailed exponential families.},

abstract = {If one possesses a model of a controlled deterministic system, then from any state, one may consider the set of all possible reachable states starting from that state and using any sequence of actions. This forms a tree whose size is exponential in the planning time horizon. Here we ask the question: given finite computational resources (e.g. CPU time), which may not be known ahead of time, what is the best way to explore this tree, such that once all resources have been used, the algorithm would be able to propose an action (or a sequence of actions) whose performance is as close as possible to optimality? The performance with respect to optimality is assessed in terms of the regret (with respect to the sum of discounted future rewards) resulting from choosing the action returned by the algorithm instead of an optimal action. In this paper we investigate an optimistic exploration of the tree, where the most promising states are explored first, and compare this approach to a naive uniform exploration. Bounds on the regret are derived both for uniform and optimistic exploration strategies. Numerical simulations illustrate the benefit of optimistic planning.},

We resolve a serious issue in the prior CMAB-T studies where the regret bounds contain a possibly exponentially large factor of {\$}1/p{\^{}}*{\$}, where {\$}p{\^{}}*{\$} is the minimum positive probability that an arm is triggered by any action. We address this issue by introducing triggering probability moderated (TPM) bounded smoothness conditions into the general CMAB-T framework, and show that many applications such as influence maximization bandit and combinatorial cascading bandit satisfy such TPM conditions. As a result, we completely remove the factor of {\$}1/p{\^{}}*{\$} from the regret bounds, achieving significantly better regret bounds for influence maximization and cascading bandits than before. Finally, we provide lower bound results showing that the factor {\$}1/p{\^{}}*{\$} is unavoidable for general CMAB-T problems, suggesting that TPM conditions are crucial in removing this factor.},

Even though this version of the problem provides a more realistic model for most real-world applications, it cannot be optimally solved in practice since it is known to be PSPACE-hard. The objective of this paper is to characterize special sub-classes of the problem where good approximate solutions can be found using tractable approaches. Specifically, it is shown that in the case where the joint distribution over the arms is {\$}\backslashvarphi{\$}-mixing, and under some conditions on the {\$}\backslashvarphi{\$}-mixing coefficients, a modified version of UCB can prove optimal. On the other hand, it is shown that when the pay-off distributions are strongly dependent, simple switching strategies may be devised which leverage the strong inter-dependencies. To this end, an example is provided using Gaussian Processes. The techniques developed in this paper apply, more generally, to the problem of online sampling under dependence.},

abstract = {We consider stochastic multi-armed bandit problems with complex actions over a set of basic arms, where the decision maker plays a complex action rather than a basic arm in each round. The reward of the complex action is some function of the basic arms' rewards, and the feedback observed may not necessarily be the reward per-arm. For instance, when the complex actions are subsets of the arms, we may only observe the maximum reward over the chosen subset. Thus, feedback across complex actions may be coupled due to the nature of the reward function. We prove a frequentist regret bound for Thompson sampling in a very general setting involving parameter, action and observation spaces and a likelihood function over them. The bound holds for discretely-supported priors over the parameter space and without additional structural properties such as closed-form posteriors, conjugate prior structure or independence across arms. The regret bound scales logarithmically with time but, more importantly, with an improved constant that non-trivially captures the coupling across complex actions due to the structure of the rewards. As applications, we derive improved regret bounds for classes of complex bandit problems involving selecting subsets of arms, including the first nontrivial regret bounds for nonlinear MAX reward feedback from subsets.},

abstract = {We study the multi-armed bandit problems with budget constraint and variable costs (MAB-BV). In this setting, pulling an arm will receive a random reward together with a random cost, and the objective of an algorithm is to pull a sequence of arms in order to maximize the expected total reward with the costs of pulling those arms complying with a budget constraint. This new setting models many Internet applications (e.g., ad exchange, sponsored search, and cloud computing) in a more accurate manner than previous settings where the pulling of arms is either costless or with a fixed cost.We propose two UCB based algorithms for the new setting. The first algorithm needs prior knowledge about the lower bound of the expected costs when computing the exploration term. The second algorithm eliminates this need by estimating the minimal expected costs from empirical observations, and therefore can be applied to more real-world applications where pri- or knowledge is not available.We prove that both algorithms have nice learning abilities, with regret bounds of O(lnB). Furthermore, we show that when applying our proposed algorithms to a previous setting with fixed costs (which can be regarded as our special case), one can improve the previously obtained regret bound. Our simulation results on real-time bidding in ad exchange verify the effectiveness of the algorithms and are consistent with our theoretical analysis},

We show in this paper that methods derived from this second per-spective prove optimal when evaluated using the frequentist cumulated regret as a mea-sure of performance. We give a general for-mulation for a class of Bayesian index policies that rely on quantiles of the posterior distri-bution. For binary bandits, we prove that the corresponding algorithm, termed Bayes-UCB, satisfies finite-time regret bounds that imply its asymptotic optimality. More gen-erally, Bayes-UCB appears as an unifying framework for several variants of the UCB algorithm addressing different bandit prob-lems (parametric multi-armed bandits, Gaus-sian bandits with unknown mean and vari-ance, linear bandits). But the generality of the Bayesian approach makes it possible to address more challenging models. In par-ticular, we show how to handle linear ban-dits with sparsity constraints by resorting to Gibbs sampling.},

@article{gai2012combinatorial,
abstract = {In the classic multi-armed bandits problem, the goal is to have a policy for dynamically operating arms that each yield stochastic rewards with unknown means. The key metric of interest is regret, defined as the gap between the expected total reward accumulated by an omniscient player that knows the reward means for each arm, and the expected total reward accumulated by the given policy. The policies presented in prior work have storage, computation and regret all growing linearly with the number of arms, which is not scalable when the number of arms is large. We consider in this work a broad class of multi-armed bandits with dependent arms that yield rewards as a linear combination of a set of unknown parameters. For this general framework, we present efficient policies that are shown to achieve regret that grows logarithmically with time, and polynomially in the number of unknown parameters (even though the number of dependent arms may grow exponentially). Furthermore, these policies only require storage that grows linearly in the number of unknown parameters. We show that this generalization is broadly applicable and useful for many interesting tasks in networks that can be formulated as tractable combinatorial optimization problems with linear objective functions, such as maximum weight matching, shortest path, and minimum spanning tree computations.},

abstract = {Influence maximization is the problem of finding influential users, or nodes, in a graph so as to maximize the spread of information. It has many applications in advertising and marketing on social networks. In this paper, we study a highly generic version of influence maximization, one of optimizing influence campaigns by sequentially selecting "spread seeds" from a set of influencers, a small subset of the node population, under the hypothesis that, in a given campaign, previously activated nodes remain "persistently" active throughout and thus do not yield further rewards. This problem is in particular relevant for an important form of online marketing, known as influencer marketing, in which the marketers target a sub-population of influential people, instead of the entire base of potential buyers. Importantly, we make no assumptions on the underlying diffusion model and we work in a setting where neither a diffusion network nor historical activation data are available. We call this problem online influencer marketing with persistence (in short, OIMP). We first discuss motivating scenarios and present our general approach. We introduce an estimator on the influencers' remaining potential -- the expected number of nodes that can still be reached from a given influencer -- and justify its strength to rapidly estimate the desired value, relying on real data gathered from Twitter. We then describe a novel algorithm, GT-UCB, relying on upper confidence bounds on the remaining potential. We show that our approach leads to high-quality spreads on both simulated and real datasets, even though it makes almost no assumptions on the diffusion medium. Importantly, it is orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art influence maximization methods, making it possible to deal with large-scale online scenarios.},

Each time an agent takes an action, the corresponding reward is instantaneously observed by the agent, as well as its neighbours in the social network. We perform a regret analysis of various policies in this collaborative learning setting. A key finding of this paper is that natural extensions of widely-studied single agent learning policies to the network setting need not perform well in terms of regret. In particular, we identify a class of non-altruistic and individually consistent policies, and argue by deriving regret lower bounds that they are liable to suffer a large regret in the networked setting. We also show that the learning performance can be substantially improved if the agents exploit the structure of the network, and develop a simple learning algorithm based on dominating sets of the network. Specifically, we first consider a star network, which is a common motif in hierarchical social networks, and show analytically that the hub agent can be used as an information sink to expedite learning and improve the overall regret. We also derive networkwide regret bounds for the algorithm applied to general networks. We conduct numerical experiments on a variety of networks to corroborate our analytical results.},

abstract = {The contextual bandit literature has traditionally focused on algorithms that address the exploration-exploitation tradeoff. In particular, greedy algorithms that exploit current estimates without any exploration may be sub-optimal in general. However, exploration-free greedy algorithms are desirable in practical settings where exploration may be costly or unethical (e.g., clinical trials). Surprisingly, we find that a simple greedy algorithm can be rate-optimal (achieves asymptotically optimal regret) if there is sufficient randomness in the observed contexts (covariates). We prove that this is always the case for a two-armed bandit under a general class of context distributions that satisfy a condition we term {\$}\backslashtextit{\{}covariate diversity{\}}{\$}. Furthermore, even absent this condition, we show that a greedy algorithm can be rate optimal with positive probability. Thus, standard bandit algorithms may unnecessarily explore. Motivated by these results, we introduce Greedy-First, a new algorithm that uses only observed contexts and rewards to determine whether to follow a greedy algorithm or to explore. We prove that this algorithm is rate-optimal without any additional assumptions on the context distribution or the number of arms. Extensive simulations demonstrate that Greedy-First successfully reduces exploration and outperforms existing (exploration-based) contextual bandit algorithms such as Thompson sampling or upper confidence bound (UCB).},

In this paper, we extend the Thompson sampling to Budgeted MAB, where there is random cost for pulling an arm and the total cost is constrained by a budget. We start with the case of Bernoulli bandits, in which the random rewards (costs) of an arm are independently sampled from a Bernoulli distribution. To implement the Thompson sampling algorithm in this case, at each round, we sample two numbers from the posterior distributions of the reward and cost for each arm, obtain their ratio, select the arm with the maximum ratio, and then update the posterior distributions. We prove that the distribution-dependent regret bound of this algorithm is {\$}O(\backslashln B){\$}, where {\$}B{\$} denotes the budget. By introducing a Bernoulli trial, we further extend this algorithm to the setting that the rewards (costs) are drawn from general distributions, and prove that its regret bound remains almost the same. Our simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

abstract = {Motivated by online recommendation and advertising systems, we consider a causal model for stochastic contextual bandits with a latent low-dimensional confounder. In our model, there are {\$}L{\$} observed contexts and {\$}K{\$} arms of the bandit. The observed context influences the reward obtained through a latent confounder variable with cardinality {\$}m{\$} ({\$}m \backslashll L,K{\$}). The arm choice and the latent confounder causally determines the reward while the observed context is correlated with the confounder. Under this model, the {\$}L \backslashtimes K{\$} mean reward matrix {\$}\backslashmathbf{\{}U{\}}{\$} (for each context in {\$}[L]{\$} and each arm in {\$}[K]{\$}) factorizes into non-negative factors {\$}\backslashmathbf{\{}A{\}}{\$} ({\$}L \backslashtimes m{\$}) and {\$}\backslashmathbf{\{}W{\}}{\$} ({\$}m \backslashtimes K{\$}). This insight enables us to propose an {\$}\backslashepsilon{\$}-greedy NMF-Bandit algorithm that designs a sequence of interventions (selecting specific arms), that achieves a balance between learning this low-dimensional structure and selecting the best arm to minimize regret. Our algorithm achieves a regret of {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}O{\}}\backslashleft(L\backslashmathrm{\{}poly{\}}(m, \backslashlog K) \backslashlog T \backslashright){\$} at time {\$}T{\$}, as compared to {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}O{\}}(LK\backslashlog T){\$} for conventional contextual bandits, assuming a constant gap between the best arm and the rest for each context. These guarantees are obtained under mild sufficiency conditions on the factors that are weaker versions of the well-known Statistical RIP condition. We further propose a class of generative models that satisfy our sufficient conditions, and derive a lower bound of {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}O{\}}\backslashleft(Km\backslashlog T\backslashright){\$}. These are the first regret guarantees for online matrix completion with bandit feedback, when the rank is greater than one. We further compare the performance of our algorithm with the state of the art, on synthetic and real world data-sets.},

abstract = {Multi-armed bandit problems are the predominant theoretical model of exploration-exploitation tradeoffs in learning, and they have countless applications ranging from medical trials, to communication networks, to Web search and advertising. In many of these application domains the learner may be constrained by one or more supply (or budget) limits, in addition to the customary limitation on the time horizon. The literature lacks a general model encompassing these sorts of problems. We introduce such a model, called "bandits with knapsacks", that combines aspects of stochastic integer programming with online learning. A distinctive feature of our problem, in comparison to the existing regret-minimization literature, is that the optimal policy for a given latent distribution may significantly outperform the policy that plays the optimal fixed arm. Consequently, achieving sub linear regret in the bandits-with-knapsacks problem is significantly more challenging than in conventional bandit problems. We present two algorithms whose reward is close to the information-theoretic optimum: one is based on a novel "balanced exploration" paradigm, while the other is a primal-dual algorithm that uses multiplicative updates. Further, we prove that the regret achieved by both algorithms is optimal up to polylogarithmic factors. We illustrate the generality of the problem by presenting applications in a number of different domains including electronic commerce, routing, and scheduling. As one example of a concrete application, we consider the problem of dynamic posted pricing with limited supply and obtain the first algorithm whose regret, with respect to the optimal dynamic policy, is sub linear in the supply.},

abstract = {Online advertising and product recommendation are important domains of applications for multi-armed bandit methods. In these fields, the reward that is immediately available is most often only a proxy for the actual outcome of interest, which we refer to as a conversion. For instance, in web advertising, clicks can be observed within a few seconds after an ad display but the corresponding sale --if any-- will take hours, if not days to happen. This paper proposes and investigates a new stochas-tic multi-armed bandit model in the framework proposed by Chapelle (2014) --based on empirical studies in the field of web advertising-- in which each action may trigger a future reward that will then happen with a stochas-tic delay. We assume that the probability of conversion associated with each action is unknown while the distribution of the conversion delay is known, distinguishing between the (idealized) case where the conversion events may be observed whatever their delay and the more realistic setting in which late conversions are censored. We provide performance lower bounds as well as two simple but efficient algorithms based on the UCB and KLUCB frameworks. The latter algorithm, which is preferable when conversion rates are low, is based on a Poissonization argument, of independent interest in other settings where aggregation of Bernoulli observations with different success probabilities is required.},

abstract = {We consider the restless Markov bandit problem, in which the state of each arm evolves according to a Markov process independently of the learner's actions. We suggest an algorithm, that first represents the setting as an MDP which exhibits some special structural properties. In order to grasp this information we introduce the notion of $\epsilon$-structured MDPs, which are a generalization of concepts like (approximate) state aggregation and MDP homomorphisms. We propose a general algorithm for learning $\epsilon$-structured MDPs and show regret bounds that demonstrate that additional structural information enhances learning.Applied to the restless bandit setting, this algorithm achieves after any T steps regret of order O{\~{}}(T) with respect to the best policy that knows the distributions of all arms. We make no assumptions on the Markov chains underlying each arm except that they are irreducible. In addition, we show that index-based policies are necessarily suboptimal for the considered problem.},

The new algorithm is tested empirically in a large-scale, real-world dataset. Second, we give a new algorithm called VE that competes with a possibly infinite set of policies of VC-dimension d while incurring regret at most O(sqrtT(dln(T) + ln (1/delta))) with probability {\$}1-delta.

abstract = {Bayesian optimization is a powerful global optimization technique for expensive black-box functions. One of its shortcomings is that it requires auxiliary optimization of an acquisition function at each iteration. This auxiliary optimization can be costly and very hard to carry out in practice. Moreover, it creates serious theoretical concerns, as most of the convergence results assume that the exact optimum of the acquisition function can be found. In this paper, we introduce a new technique for efficient global optimization that combines Gaussian process confidence bounds and treed simultaneous optimistic optimization to eliminate the need for auxiliary optimization of acquisition functions. The experiments with global optimization benchmarks and a novel application to automatic information extraction demonstrate that the resulting technique is more efficient than the two approaches from which it draws inspiration. Unlike most theoretical analyses of Bayesian optimization with Gaussian processes, our finite-time convergence rate proofs do not require exact optimization of an acquisition function. That is, our approach eliminates the unsatisfactory assumption that a difficult, potentially NP-hard, problem has to be solved in order to obtain vanishing regret rates.},

The Boltzmann softmax operator is the most commonly used softmax operator in this setting, but we show that this operator is prone to misbehavior. In this work, we study an alternative softmax operator that, among other properties, is both a non-expansion (ensuring convergent behavior in learning and planning) and differentiable (making it possible to improve decisions via gradient descent methods).

The decision maker's objective is to maximize her cumulative expected reward over the time horizon. The MAB problem has been studied extensively, specifically under the assumption of the arms' rewards distributions being stationary, or quasi-stationary, over time. We consider a variant of the MAB framework, which we termed Rotting Bandits, where each arm's expected reward decays as a function of the number of times it has been pulled. We are motivated by many real-world scenarios such as online advertis-ing, content recommendation, crowdsourcing, and more.

Here we introduce a new approach to computer Go that uses ‘value networks' to evaluate board positions and ‘policy networks' to select moves. These deep neural networks are trained by a novel combination of supervised learning from human expert games, and reinforcement learning from games of self-play. Without any lookahead search, the neural networks play Go at the level of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tree search programs that simulate thousands of random games of self-play. We also introduce a new search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo simulation with value and policy networks. Using this search algorithm, our program AlphaGo achieved a 99.8{\%} winning rate against other Go programs, and defeated the human European Go champion by 5 games to 0. This is the first time that a computer program has defeated a human professional player in the full-sized game of Go, a feat previously thought to be at least a decade away.},

abstract = {Social networks are commonly used for marketing purposes. For example, free samples of a product can be given to a few influential social network users (or "seed nodes"), with the hope that they will convince their friends to buy it. One way to formalize marketers' objective is through influence maximization (or IM), whose goal is to find the best seed nodes to activate under a fixed budget, so that the number of people who get influenced in the end is maximized. Recent solutions to IM rely on the influence probability that a user influences another one. However, this probability information may be unavailable or incomplete. In this paper, we study IM in the absence of complete information on influence probability. We call this problem Online Influence Maximization (OIM) since we learn influence probabilities at the same time we run influence campaigns. To solve OIM, we propose a multiple-trial approach, where (1) some seed nodes are selected based on existing influence information; (2) an influence campaign is started with these seed nodes; and (3) users' feedback is used to update influence information. We adopt the Explore-Exploit strategy, which can select seed nodes using either the current influence probability estimation (exploit), or the confidence bound on the estimation (explore). Any existing IM algorithm can be used in this framework. We also develop an incremental algorithm that can significantly reduce the overhead of handling users' feedback information. Our experiments show that our solution is more effective than traditional IM methods on the partial information.},

abstract = {Poker is a family of games that exhibit imperfect information, where players do not have full knowledge of past events. Whereas many perfect-information games have been solved (e.g., Connect Four and checkers), no nontrivial imperfect-information game played competitively by humans has previously been solved. Here, we announce that heads-up limit Texas hold'em is now essentially weakly solved. Furthermore, this computation formally proves the common wisdom that the dealer in the game holds a substantial advantage. This result was enabled by a new algorithm, CFR+, which is capable of solving extensive-form games orders of magnitude larger than previously possible. I'll see your program and raise you mine One of the fundamental differences between playing chess and two-handed poker is that the chessboard and the pieces on it are visible throughout the entire game, but an opponent's cards in poker are private. This informational deficit increases the complexity and the uncertainty in calculating the best course of action—to raise, to fold, or to call. Bowling et al. now report that they have developed a computer program that can do just that for the heads-up variant of poker known as Limit Texas Hold 'em (see the Perspective by Sandholm).

The few papers that propose algorithms for learning these probabilities assume the availability of a batch of diffusion cascades and learn the probabilities offline. We tackle the real but difficult problems of (i)learning in influence probabilities and (ii) maximizing influence spread, when no cascades are available as input, by adopting a combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) paradigm. We formulate the above problems respectively as network exploration, i.e., minimizing the error in learned influence probabilities, and minimization of loss in spread from choosing suboptimal seed sets over the rounds of a CMAB game. We propose algorithms for both problems and establish bounds on their performance. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed algorithms via a comprehensive set of experiments over three real datasets.},

abstract = {Gaussian processes (GP) are a popular Bayesian approach for the optimization of black-box functions. Despite their effectiveness in simple problems, GP-based algorithms hardly scale to complex high-dimensional functions, as their per-iteration time and space cost is at least quadratic in the number of dimensions d and iterations t. Given a set of A alternative to choose from, the overall runtime O(t3A) quickly becomes prohibitive. In this paper, we introduce BKB (budgeted kernelized bandit), a novel approximate GP algorithm for optimization under bandit feedback that achieves near-optimal regret (and hence near-optimal convergence rate) with near-constant per-iteration complexity and no assumption on the input space or covariance of the GP. 
Combining a kernelized linear bandit algorithm (GP-UCB) with randomized matrix sketching technique (i.e., leverage score sampling), we prove that selecting inducing points based on their posterior variance gives an accurate low-rank approximation of the GP, preserving variance estimates and confidence intervals. As a consequence, BKB does not suffer from variance starvation, an important problem faced by many previous sparse GP approximations. Moreover, we show that our procedure selects at most Õ (deff) points, where deff is the effective dimension of the explored space, which is typically much smaller than both d and t. This greatly reduces the dimensionality of the problem, thus leading to a O(TAd2eff) runtime and O(Adeff) space complexity.},

abstract = {We consider online learning problems under a a partial observability model capturing situations where the information conveyed to the learner is between full information and bandit feedback. In the simplest variant, we assume that in addition to its own loss, the learner also gets to observe losses of some other actions. The revealed losses depend on the learner's action and a directed observation system chosen by the environment. For this setting, we propose the first algorithm that enjoys near-optimal regret guarantees without having to know the observation system before selecting its actions. Along similar lines, we also define a new partial information setting that models online combinatorial optimization problems where the feedback received by the learner is between semi-bandit and full feedback. As the predictions of our first algorithm cannot be always computed efficiently in this setting, we propose another algorithm with similar properties and with the benefit of always being computationally efficient, at the price of a slightly more complicated tuning mechanism. Both algorithms rely on a novel exploration strategy called implicit exploration, which is shown to be more efficient both computationally and information-theoretically than previously studied exploration strategies for the problem.},

This paper proposes a new global optimization algorithm, called Locally Oriented Global Optimization (LOGO), to aim for both fast convergence in practice and finite-time error bound in theory. The advantage and usage of the new algorithm are illustrated via theoretical analysis and an experiment conducted with 11 benchmark test functions. Further, we modify the LOGO algorithm to specifically solve a planning problem via policy search with continuous state/action space and long time horizon while maintaining its finite-time error bound. We apply the proposed planning method to accident management of a nuclear power plant. The result of the application study demonstrates the practical utility of our method.},

abstract = {Thompson Sampling is one of the oldest heuristics for multi-armed bandit problems. It is a randomized algorithm based on Bayesian ideas, and has recently generated significant interest after several studies demonstrated it to have better empirical performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods. However, many questions regarding its theoretical performance remained open. In this paper, we design and analyze a generalization of Thompson Sampling algorithm for the stochastic contextual multi-armed bandit problem with linear payoff functions, when the contexts are provided by an adaptive adversary. This is among the most important and widely studied versions of the contextual bandits problem. We provide the first theoretical guarantees for the contextual version of Thompson Sampling. We prove a high probability regret bound of {\$}\backslashtilde{\{}O{\}}(d{\^{}}{\{}3/2{\}}\backslashsqrt{\{}T{\}}){\$} (or {\$}\backslashtilde{\{}O{\}}(d\backslashsqrt{\{}T \backslashlog(N){\}}){\$}), which is the best regret bound achieved by any computationally efficient algorithm available for this problem in the current literature, and is within a factor of {\$}\backslashsqrt{\{}d{\}}{\$} (or {\$}\backslashsqrt{\{}\backslashlog(N){\}}{\$}) of the information-theoretic lower bound for this problem.},

However, in practice, actions can consist of picking subsets of readings from sensors that may break from time to time, road segments that can be blocked or goods that are out of stock. In this paper we study learning algorithms that are able to deal with stochastic availability of such unreliable composite actions. We propose and analyze algorithms based on the Follow-The-Perturbed-Leader prediction method for several learning settings differing in the feedback provided to the learner. Our algorithms rely on a novel loss estimation technique that we call Counting Asleep Times. We deliver regret bounds for our algorithms for the previously studied full information and (semi-)bandit settings, as well as a natural middle point between the two that we call the restricted information setting. A special consequence of our results is a significant improvement of the best known performance guarantees achieved by an efficient algorithm for the sleeping bandit problem with stochastic availability. Finally, we evaluate our algorithms empirically and show their improvement over the known approaches.},

abstract = {We consider the framework of stochastic multi-armed bandit problems and study the possibilities and limitations of forecasters that perform an on-line exploration of the arms. These forecasters are assessed in terms of their simple regret, a regret notion that captures the fact that exploration is only constrained by the number of available rounds (not necessarily known in advance), in contrast to the case when the cumulative regret is considered and when exploitation needs to be performed at the same time. We believe that this performance criterion is suited to situations when the cost of pulling an arm is expressed in terms of resources rather than rewards. We discuss the links between the simple and the cumulative regret. One of the main results in the case of a finite number of arms is a general lower bound on the simple regret of a forecaster in terms of its cumulative regret: the smaller the latter, the larger the former. Keeping this result in mind, we then exhibit upper bounds on the simple regret of some forecasters. The paper ends with a study devoted to continuous-armed bandit problems; we show that the simple regret can be minimized with respect to a family of probability distributions if and only if the cumulative regret can be minimized for it. Based on this equivalence, we are able to prove that the separable metric spaces are exactly the metric spaces on which these regrets can be minimized with respect to the family of all probability distributions with continuous mean-payoff functions. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We consider stochastic multi-armed bandit problems with complex actions over a set of basic arms, where the decision maker plays a complex action rather than a basic arm in each round. The reward of the complex action is some function of the basic arms' rewards, and the feedback observed may not necessarily be the reward per-arm. For instance, when the complex actions are subsets of the arms, we may only observe the maximum reward over the chosen subset. Thus, feedback across complex actions may be coupled due to the nature of the reward function. We prove a frequentist regret bound for Thompson sampling in a very general setting involving parameter, action and observation spaces and a likelihood function over them. The bound holds for discretely-supported priors over the parameter space and without additional structural properties such as closed-form posteriors, conjugate prior structure or independence across arms. The regret bound scales logarithmically with time but, more importantly, with an improved constant that non-trivially captures the coupling across complex actions due to the structure of the rewards. As applications, we derive improved regret bounds for classes of complex bandit problems involving selecting subsets of arms, including the first nontrivial regret bounds for nonlinear MAX reward feedback from subsets.},

The algorithms can select which option to generate the next sample from in order to produce estimates with equally good precision for all the distributions. When an algorithm uses sample means to estimate the unknown values then the optimal solution, assuming full knowledge of the distributions, is to sample each option proportional to its variance. In this paper we propose an incremental algorithm that asymptotically achieves the same loss as an optimal rule. We prove that the excess loss suffered by this algorithm, apart from logarithmic factors, scales as n − 3/2 , which we conjecture to be the optimal rate.

The algorithm is widely known to be too greedy, but nevertheless enjoys wide use due to its simplicity and ability to handle uncertainty and noise in a coherent decision theoretic framework. To provide rigorous insight into EI, we study its properties in a simple setting of Bayesian optimization where the domain consists of a finite grid of points. This is the so-called best-arm identification problem, where the goal is to allocate measurement effort wisely to confidently identify the best arm using a small number of measurements. In this framework, one can show formally that EI is far from optimal. To overcome this shortcoming, we introduce a simple modification of the expected improvement algorithm. Surprisingly, this simple change results in an algorithm that is asymptotically optimal for Gaussian best-arm identification problems, and provably outperforms standard EI by an order of magnitude.},

The classic problem involves allocating trials to the arms of a multiarmed slot machine to maximize the expected sum of rewards. We pose a new variation of the multiarmed bandit—the Max K-Armed Bandit—in which trials must be allocated among the arms to maximize the expected best single sample reward of the series of trials. Motivation for the Max K-Armed Bandit is the allocation of restarts among a set of multistart stochastic search algorithms. We present an analysis of this Max K-Armed Bandit showing under certain assumptions that the optimal strategy allocates trials to the observed best arm at a rate increasing double exponentially relative to the other arms. This motivates an exploration strategy that follows a Boltzmann distribution with an exponentially decaying temperature parameter. We compare this exploration policy to policies that allocate trials to the observed best arm at rates faster (and slower) than double exponentially. The results confirm, for two scheduling domains, that the double exponential increase in the rate of allocations to the observed best heuristic outperforms the other approaches.},

abstract = {A determinantal point process (DPP) is a probabilistic model of set diversity compactly parameterized by a positive semi-definite kernel matrix. To fit a DPP to a given task, we would like to learn the entries of its kernel matrix by maximizing the log-likelihood of the available data. However, log-likelihood is non-convex in the entries of the kernel matrix, and this learning problem is conjectured to be NP-hard. Thus, previous work has instead focused on more restricted convex learning settings: learning only a single weight for each row of the kernel matrix, or learning weights for a linear combination of DPPs with fixed kernel matrices. In this work we propose a novel algorithm for learning the full kernel matrix. By changing the kernel parameterization from matrix entries to eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and then lower-bounding the likelihood in the manner of expectation-maximization algorithms, we obtain an effective optimization procedure. We test our method on a real-world product recommendation task, and achieve relative gains of up to 16.5{\%} in test log-likelihood compared to the naive approach of maximizing likelihood by projected gradient ascent on the entries of the kernel matrix.},

In this work we present a new method for learning the DPP kernel from observed data using a low-rank factorization of this kernel. We show that this low-rank factorization enables a learning algorithm that is nearly an order of magnitude faster than previous approaches, while also providing for a method for computing product recommendation predictions that is far faster (up to 20x faster or more for large item catalogs) than previous techniques that involve a full-rank DPP kernel. Furthermore, we show that our method provides equivalent or sometimes better predictive performance than prior full-rank DPP approaches, and better performance than several other competing recommendation methods in many cases.

abstract = {Determinantal point processes (DPPs) are point process models that naturally encode diversity between the points of a given realization, through a positive definite kernel {\$}K{\$}. DPPs possess desirable properties, such as exact sampling or analyticity of the moments, but learning the parameters of kernel {\$}K{\$} through likelihood-based inference is not straightforward. First, the kernel that appears in the likelihood is not {\$}K{\$}, but another kernel {\$}L{\$} related to {\$}K{\$} through an often intractable spectral decomposition. This issue is typically bypassed in machine learning by directly parametrizing the kernel {\$}L{\$}, at the price of some interpretability of the model parameters. We follow this approach here. Second, the likelihood has an intractable normalizing constant, which takes the form of a large determinant in the case of a DPP over a finite set of objects, and the form of a Fredholm determinant in the case of a DPP over a continuous domain. Our main contribution is to derive bounds on the likelihood of a DPP, both for finite and continuous domains. Unlike previous work, our bounds are cheap to evaluate since they do not rely on approximating the spectrum of a large matrix or an operator. Through usual arguments, these bounds thus yield cheap variational inference and moderately expensive exact Markov chain Monte Carlo inference methods for DPPs.},

abstract = {Determinantal point processes (DPPs) have recently been proposed as computa-tionally efficient probabilistic models of diverse sets for a variety of applications, including document summarization, image search, and pose estimation. Many DPP inference operations, including normalization and sampling, are tractable; however, finding the most likely configuration (MAP), which is often required in practice for decoding, is NP-hard, so we must resort to approximate inference. This optimization problem, which also arises in experimental design and sensor placement, involves finding the largest principal minor of a positive semidefinite matrix. Because the objective is log-submodular, greedy algorithms have been used in the past with some empirical success; however, these methods only give approximation guarantees in the special case of monotone objectives, which cor-respond to a restricted class of DPPs. In this paper we propose a new algorithm for approximating the MAP problem based on continuous techniques for submod-ular function maximization. Our method involves a novel continuous relaxation of the log-probability function, which, in contrast to the multilinear extension used for general submodular functions, can be evaluated and differentiated exactly and efficiently. We obtain a practical algorithm with a 1/4-approximation guarantee for a more general class of non-monotone DPPs; our algorithm also extends to MAP inference under complex polytope constraints, making it possible to com-bine DPPs with Markov random fields, weighted matchings, and other models. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms standard and recent methods on both synthetic and real-world data.},

abstract = {Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) were introduced by Mac-chi [1] as a model for repulsive (fermionic) particle distributions. But their recent popularization is largely due to their usefulness for encouraging diversity in the final stage of a recommender system [2]. The standard sampling scheme for finite DPPs is a spectral decomposition followed by an equivalent of a randomly diagonally-pivoted Cholesky factorization of an orthogonal projection, which is only applicable to Hermitian kernels and has an expensive setup cost. Researchers have begun to connect DPP sampling to LDL H factoriza-tions as a means of avoiding the initial spectral decomposition, but existing approaches have only outperformed the spectral decomposition approach in special circumstances, where the number of kept modes is a small percentage of the ground set size. This article proves that trivial modifications of LU and LDL H fac-torizations yield efficient direct sampling schemes for non-Hermitian and Hermitian DPP kernels, respectively. Further, it is experimentally shown that even dynamically-scheduled, shared-memory paralleliza-tions of high-performance dense and sparse-direct factorizations can be trivially modified to yield DPP sampling schemes with essentially identical performance.

The gist of DPP is that the probability of choosing a particular set of items is proportional to the determinant of a positive definite matrix that de-fines the similarity of those items. However, computing the determinant requires time cubic in the number of items, and is hence impractical for large sets. In this paper, we address this problem by constructing a rapidly mixing Markov chain, from which we can acquire a sample from the given DPP in sub-cubic time. In ad-dition, we show that this framework can be extended to sampling from cardinality-constrained DPPs. As an application, we show how our sampling algorithm can be used to provide a fast heuristic for determining the number of clusters, resulting in better clustering.

Next, we introduce a Monte Carlo method based on these determinantal point processes, and prove a CLT with explicit limiting variance for the quadrature error, when the reference measure satisfies a stronger regularity condition. As a corollary, by taking a specific reference measure and using a construction similar to importance sampling, we obtain a general Monte Carlo method, which applies to any measure with continuously derivable density.

We show that this is possible if the subset of columns is chosen proportional to the squared volume spanned by the rows of the chosen submatrix (ie, volume sampling). The resulting estimator is unbiased and surprisingly the covariance of the estimator also has a closed form: It equals a specific factor times {\$}X{\^{}}+X{\^{}}{\{}+\backslashtop{\}}{\$}. Pseudo inverse plays an important part in solving the linear least squares problem, where we try to predict a label for each column of {\$}X{\$}. We assume labels are expensive and we are only given the labels for the small subset of columns we sample from {\$}X{\$}. Using our methods we show that the weight vector of the solution for the sub problem is an unbiased estimator of the optimal solution for the whole problem based on all column labels. We believe that these new formulas establish a fundamental connection between linear least squares and volume sampling. We use our methods to obtain an algorithm for volume sampling that is faster than state-of-the-art and for obtaining bounds for the total loss of the estimated least-squares solution on all labeled columns.},

We propose an acceleration algorithm to greatly speed up the process of the result inference, making our algorithm practical for large-scale scenarios. We also incorporate a tunable parameter into the DPP model which allows the users to smoothly control the level of diversity. More diversity metrics are introduced to better evaluate diversification algorithms.

abstract = {Consider a finite weighted oriented graph. We study a probability measure on the set of spanning rooted oriented forests on the graph. We prove that the set of roots sampled from this measure is a determinantal process, characterized by a possibly non-symmetric kernel with complex eigenvalues. We then derive several results relating this measure to the Markov process associated with the starting graph, to the spectrum of its generator and to hitting times of subsets of the graph. In particular, the mean hitting time of the set of roots turns out to be independent of the starting point, conditioning or not to a given number of roots. Wilson's algorithm provides a way to sample this measure and, in absence of complex eigenvalues of the generator, we explain how to get samples with a number of roots approximating a prescribed integer. We also exploit the properties of this measure to give some probabilistic insight into the proof of an algebraic result due to Micchelli and Willoughby [13]. Further, we present two different related coalescence and fragmentation processes.},

Divnet models neuronal diversity by placing a Determi-nantal Point Process (DPP) over neurons in a given layer. It uses this DPP to select a subset of diverse neurons and subsequently fuses the redundant neurons into the selected ones. Compared with previous approaches, Di-vnet offers a more principled, flexible technique for capturing neuronal diversity and thus implicitly enforcing regularization. This enables effec-tive auto-tuning of network architecture and leads to smaller network sizes without hurting performance. Moreover, through its focus on diversity and neuron fusing, Divnet remains compatible with other procedures that seek to reduce memory footprints of networks. We present experimental results to corroborate our claims: for pruning neural networks, Divnet is seen to be notably superior to competing approaches.},

abstract = {Video summarization is a challenging problem with great application potential. Whereas prior approaches, largely unsupervised in nature, focus on sampling use-ful frames and assembling them as summaries, we consider video summarization as a supervised subset selection problem. Our idea is to teach the system to learn from human-created summaries how to select informative and diverse subsets, so as to best meet evaluation metrics derived from human-perceived quality. To this end, we propose the sequential determinantal point process (seqDPP), a proba-bilistic model for diverse sequential subset selection. Our novel seqDPP heeds the inherent sequential structures in video data, thus overcoming the deficiency of the standard DPP, which treats video frames as randomly permutable items. Mean-while, seqDPP retains the power of modeling diverse subsets, essential for summa-rization. Our extensive results of summarizing videos from 3 datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method, compared to not only existing unsuper-vised methods but also naive applications of the standard DPP model.},

Determinantal processes arise in physics (fermions, eigenvalues of random matrices) and in combinatorics (nonintersecting paths, random spanning trees).

Moreover, any determinantal process can be represented as a mixture of determinantal projection processes. We give a simple explanation for these known facts, and establish analogous representations for permanental processes, with geometric variables replacing the Bernoulli variables.

Intuitive simple approaches have also been shown to perform unexpectedly well for the task. Yet it is practically impossible to compare the existing approaches directly, because systems have been evaluated on different datasets, with different evaluation measures, against different sets of comparison systems. Here we present a corpus of summaries produced by several state-of-the-art extractive summarization systems or by popular baseline systems. The inputs come from the 2004 DUC evaluation, the latest year in which generic summarization was addressed in a shared task. We use the same settings for ROUGE automatic evaluation to compare the systems directly and analyze the statistical significance of the differences in performance. We show that in terms of average scores the state-of-the-art systems appear similar but that in fact they produce very different summaries. Our corpus will facilitate future research on generic summarization and motivates the need for development of more sensitive evaluation measures and for approaches to system combination in summarization.},

Several applications that use DPPs rely on the fact that they are computationally tractable -- i.e., there are algorithms for sampling from DPPs efficiently. Recently, there is growing interest in studying a generalization of DPPs in which the support of the distribution is a restricted family B of subsets of {\$}\backslash{\{}1,2,\backslashldots, m\backslash{\}}{\$}. Mathematically, these distributions, which we call generalized DPPs, include the well-studied hardcore distributions as special cases (when {\$}L{\$} is diagonal). In applications, they can be used to refine models based on DPPs by imposing combinatorial constraints on the support of the distribution. In this paper we take first steps in a systematic study of computational questions concerning generalized DPPs. We introduce a natural class of linear families: roughly, a family B is said to be linear if there is a collection of {\$}p{\$} linear forms that all elements of B satisfy. Important special cases of linear families are all sets of cardinality {\$}k{\$} -- giving rise to {\$}k{\$}-DPPs -- and, more generally, partition matroids. On the positive side, we prove that, when {\$}p{\$} is a constant, there is an efficient, exact sampling algorithm for linear DPPs. We complement these results by proving that, when {\$}p{\$} is large, the computational problem related to such DPPs becomes {\$}\backslash{\#}{\$}P-hard. Our proof techniques rely and build on the interplay between polynomials and probability distributions.},

abstract = {Statistical models and methods for determinantal point processes (DPPs) seem largely unexplored. We demonstrate that DPPs provide useful models for the description of spatial point pattern datasets where nearby points repel each other. Such data are usually modelled by Gibbs point processes, where the likelihood and moment expressions are intractable and simulations are time consuming. We exploit the appealing probabilistic properties of DPPs to develop parametric models, where the likelihood and moment expressions can be easily evaluated and realizations can be quickly simulated. We discuss how statistical inference is conducted using the likelihood or moment properties of DPP models, and we provide freely available software for simulation and statistical inference.},

abstract = {Determinantal point processes (DPPs) have garnered attention as an elegant probabilistic model of set diversity. They are useful for a number of subset selection tasks, including product recommendation. DPPs are parametrized by a positive semi-definite kernel matrix. In this work we present a new method for learning the DPP kernel from observed data using a low-rank factorization of this kernel. We show that this low-rank factorization enables a learning algorithm that is nearly an order of magnitude faster than previous approaches, while also providing for a method for computing product recommendation predictions that is far faster (up to 20x faster or more for large item catalogs) than previous techniques that involve a full-rank DPP kernel. Furthermore, we show that our method provides equivalent or sometimes better predictive performance than prior full-rank DPP approaches, and better performance than several other competing recommendation methods in many cases. We conduct an extensive experimental evaluation using several real-world datasets in the domain of product recommendation to demonstrate the utility of our method, along with its limitations.},

Both KMEANSRAND and KMEANS++ have a major that the value of k needs to be set by the user of the algorithms. (Kang 2013) recently proposed a novel use of determinantal point processes for sampling the initial centroids for the KMEANS algorithm (we call it KMEANSD++). They, however, do not provide any evaluation establishing that KMEANSD++ is better than other algorithms. In this paper, we show that the performance of KMEANSD++ is comparable to KMEANS++ (both of which are better than KMEANSRAND) with KMEANSD++ having an additional that it can automatically approximate the value of k.},

abstract = {We show that repulsive random variables can yield Monte Carlo methods with faster convergence rates than the typical {\$}N{\^{}}{\{}-1/2{\}}{\$}, where {\$}N{\$} is the number of integrand evaluations. More precisely, we propose stochastic numerical quadratures involving determinantal point processes associated with multivariate orthogonal polynomials, and we obtain root mean square errors that decrease as {\$}N{\^{}}{\{}-(1+1/d)/2{\}}{\$}, where {\$}d{\$} is the dimension of the ambient space. First, we prove a central limit theorem (CLT) for the linear statistics of a class of determinantal point processes, when the reference measure is a product measure supported on a hypercube, which satisfies the Nevai-class regularity condition, a result which may be of independent interest. Next, we introduce a Monte Carlo method based on these determinantal point processes, and prove a CLT with explicit limiting variance for the quadrature error, when the reference measure satisfies a stronger regularity condition. As a corollary, by taking a specific reference measure and using a construction similar to importance sampling, we obtain a general Monte Carlo method, which applies to any measure with continuously derivable density. Loosely speaking, our method can be interpreted as a stochastic counterpart to Gaussian quadrature, which, at the price of some convergence rate, is easily generalizable to any dimension and has a more explicit error term.},

abstract = {Determinantal point processes (DPPs) are distributions over sets of items that model diversity using kernels. Their applications in machine learning include summary extraction and recommendation systems. Yet, the cost of sampling from a DPP is prohibitive in large-scale applications, which has triggered an effort towards efficient approximate samplers. We build a novel MCMC sampler that combines ideas from combinatorial geometry, linear programming, and Monte Carlo methods to sample from DPPs with a fixed sample cardinality, also called projection DPPs. Our sampler leverages the ability of the hit-and-run MCMC kernel to efficiently move across convex bodies. Previous theoretical results yield a fast mixing time of our chain when targeting a distribution that is close to a projection DPP, but not a DPP in general. Our empirical results demonstrate that this extends to sampling projection DPPs, i.e., our sampler is more sample-efficient than previous approaches which in turn translates to faster convergence when dealing with costly-to-evaluate functions, such as summary extraction in our experiments.},

We apply this new class to modelling text documents as sampling a DPP of sentences, and propose a conditional maximum likelihood formulation to model topic proportions, which is made possible with no approximation for our class of DPPs.

A submodular shell is an abstract submodular function that can be instantiated with a ground set and a set of parameters to produce a submodular function. A mixture of such shells can then also be so instantiated to produce a more complex submodular function. What our algorithm learns are the mixture weights over such shells. We provide a risk bound guarantee when learning in a large-margin structured-prediction setting using a projected subgradient method when only approximate submodular optimization is possible (such as with submodular function maximization). We apply this method to the problem of multi-document summarization and produce the best results reported so far on the widely used NIST DUC-05 through DUC-07 document summarization corpora.},

abstract = {Subset selection problems ask for a small, diverse yet representative subset of the given data. When pairwise similarities are captured by a kernel, the determinants of submatrices provide a measure of diversity or independence of items within a subset. Matroid theory gives another notion of independence, thus giving rise to optimization and sampling questions about Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) under matroid constraints. Partition constraints, as a special case, arise naturally when incorporating additional labeling or clustering information, besides the kernel, in DPPs. Finding the maximum determinant submatrix under matroid constraints on its row/column indices has been previously studied. However, the corresponding question of sampling from DPPs under matroid constraints has been unresolved, beyond the simple cardinality constrained k-DPPs. We give the first polynomial time algorithm to sample exactly from DPPs under partition constraints, for any constant number of partitions. We complement this by a complexity theoretic barrier that rules out such a result under general matroid constraints. Our experiments indicate that partition-constrained DPPs offer more flexibility and more diversity than k-DPPs and their naive extensions, while being reasonably efficient in running time. We also show that a simple greedy initialization followed by local search gives improved approximation guarantees for the problem of MAP inference from k- DPPs on well-conditioned kernels. Our experiments show that this improvement is significant for larger values of k, supporting our theoretical result.},

@article{KaDeKo16,
abstract = {Gaussian Process bandit optimization has emerged as a powerful tool for optimizing noisy black box functions. One example in machine learning is hyper-parameter optimization where each evaluation of the target function requires training a model which may involve days or even weeks of computation. Most methods for this so-called "Bayesian optimization" only allow sequential exploration of the parameter space. However, it is often desirable to propose batches or sets of parameter values to explore simultaneously, especially when there are large parallel processing facilities at our disposal. Batch methods require modeling the interaction between the different evaluations in the batch, which can be expensive in complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose a new approach for parallelizing Bayesian optimization by modeling the diversity of a batch via Determinantal point processes (DPPs) whose kernels are learned automatically. This allows us to generalize a previous result as well as prove better regret bounds based on DPP sampling. Our experiments on a variety of synthetic and real-world robotics and hyper-parameter optimization tasks indicate that our DPP-based methods, especially those based on DPP sampling, outperform state-of-the-art methods.},
