Neural operators, serving as physics surrogate models, have recently gained
increased interest. With ever increasing problem complexity, the natural
question arises: what is an efficient way to scale neural operators to larger
and more complex simulations - most importantly by taking into account
different types of simulation datasets. This is of special interest since, akin
to their numerical counterparts, different techniques are used across
applications, even if the underlying dynamics of the systems are similar.
Whereas the flexibility of transformers has enabled unified architectures
across domains, neural operators mostly follow a problem specific design, where
GNNs are commonly used for Lagrangian simulations and grid-based models
predominate Eulerian simulations. We introduce Universal Physics Transformers
(UPTs), an efficient and unified learning paradigm for a wide range of
spatio-temporal problems. UPTs operate without grid- or particle-based latent
structures, enabling flexibility and scalability across meshes and particles.
UPTs efficiently propagate dynamics in the latent space, emphasized by inverse
encoding and decoding techniques. Finally, UPTs allow for queries of the latent
space representation at any point in space-time. We demonstrate diverse
applicability and efficacy of UPTs in mesh-based fluid simulations, and
steady-state Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes simulations, and Lagrangian-based
dynamics.
