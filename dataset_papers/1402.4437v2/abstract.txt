We present a new probabilistic model of compact commutative Lie groups that
produces invariant-equivariant and disentangled representations of data. To
define the notion of disentangling, we borrow a fundamental principle from
physics that is used to derive the elementary particles of a system from its
symmetries. Our model employs a newfound Bayesian conjugacy relation that
enables fully tractable probabilistic inference over compact commutative Lie
groups -- a class that includes the groups that describe the rotation and
cyclic translation of images. We train the model on pairs of transformed image
patches, and show that the learned invariant representation is highly effective
for classification.
