Unexpectedly wide variations between these sums, however, have been noted in survey responses to hypothetical options. This paper reports the results of a series of experiments that confronted people with actual money payments and cash compensations. The results indicate that the compensation measure of value seems to exceed significantly the willingness to pay measure, which would appear to call into some question various rules of entitlement, damage assessments, and interpretations of indifference curves.},

abstract ={Hit songs, books, and movies are many times more successful than average, suggesting that “the best” alternatives are qualitatively different from “the rest”; yet experts routinely fail to predict which products will succeed. We investigated this paradox experimentally, by creating an artificial “music market” in which 14,341 participants downloaded previously unknown songs either with or without knowledge of previous participants' choices. Increasing the strength of social influence increased both inequality and unpredictability of success. Success was also only partly determined by quality: The best songs rarely did poorly, and the worst rarely did well, but any other result was possible.},

However, decades of research on diversity in offline work groups have painted an inconclusive picture. On the one hand, the broader range of insights from a diverse group can lead to improved outcomes. On the other hand, individual differences can lead to conflict and diminished performance. In this paper, we examine the effects of group diversity on the amount of work accomplished and on member withdrawal behaviors in the context of WikiProjects. We find that increased diversity in experience with Wikipedia increases group productivity and decreases member withdrawal -- up to a point. Beyond that point, group productivity remains high, but members are more likely to withdraw. Strikingly, no such diminishing returns were observed for differences in member interest, which increases productivity and decreases member withdrawal in a linear fashion. Our results suggest that the low visibility of individual differences in online groups may allow them to harvest more of the benefits of diversity while bearing less of the cost. We discuss how our findings can inform further research of online collaboration.</p>},

     abstract = {Aside from possible income effects, measures of the maximum amounts people will pay to avoid a loss and the minimum compensation necessary for them to accept it are generally assumed to be equivalent. Unexpectedly wide variations between these sums, however, have been noted in survey responses to hypothetical options. This paper reports the results of a series of experiments that confronted people with actual money payments and cash compensations. The results indicate that the compensation measure of value seems to exceed significantly the willingness to pay measure, which would appear to call into some question various rules of entitlement, damage assessments, and interpretations of indifference curves.},

    title = "Soft similarity and soft cosine measure: Similarity of features in vector space model",
    abstract = "We show how to consider similarity between features for calculation of similarity of objects in the Vector Space Model (VSM) for machine learning algorithms and other classes of methods that involve similarity between objects. Unlike LSA, we assume that similarity between features is known (say, from a synonym dictionary) and does not need to be learned from the data. We call the proposed similarity measure soft similarity. Similarity between features is common, for example, in natural language processing: words, n-grams, or syntactic n-grams can be somewhat different (which makes them different features) but still have much in common: for example, words {"}play{"} and {"}game{"} are different but related. When there is no similarity between features then our soft similarity measure is equal to the standard similarity. For this, we generalize the well-known cosine similarity measure in VSM by introducing what we call {"}soft cosine measure{"}. We propose various formulas for exact or approximate calculation of the soft cosine measure. For example, in one of them we consider for VSM a new feature space consisting of pairs of the original features weighted by their similarity. Again, for features that bear no similarity to each other, our formulas reduce to the standard cosine measure. Our experiments show that our soft cosine measure provides better performance in our case study: entrance exams question answering task at CLEF. In these experiments, we use syntactic n-grams as features and Levenshtein distance as the similarity between n-grams, measured either in characters or in elements of n-grams.",

DBpedia allows you to ask sophisticated queries against datasets derived from Wikipedia and to link other datasets on the Web to Wikipedia data. We describe the extraction of the DBpedia datasets, and how the resulting information is published on the Web for human- and machine-consumption. We describe some emerging applications from the DBpedia community and show how website authors can facilitate DBpedia content within their sites. Finally, we present the current status of interlinking DBpedia with other open datasets on the Web and outline how DBpedia could serve as a nucleus for an emerging Web of open data.",
