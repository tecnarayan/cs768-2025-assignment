This paper is concerned with the sample efficiency of reinforcement learning,
assuming access to a generative model (or simulator). We first consider
$\gamma$-discounted infinite-horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs) with
state space $\mathcal{S}$ and action space $\mathcal{A}$. Despite a number of
prior works tackling this problem, a complete picture of the trade-offs between
sample complexity and statistical accuracy is yet to be determined. In
particular, all prior results suffer from a severe sample size barrier, in the
sense that their claimed statistical guarantees hold only when the sample size
exceeds at least $\frac{|\mathcal{S}||\mathcal{A}|}{(1-\gamma)^2}$. The current
paper overcomes this barrier by certifying the minimax optimality of two
algorithms -- a perturbed model-based algorithm and a conservative model-based
algorithm -- as soon as the sample size exceeds the order of
$\frac{|\mathcal{S}||\mathcal{A}|}{1-\gamma}$ (modulo some log factor). Moving
beyond infinite-horizon MDPs, we further study time-inhomogeneous
finite-horizon MDPs, and prove that a plain model-based planning algorithm
suffices to achieve minimax-optimal sample complexity given any target accuracy
level. To the best of our knowledge, this work delivers the first
minimax-optimal guarantees that accommodate the entire range of sample sizes
(beyond which finding a meaningful policy is information theoretically
infeasible).
