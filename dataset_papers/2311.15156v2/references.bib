abstract={Researchers view vast zeros in single-cell RNA-seq data differently: some regard zeros as biological signals representing no or low gene expression, while others regard zeros as missing data to be corrected. To help address the controversy, here we discuss the sources of biological and non-biological zeros; introduce five mechanisms of adding non-biological zeros in computational benchmarking; evaluate the impacts of non-biological zeros on data analysis; benchmark three input data types: observed counts, imputed counts, and binarized counts; discuss the open questions regarding non-biological zeros; and advocate the importance of transparent analysis.},

abstract={The scale and capabilities of single-cell RNA-sequencing methods have expanded rapidly in recent years, enabling major discoveries and large-scale cell mapping efforts. However, these methods have not been systematically and comprehensively benchmarked. Here, we directly compare seven methods for single-cell and/or single-nucleus profiling---selecting representative methods based on their usage and our expertise and resources to prepare libraries---including two low-throughput and five high-throughput methods. We tested the methods on three types of samples: cell lines, peripheral blood mononuclear cells and brain tissue, generating 36 libraries in six separate experiments in a single center. To directly compare the methods and avoid processing differences introduced by the existing pipelines, we developed scumi, a flexible computational pipeline that can be used with any single-cell RNA-sequencing method. We evaluated the methods for both basic performance, such as the structure and alignment of reads, sensitivity and extent of multiplets, and for their ability to recover known biological information in the samples.},

abstract = {Despite their crucial role in health and disease, our knowledge of immune cells within human tissues remains limited. We surveyed the immune compartment of 16 tissues from 12 adult donors by single-cell RNA sequencing and VDJ sequencing generating a dataset of ~360,000 cells. To systematically resolve immune cell heterogeneity across tissues, we developed CellTypist, a machine learning tool for rapid and precise cell type annotation. Using this approach, combined with detailed curation, we determined the tissue distribution of finely phenotyped immune cell types, revealing hitherto unappreciated tissue-specific features and clonal architecture of T and B cells. Our multitissue approach lays the foundation for identifying highly resolved immune cell types by leveraging a common reference dataset, tissue-integrated expression analysis, and antigen receptor sequencing. The human immune system is composed of many different cell types spread across the entire body, but little is currently known about the fine-grained variations in these cell types across organs. Using single-cell genomics, Domínguez Conde et al. examined the gene expression profile of more than 300,000 individual immune cells extracted from 16 different tissues in 12 deceased adult organ donors (see the Perspective by Liu and Zhang). Cell identity was assigned using CellTypist, an automated cell classification tool designed by the authors. In-depth data analysis revealed insights into how the immune system adapts to function effectively in different organ contexts. —LZ and DJ An immune cell atlas of human innate and adaptive immune cells across lymphoid, mucosal, and exocrine sites reveals tissue-specific compositions and features.}}

              However, their transcriptional characterization is still
              incomplete. Here, we sequenced the transcriptomes of thousands of
              human islet cells from healthy and type 2 diabetic donors. We

              $\gamma$, $\epsilon$, and stellate cells, and revealed
              subpopulations of $\alpha$, $\beta$, and acinar cells.
              Intriguingly, $\delta$ cells expressed several important
              receptors, indicating an unrecognized importance of these cells
              in integrating paracrine and systemic metabolic signals. Genes
              previously associated with obesity or diabetes were found to
              correlate with BMI. Finally, comparing healthy and T2D
