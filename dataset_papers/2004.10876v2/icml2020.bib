abstract="This chapter introduces the field of intrinsically motivated learning systems and illustrates the content, objectives, and organisation of the book. The chapter first expands the concept of intrinsic motivations, then introduces a taxonomy of three classes of intrinsic-motivation mechanisms (based on predictors, on novelty detection, and on competence), and finally introduces and reviews the various contributions of the book. The contributions are organised in six parts. The contributions of the first part provide general overviews on the concept of intrinsic motivations, the possible mechanisms that may implement them, and the functions that they can play. The contributions of the second, third, and fourth part focus on the three classes of the aforementioned intrinsic-motivation mechanisms. The contributions of the fifth part discuss mechanisms that are complementary to intrinsic motivations. The contributions of the sixth part introduce tools and experimental paradigms that can be used to investigate intrinsic motivations.",

  abstract = 	 {We propose Scheduled Auxiliary Control (SAC-X), a new learning paradigm in the context of Reinforcement Learning (RL). SAC-X enables learning of complex behaviors - from scratch - in the presence of multiple sparse reward signals. To this end, the agent is equipped with a set of general auxiliary tasks, that it attempts to learn simultaneously via off-policy RL. The key idea behind our method is that active (learned) scheduling and execution of auxiliary policies allows the agent to efficiently explore its environment - enabling it to excel at sparse reward RL. Our experiments in several challenging robotic manipulation settings demonstrate the power of our approach.}

    abstract = "{Industrial robots are mechanical manipulators whose dynamic characteristics are highly nonlinear. To control a manipulator which carries a variable or unknown load and moves along a planned path, it is required to compute the forces and torques needed to drive all its joints accurately and frequently at an adequate sampling frequency (no less than 60 Hz for the arm considered). This paper presents a new approach of computation based on the method of Newton-Euler formulation which is independent of the type of manipulator-configuration. This method involves the successive transformation of velocities and accelerations from the base of the manipulator out to the gripper, link by link, using the relationships of moving coordinate systems. Forces are then transformed back from the gripper to the base to obtain the joint torques. Theoretically the mathematical model is “exact”. A program has been written in floating point assembly language which has an average execution time of 4.5 milliseconds on a PDP 11/45 computer for a Stanford manipulator. This allows an on-line computation within control systems with a sampling frequency no lower than 60 Hz. A further advantage of using this method is that the amount of computation increases linearly with the number of links whereas the conventional method based on Lagrangian formulation increases as the quartic of the number of links.}",

title = "Combined task and motion planning through an extensible planner-independent interface layer",
abstract = "The need for combined task and motion planning in robotics is well understood. Solutions to this problem have typically relied on special purpose, integrated implementations of task planning and motion planning algorithms. We propose a new approach that uses off-the-shelf task planners and motion planners and makes no assumptions about their implementation. Doing so enables our approach to directly build on, and benefit from, the vast literature and latest advances in task planning and motion planning. It uses a novel representational abstraction and requires only that failures in computing a motion plan for a high-level action be identifiable and expressible in the form of logical predicates at the task level. We evaluate the approach and illustrate its robustness through a number of experiments using a state-of-the-art robotics simulator and a PR2 robot. These experiments show the system accomplishing a diverse set of challenging tasks such as taking advantage of a tray when laying out a table for dinner and picking objects from cluttered environments where other objects need to be re-arranged before the target object can be reached.",

Nevertheless, such tools typically require a large amount of training data and significant manual effort for labeling objects. This limits their applicability in robotics, where it is necessary to scale solutions to a large number of objects and a variety of conditions. The present work proposes a fully autonomous process to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs) for object detection and pose estimation in robotic setups. The application involves detection of objects placed in a clutter and in tight environments, such as a shelf. In particular, given access to 3D object models, several aspects of the environment are simulated and the models are placed in physically realistic poses with respect to their environment to generate a labeled synthetic dataset. To further improve object detection, the network self-trains over real images that are labeled using a robust multi-view pose estimation process. The proposed training process is evaluated on several existing datasets and on a dataset that we collected with a Motoman robotic manipulator. Results show that the proposed process outperforms popular training processes relying on synthetic data generation and manual annotation.},

    abstract = { In this paper, we propose a learning algorithm that speeds up the search in task and motion planning problems. Our algorithm proposes solutions to three different challenges that arise in learning to improve planning efficiency: what to predict, how to represent a planning problem instance, and how to transfer knowledge from one problem instance to another. We propose a method that predicts constraints on the search space based on a generic representation of a planning problem instance, called score-space, where we represent a problem instance in terms of the performance of a set of solutions attempted so far. Using this representation, we transfer knowledge, in the form of constraints, from previous problems based on the similarity in score-space. We design a sequential algorithm that efficiently predicts these constraints, and evaluate it in three different challenging task and motion planning problems. Results indicate that our approach performs orders of magnitudes faster than an unguided planner. }

@inproceedings{learnedheuristics,
title = "Guided search for task and motion plans using learned heuristics",
abstract = "Tasks in mobile manipulation planning often require thousands of individual motions to complete. Such tasks require reasoning about complex goals as well as the feasibility of movements in configuration space. In discrete representations, planning complexity is exponential in the length of the plan. In mobile manipulation, parameters for an action often draw from a continuous space, so we must also cope with an infinite branching factor. Task and motion planning (TAMP) methods integrate logical search over high-level actions with geometric reasoning to address this challenge. We present an algorithm that searches the space of possible task and motion plans and uses statistical machine learning to guide the search process. Our contributions are as follows: 1) we present a complete algorithm for TAMP; 2) we present a randomized local search algorithm for plan refinement that is easily formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP); 3) we apply reinforcement learning (RL) to learn a policy for this MDP; 4) we learn from expert demonstrations to efficiently search the space of high-level task plans, given options that address different (potential) infeasibilities; and 5) we run experiments to evaluate our system in a variety of simulated domains. We show significant improvements in performance over prior work.",

    abstract = { Robots with many degrees of freedom (e.g., humanoid robots and mobile manipulators) have increasingly been employed to accomplish realistic tasks in domains such as disaster relief, spacecraft logistics, and home caretaking. Finding feasible motions for these robots autonomously is essential for their operation. Sampling-based motion planning algorithms are effective for these high-dimensional systems; however, incorporating task constraints (e.g., keeping a cup level or writing on a board) into the planning process introduces significant challenges. This survey describes the families of methods for sampling-based planning with constraints and places them on a spectrum delineated by their complexity. Constrained sampling-based methods are based on two core primitive operations: (a) sampling constraint-satisfying configurations and (b) generating constraint-satisfying continuous motion. Although this article presents the basics of sampling-based planning for contextual background, it focuses on the representation of constraints and sampling-based planners that incorporate constraints. }
