Computable Stein discrepancies have been deployed for a variety of
applications, ranging from sampler selection in posterior inference to
approximate Bayesian inference to goodness-of-fit testing. Existing
convergence-determining Stein discrepancies admit strong theoretical guarantees
but suffer from a computational cost that grows quadratically in the sample
size. While linear-time Stein discrepancies have been proposed for
goodness-of-fit testing, they exhibit avoidable degradations in testing power
-- even when power is explicitly optimized. To address these shortcomings, we
introduce feature Stein discrepancies ($\Phi$SDs), a new family of quality
measures that can be cheaply approximated using importance sampling. We show
how to construct $\Phi$SDs that provably determine the convergence of a sample
to its target and develop high-accuracy approximations -- random $\Phi$SDs
(R$\Phi$SDs) -- which are computable in near-linear time. In our experiments
with sampler selection for approximate posterior inference and goodness-of-fit
testing, R$\Phi$SDs perform as well or better than quadratic-time KSDs while
being orders of magnitude faster to compute.
