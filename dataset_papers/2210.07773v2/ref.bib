abstract = {We study a partial-information online-learning problem where actions are restricted to noisy comparisons between pairs of strategies (also known as bandits). In contrast to conventional approaches that require the absolute reward of the chosen strategy to be quantifiable and observable, our setting assumes only that (noisy) binary feedback about the relative reward of two chosen strategies is available. This type of relative feedback is particularly appropriate in applications where absolute rewards have no natural scale or are difficult to measure (e.g., user-perceived quality of a set of retrieval results, taste of food, product attractiveness), but where pairwise comparisons are easy to make. We propose a novel regret formulation in this setting, as well as present an algorithm that achieves information-theoretically optimal regret bounds (up to a constant factor).}

abstract = {Collaborative filtering is a popular technique to infer users' preferences on new content based on the collective information of all users preferences. Recommender systems then use this information to make personalized suggestions to users. When users accept these recommendations it creates a feedback loop in the recommender system, and these loops iteratively influence the collaborative filtering algorithm's predictions over time. We investigate whether it is possible to identify items affected by these feedback loops. We state sufficient assumptions to deconvolve the feedback loops while keeping the inverse solution tractable. We furthermore develop a metric to unravel the recommender system's influence on the entire user-item rating matrix. We use this metric on synthetic and real-world datasets to (1) identify the extent to which the recommender system affects the final rating matrix, (2) rank frequently recommended items, and (3) distinguish whether a user's rated item was recommended or an intrinsic preference. Our results indicate that it is possible to recover the ratings matrix of intrinsic user preferences using a single snapshot of the ratings matrix without any temporal information.},

    abstract = { The convex body chasing problem, introduced by Friedman and Linial [FL93], is a competitive analysis problem on any normed vector space. In convex body chasing, for each timestep t ϵ ℕ, a convex body Kt ⊆ ℝd is given as a request, and the player picks a point xt ϵ Kt. The player aims to ensure that the total distance moved is within a bounded ratio of the smallest possible offline solution. In this work, we consider the nested version of the problem, in which the sequence (Kt) must be decreasing. For Euclidean spaces, we consider a memoryless algorithm which moves to the so-called Steiner point, and show that in an appropriate sense it is exactly optimal among memoryless algorithms. For general finite dimensional normed spaces, we combine the Steiner point and our recent algorithm in [ABC+19] to obtain a new algorithm which is nearly optimal for all spaces with p ≥ 1, closing a polynomial gap. }

  abstract = 	 {We study the value of switching actions in the Prediction From Experts (PFE) problem and Adversarial Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB) problem. First, we revisit the well-studied and practically motivated setting of PFE with switching costs. Many algorithms are known to achieve the minimax optimal order of $O(\sqrt{T \log n})$ in \textit{expectation} for both regret and number of switches, where $T$ is the number of iterations and $n$ the number of actions. However, no \textit{high probability} guarantees are known. Our main technical contribution is the first algorithms which with high probability achieve this optimal order for both regret and number of switches. This settles an open problem of [Devroye et al., 2015], directly implies the first high probability guarantees for several problems of interest, and is efficiently adaptable to the related problem of online combinatorial optimization with limited switching. \par Next, to investigate the value of switching actions at a more granular level, we introduce the setting of \textit{switching budgets}, in which the algorithm is limited to $S \leq T$ switches between actions. This entails a limited number of free switches, in contrast to the unlimited number of expensive switches allowed in the switching cost setting. Using the above result and several reductions, we unify previous work and completely characterize the complexity of this switching budget setting up to small polylogarithmic factors: for both the PFE and MAB problems, for all switching budgets $S \leq T$, and for both expectation and high probability guarantees. For PFE, we show that the optimal rate is of order $\tilde{\Theta}(\sqrt{T\log n})$ for $S = \Omega(\sqrt{T\log n})$, and $\min(\tilde{\Theta}(\tfrac{T\log n}{S}), T)$ for $S = O(\sqrt{T \log n})$. Interestingly, the bandit setting does not exhibit such a phase transition; instead we show the minimax rate decays steadily as $\min(\tilde{\Theta}(\tfrac{T\sqrt{n}}{\sqrt{S}}), T)$ for all ranges of $S \leq T$. These results recover and generalize the known minimax rates for the (arbitrary) switching cost setting.}

abstract = { To mitigate the rabbit hole effect in recommendations, conventional distribution-aware recommendation systems aim to ensure that a user’s prior interest areas are reflected in the recommendations that the system makes. For example, a user who historically prefers comedies to dramas by 2:1 should see a similar ratio in recommended movies. Such approaches have proven to be an important building block for recommendation tasks. However, existing distribution-aware approaches enforce that the target taste distribution should exactly match a user’s prior interests (typically revealed through training data), based on the assumption that users’ taste distribution is fundamentally static. This assumption can lead to large estimation errors. We empirically identify this taste distortion problem through a data-driven study over multiple datasets. We show how taste preferences dynamically shift and how the design of a calibration mechanism should be designed with these shifts in mind. We further demonstrate how to incorporate these shifts into a taste enhanced calibrated recommender system, which results in simultaneously mitigated both the rabbit hole effect and taste distortion problem.},

abstract = {The prevalence of misinformation on online social media has tangible empirical connections to increasing political polarization and partisan antipathy in the United States. Ranking algorithms for social recommendation often encode broad assumptions about network structure (like homophily) and group cognition (like, social action is largely imitative). Assumptions like these can be na\"{\i}ve and exclusionary in the era of fake news and ideological uniformity towards the political poles. We examine these assumptions with aid from the user-centric framework of trustworthiness in social recommendation. The constituent dimensions of trustworthiness (diversity, transparency, explainability, disruption) highlight new opportunities for discouraging dogmatization and building decision-aware, transparent news recommender systems.},
