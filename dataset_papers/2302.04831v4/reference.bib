abstract = {The intuitive background for measures of structural centrality in social networks is reviewed and existing measures are evaluated in terms of their consistency with intuitions and their interpretability. Three distinct intuitive conceptions of centrality are uncovered and existing measures are refined to embody these conceptions. Three measures are developed for each concept, one absolute and one relative measure of the centrality of positions in a network, and one reflecting the degree of centralization of the entire network. The implications of these measures for the experimental study of small groups is examined.}

        booktitle="Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth Conference on Artificial Intelligence",
        month="July",year="2010", 
        abstract="
	          As autonomous agents proliferate in the real world,
	          both in software and robotic settings, they will
	          increasingly need to band together for cooperative
	          activities with previously unfamiliar teammates. In
	          such \emph{ad hoc team} settings, team strategies
	          cannot be developed a priori.  Rather, an agent must
	          be prepared to cooperate with many types of
	          teammates: it must collaborate without
	          pre-coordination.  This paper challenges the AI
	          community to develop theory and to implement
	          prototypes of ad hoc team agents.  It defines the
	          concept of ad hoc team agents, specifies an
	          evaluation paradigm, and provides examples of
	          possible theoretical and empirical approaches to
	          challenge.  The goal is to encourage progress
	          towards this ambitious, newly realistic, and
	          increasingly important research goal.",

abstract = {We investigate methods for planning in a Markov Decision Process where the cost function
is chosen by an adversary after we fix our policy. As a running example, we consider
a robot path planning problem where costs are influenced by sensors that an adversary
places in the environment. We formulate the problem as a zero-sum matrix game where
rows correspond to deterministic policies for the planning player and columns correspond
to cost vectors the adversary can select. For a fixed cost vector, fast algorithms
(such as value iteration) are available for solving MDPs. We develop efficient algorithms
for matrix games where such best response oracles exist. We show that for our path
planning problem these algorithms are at least an order of magnitude faster than direct
solution of the linear programming formulation.},
