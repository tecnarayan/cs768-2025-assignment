  abstract   = {{Accurate taxonomy is central to the study of biological
               diversity, as it provides the needed evolutionary framework
               for taxon sampling and interpreting results. While the number
               of recognized species in the class Mammalia has increased
               through time, tabulation of those increases has relied on the
               sporadic release of revisionary compendia like the Mammal
               Species of the World (MSW) series. Here, we present the Mammal
               Diversity Database (MDD), a digital, publically accessible,
               and updateable list of all mammalian species, now available
               online: https://mammaldiversity.org. The MDD will continue to
               be updated as manuscripts describing new species and higher
               taxonomic changes are released. Starting from the baseline of
               the 3rd edition of MSW (MSW3), we performed a review of
               taxonomic changes published since 2004 and digitally linked
               species names to their original descriptions and subsequent
               revisionary articles in an interactive, hierarchical database.
               We found 6,495 species of currently recognized mammals (96
               recently extinct, 6,399 extant), compared to 5,416 in MSW3 (75
               extinct, 5,341 extant)---an increase of 1,079 species in about
               13 years, including 11 species newly described as having gone
               extinct in the last 500 years. We tabulate 1,251 new species
               recognitions, at least 172 unions, and multiple major,
               higher-level changes, including an additional 88 genera (1,314
               now, compared to 1,226 in MSW3) and 14 newly recognized
               families (167 compared to 153). Analyses of the description of
               new species through time and across biogeographic regions show
               a long-term global rate of ~25 species recognized per year,
               with the Neotropics as the overall most species-dense
               biogeographic region for mammals, followed closely by the
               Afrotropics. The MDD provides the mammalogical community with
               an updateable online database of taxonomic changes, joining
               digital efforts already established for amphibians
               (AmphibiaWeb, AMNH's Amphibian Species of the World), birds
               (e.g., Avibase, IOC World Bird List, HBW Alive), non-avian
               reptiles (The Reptile Database), and fish (e.g., FishBase,
               Catalog of Fishes).Una taxonom{\'\i}a que precisamente refleje
               la realidad biol{\'o}gica es fundamental para el estudio de la
               diversidad de la vida, ya que proporciona el armaz{\'o}n
               evolutivo necesario para el muestreo de taxones e
               interpretaci{\'o}n de resultados del mismo. Si bien el
               n{\'u}mero de especies reconocidas en la clase Mammalia ha
               aumentado con el tiempo, la tabulaci{\'o}n de esos aumentos se
               ha basado en las espor{\'a}dicas publicaciones de compendios
               de revisiones taxon{\'o}micas, tales como la serie Especies de
               mam{\'\i}feros del mundo (MSW por sus siglas en ingl{\'e}s).
               En este trabajo presentamos la Base de Datos de Diversidad de
               Mam{\'\i}feros (MDD por sus siglas en ingl{\'e}s): una lista
               digital de todas las especies de mam{\'\i}feros, actualizable
               y accesible p{\'u}blicamente, disponible en la direcci{\'o}n
               URL https://mammaldiversity.org/. El MDD se actualizar{\'a}
               con regularidad a medida que se publiquen art{\'\i}culos que
               describan nuevas especies o que introduzcan cambios de
               diferentes categor{\'\i}as taxon{\'o}micas. Con la tercera
               edici{\'o}n de MSW (MSW3) como punto de partida, realizamos
               una revisi{\'o}n en profundidad de los cambios taxon{\'o}micos
               publicados a partir del 2004. Los nombres de las especies
               nuevamente descriptas (o ascendidas a partir de subespecies)
               fueron conectadas digitalmente en una base de datos
               interactiva y jer{\'a}rquica con sus descripciones originales
               y con art{\'\i}culos de revisi{\'o}n posteriores. Los datos
               indican que existen actualmente 6,495 especies de
               mam{\'\i}feros (96 extintas, 6,399 vivientes), en
               comparaci{\'o}n con las 5,416 reconocidas en MSW3 (75
               extintas, 5,341 vivientes): un aumento de 1,079 especies en
               aproximadamente 13 a{\~n}os, incluyendo 11 nuevas especies
               consideradas extintas en los {\'u}ltimos 500 a{\~n}os.
               Se{\~n}alamos 1,251 nuevos reconocimientos de especies, al
               menos 172 uniones y varios cambios a mayor nivel
               taxon{\'o}mico, incluyendo 88 g{\'e}neros adicionales (1,314
               reconocidos, comparados con 1,226 en MSW3) y 14 familias
               reci{\'e}n reconocidas (167 en comparaci{\'o}n con 153 en
               MSW3). Los an{\'a}lisis t{\'e}mporo-geogr{\'a}ficos de
               descripciones de nuevas especies (en las principales regiones
               del mundo) sugieren un promedio mundial de descripciones a
               largo plazo de aproximadamente 25 especies reconocidas por
               a{\~n}o, siendo el Neotr{\'o}pico la regi{\'o}n con mayor
               densidad de especies de mam{\'\i}feros en el mundo, seguida de
               cerca por la region Afrotr{\'o}pical. El MDD proporciona a la
               comunidad de mastozo{\'o}logos una base de datos de cambios
               taxon{\'o}micos conectada y actualizable, que se suma a los

               (AmphibiaWeb, Amphibian Species of the World), aves (p. ej.,

@Article{mora11how-many,
  abstract   = {Author Summary Knowing the number of species on Earth is one
               of the most basic yet elusive questions in science.
               Unfortunately, obtaining an accurate number is constrained by
               the fact that most species remain to be described and because
               indirect attempts to answer this question have been highly
               controversial. Here, we document that the taxonomic
               classification of species into higher taxonomic groups (from
               genera to phyla) follows a consistent pattern from which the
               total number of species in any taxonomic group can be
               predicted. Assessment of this pattern for all kingdoms of life
               on Earth predicts ∼8.7 million ($\pm$1.3 million SE) species
               globally, of which ∼2.2 million ($\pm$0.18 million SE) are
               marine. Our results suggest that some 86% of the species on
               Earth, and 91% in the ocean, still await description. Closing
               this knowledge gap will require a renewed interest in
               exploration and taxonomy, and a continuing effort to catalogue
               existing biodiversity data in publicly available databases.},

  abstract   = {We present a simple and efficient method for refining maps or
               correspondences by iterative upsampling in the spectral domain
               that can be implemented in a few lines of code. Our main
               observation is that high quality maps can be obtained even if
               the input correspondences are noisy or are encoded by a small
               number of coefficients in a spectral basis. We show how this
               approach can be used in conjunction with existing
               initialization techniques across a range of application
               scenarios, including symmetry detection, map refinement across
               complete shapes, non-rigid partial shape matching and function
               transfer. In each application we demonstrate an improvement
               with respect to both the quality of the results and the
               computational speed compared to the best competing methods,
               with up to two orders of magnitude speed-up in some
               applications. We also demonstrate that our method is both
               robust to noisy input and is scalable with respect to shape
               complexity. Finally, we present a theoretical justification
               for our approach, shedding light on structural properties of
               functional maps.},

               concepts in richer ways than conventional
               algorithms{\textemdash}for action, imagination, and
               explanation. We present a computational model that captures
               these human learning abilities for a large class of simple
               visual concepts: handwritten characters from the
               world{\textquoteright}s alphabets. The model represents
               concepts as simple programs that best explain observed
               examples under a Bayesian criterion. On a challenging one-shot
               classification task, the model achieves human-level
               performance while outperforming recent deep learning
               approaches. We also present several {\textquotedblleft}visual
               Turing tests{\textquotedblright} probing the
               model{\textquoteright}s creative generalization abilities,
               which in many cases are indistinguishable from human behavior.},

@InProceedings{bengio12deep,
  abstract   = {Deep learning algorithms seek to exploit the unknown
               structure in the input distribution in order to discover good
               representations, often at multiple levels, with higher-level
               learned features defined in terms of lower-level features. The
               objective is to make these higher-level representations more
               abstract, with their individual features more invariant to
               most of the variations that are typically present in the
               training distribution, while collectively preserving as much
               as possible of the information in the input. Ideally, we would
               like these representations to disentangle the unknown factors
               of variation that underlie the training distribution. Such
               unsupervised learning of representations can be exploited
               usefully under the hypothesis that the input distribution
               $P(x)$ is structurally related to some task of interest, say
               predicting $P(y|x)$. This paper focuses on the context of the
               Unsupervised and Transfer Learning Challenge, on why
               unsupervised pre-training of representations can be useful,
               and how it can be exploited in the transfer learning scenario,
               where we care about predictions on examples that are not from
               the same distribution as the training distribution.},
