abstract = {Most of the existing recommender systems use the ratings provided by users on individual items. An additional source of preference information is to use the ratings that users provide on sets of items. The advantages of using preferences on sets are twofold. First, a rating provided on a set conveys some preference information about each of the set’s items, which allows us to acquire a user’s preferences for more items than the number of ratings that the user provided. Second, due to privacy concerns, users may not be willing to reveal their preferences on individual items explicitly but may be willing to provide a single rating to a set of items, since it provides some level of information hiding. This article investigates two questions related to using set-level ratings in recommender systems. First, how users’ item-level ratings relate to their set-level ratings. Second, how collaborative filtering-based models for item-level rating prediction can take advantage of such set-level ratings. We have collected set-level ratings from active users of Movielens on sets of movies that they have rated in the past. Our analysis of these ratings shows that though the majority of the users provide the average of the ratings on a set’s constituent items as the rating on the set, there exists a significant number of users that tend to consistently either under- or over-rate the sets. We have developed collaborative filtering-based methods to explicitly model these user behaviors that can be used to recommend items to users. Experiments on real data and on synthetic data that resembles the under- or over-rating behavior in the real data demonstrate that these models can recover the overall characteristics of the underlying data and predict the user’s ratings on individual items.},

    abstract = "{Randomized experiments are the gold standard for causal inference and enable unbiased estimation of treatment effects. Regression adjustment provides a convenient way to incorporate covariate information for additional efficiency. This article provides a unified account of its utility for improving estimation efficiency in multiarmed experiments. We start with the commonly used additive and fully interacted models for regression adjustment in estimating average treatment effects (ATE), and clarify the trade-offs between the resulting ordinary least squares (OLS) estimators in terms of finite sample performance and asymptotic efficiency. We then move on to regression adjustment based on restricted least squares (RLS), and establish for the first time its properties for inferring ATE from the design-based perspective. The resulting inference has multiple guarantees. First, it is asymptotically efficient when the restriction is correctly specified. Second, it remains consistent as long as the restriction on the coefficients of the treatment indicators, if any, is correctly specified and separate from that on the coefficients of the treatment-covariate interactions. Third, it can have better finite sample performance than the unrestricted counterpart even when the restriction is moderately misspecified. It is thus our recommendation when the OLS fit of the fully interacted regression risks large finite sample variability in case of many covariates, many treatments, yet a moderate sample size. In addition, the newly established theory of RLS also provides a unified way of studying OLS-based inference from general regression specifications. As an illustration, we demonstrate its value for studying OLS-based regression adjustment in factorial experiments. Importantly, although we analyse inferential procedures that are motivated by OLS, we do not invoke any assumptions required by the underlying linear models.}",
