Binary embedding is a nonlinear dimension reduction methodology where high
dimensional data are embedded into the Hamming cube while preserving the
structure of the original space. Specifically, for an arbitrary $N$ distinct
points in $\mathbb{S}^{p-1}$, our goal is to encode each point using
$m$-dimensional binary strings such that we can reconstruct their geodesic
distance up to $\delta$ uniform distortion. Existing binary embedding
algorithms either lack theoretical guarantees or suffer from running time
$O\big(mp\big)$. We make three contributions: (1) we establish a lower bound
that shows any binary embedding oblivious to the set of points requires $m =
\Omega(\frac{1}{\delta^2}\log{N})$ bits and a similar lower bound for
non-oblivious embeddings into Hamming distance; (2) [DELETED, see comment]; (3)
we also provide an analytic result about embedding a general set of points $K
\subseteq \mathbb{S}^{p-1}$ with even infinite size. Our theoretical findings
are supported through experiments on both synthetic and real data sets.
