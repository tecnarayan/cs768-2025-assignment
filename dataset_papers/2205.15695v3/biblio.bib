  abstract = {We consider the problem of online scheduling on a single machine in order to minimize weighted flow time. The existing algorithms for this problem (STOC '01, SODA '03, FOCS '18) all require exact knowledge of the processing time of each job. This assumption is crucial, as even a slight perturbation of the processing time would lead to polynomial competitive ratio. However, this assumption very rarely holds in real-life scenarios. In this paper, we present the first algorithm for weighted flow time which do not require exact knowledge of the processing times of jobs. Specifically, we introduce the Scheduling with Predicted Processing Time (SPPT) problem, where the algorithm is given a prediction for the processing time of each job, instead of its real processing time. For the case of a constant factor distortion between the predictions and the real processing time, our algorithms match all the best known competitiveness bounds for weighted flow time -- namely \$O(\textbackslash log P), O(\textbackslash log D)\$ and \$O(\textbackslash log W)\$, where \$P,D,W\$ are the maximum ratios of processing times, densities, and weights, respectively. For larger errors, the competitiveness of our algorithms degrades gracefully.},

  abstract = {Scheduling a sequence of jobs released over time when the processing time of a job is only known at its completion is a classical problem in CPU scheduling in time sharing operating systems. A widely used measure for the responsiveness of the system is the average flow time of the jobs, that is, the average time spent by jobs in the system between release and completion.The Windows NT and the Unix operating system scheduling policies are based on the Multilevel Feedback algorithm. In this article, we prove that a randomized version of the Multilevel Feedback algorithm is competitive for single and parallel machine systems, in our opinion providing one theoretical validation of the goodness of an idea that has proven effective in practice along the last two decades.The randomized Multilevel Feedback algorithm (RMLF) was first proposed by Kalyanasundaram and Pruhs for a single machine achieving an O(log n log log n) competitive ratio to minimize the average flow time against the on-line adaptive adversary, where n is the number of jobs that are released. We present a version of RMLF working for any number m of parallel machines. We show for RMLF a first O(log n log n/m) competitiveness result against the oblivious adversary on parallel machines. We also show that the same RMLF algorithm surprisingly achieves a tight O(log n) competitive ratio against the oblivious adversary on a single machine, therefore matching the lower bound for this case.},

We introduce a mathematical model based on the online learning framework, in which the learner measures itself against a collection of experts that are also memory-constrained and that reflect different policies for what to remember. Interspersed with the stream of facts are occasional questions, and on each of these the learner incurs a loss if it has not remembered the corresponding fact. Its goal is to do almost as well as the best expert in hindsight, while using roughly the same amount of memory. We identify difficulties with using the multiplicative weights update algorithm in this memory-constrained scenario, and design an alternative scheme whose regret guarantees are close to the best possible.},

  abstract = {Within the context of stochastic probing with commitment, we consider the online stochastic matching problem; that is, the one sided online bipartite matching problem where edges adjacent to an online node must be probed to determine if they exist, based on known edge probabilities. If a probed edge exists, it must be used in the matching (if possible). We study this problem in the generality of a patience (or budget) constraint which limits the number of probes that can be made to edges adjacent to an online node. The patience constraint results in modelling and computational efficiency issues that are not encountered in the special cases of unit patience and full (i.e., unlimited) patience. The stochastic matching problem leads to a variety of settings. Our main contribution is to provide a new LP relaxation and a unified approach for establishing new and improved competitive bounds in three different input model settings (namely, adversarial, random order, and known i.i.d.). In all these settings, the algorithm does not have any control on the ordering of the online nodes. We establish competitive bounds in these settings, all of which generalize the standard non-stochastic setting when edges do not need to be probed (i.e., exist with certainty). All of our competitive ratios hold for arbitrary edge probabilities and patience constraints: (1) A \$1-1/e\$ ratio when the stochastic graph is known, offline vertices are weighted and online arrivals are adversarial. (2) A \$1-1/e\$ ratio when the stochastic graph is known, edges are weighted, and online arrivals are given in random order (i.e., in ROM, the random order model). (3) A \$1-1/e\$ ratio when online arrivals are drawn i.i.d. from a known stochastic type graph and edges are weighted. (4) A (tight) \$1/e\$ ratio when the stochastic graph is unknown, edges are weighted and online arrivals are given in random order.},

This continuized variant benefits from the best of the continuous and the discrete frameworks: as a continuous process, one can use differential calculus to analyze convergence and obtain analytical expressions for the parameters; and a discretization of the continuized process can be computed exactly with convergence rates similar to those of Nesterov original acceleration. We show that the discretization has the same structure as Nesterov acceleration, but with random parameters. We provide continuized Nesterov acceleration under deterministic as well as stochastic gradients, with either additive or multiplicative noise. Finally, using our continuized framework and expressing the gossip averaging problem as the stochastic minimization of a certain energy function, we provide the first rigorous acceleration of asynchronous gossip algorithms.},

In this problem, jobs can have different arrival times and sizes; a scheduler can process job \$j\$ at rate \$x\_j\$, subject to arbitrary packing constraints over the set of rates (\$\textbackslash vec\{x\}\$) of the outstanding jobs. The PSP framework captures a variety of scheduling problems, including the classical problems of unrelated machines scheduling, broadcast scheduling, and scheduling jobs of different parallelizability. It also captures scheduling constraints arising in diverse modern environments ranging from individual computer architectures to data centers. More concretely, PSP models multidimensional resource requirements and parallelizability, as well as network bandwidth requirements found in data center scheduling. In this paper, we design non-clairvoyant online algorithms for PSP and its special cases -- in this setting, the scheduler is unaware of the sizes of jobs. Our two main results are, 1) a constant competitive algorithm for minimizing total weighted completion time for PSP and 2)a scalable algorithm for minimizing the total flow-time on unrelated machines, which is a special case of PSP.},

  abstract = {In non-clairvoyant scheduling, the task is to nd an online strategy for scheduling jobs with a priori unknown processing requirements with the objective to minimize the total (weighted) completion time. We revisit this well-studied problem in a recently popular learning-augmented setting that integrates (untrusted) predictions in online algorithm design. While previous works used predictions on processing requirements, we propose a new prediction model, which provides a relative order of jobs which could be seen as predicting algorithmic actions rather than parts of the unknown input. We show that these predictions have desired properties, admit a natural error measure as well as algorithms with strong performance guarantees and that they are learnable in both, theory and practice. We generalize the algorithmic framework proposed in the seminal paper by Kumar et al. (NeurIPS'18) and present the rst learning-augmented scheduling results for weighted jobs and unrelated machines. We demonstrate in empirical experiments the practicability and superior performance compared to the previously suggested single-machine algorithms.},

We obtain nonasymptotic, distribution-dependent bounds and provide simple proofs based only on well-known properties of Kullback–Leibler divergences. These bounds show in particular that in the initial phase the regret grows almost linearly, and that the well-known logarithmic growth of the regret only holds in a final phase. The proof techniques come to the essence of the information-theoretic arguments used and they involve no unnecessary complications. }
