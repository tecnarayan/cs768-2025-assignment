	abstract = {The link between mind, brain, and behavior has mystified philosophers and scientists for millennia. Recent progress has been made by forming statistical associations between manifest variables of the brain (e.g., electroencephalogram [EEG], functional MRI [fMRI]) and manifest variables of behavior (e.g., response times, accuracy) through hierarchical latent variable models. Within this framework, one can make inferences about the mind in a statistically principled way, such that complex patterns of brain{\textendash}behavior associations drive the inference procedure. However, previous approaches were limited in the flexibility of the linking function, which has proved prohibitive for understanding the complex dynamics exhibited by the brain. In this article, we propose a data-driven, nonparametric approach that allows complex linking functions to emerge from fitting a hierarchical latent representation of the mind to multivariate, multimodal data. Furthermore, to enforce biological plausibility, we impose both spatial and temporal structure so that the types of realizable system dynamics are constrained. To illustrate the benefits of our approach, we investigate the model{\textquoteright}s performance in a simulation study and apply it to experimental data. In the simulation study, we verify that the model can be accurately fitted to simulated data, and latent dynamics can be well recovered. In an experimental application, we simultaneously fit the model to fMRI and behavioral data from a continuous motion tracking task. We show that the model accurately recovers both neural and behavioral data and reveals interesting latent cognitive dynamics, the topology of which can be contrasted with several aspects of the experiment.All code and data that accompany this article can be downloaded from GitHub: http://github.com/MbCN-lab/gpjm and http://github.com/GiwonBahg/gpjm.

    abstract = "{A growing number of studies approach the brain as a complex network, the so-called ‘connectome’. Adopting this framework, we examine what types or extent of damage the brain can withstand—referred to as network ‘robustness’—and conversely, which kind of distortions can be expected after brain lesions. To this end, we review computational lesion studies and empirical studies investigating network alterations in brain tumour, stroke and traumatic brain injury patients. Common to these three types of focal injury is that there is no unequivocal relationship between the anatomical lesion site and its topological characteristics within the brain network. Furthermore, large-scale network effects of these focal lesions are compared to those of a widely studied multifocal neurodegenerative disorder, Alzheimer’s disease, in which central parts of the connectome are preferentially affected. Results indicate that human brain networks are remarkably resilient to different types of lesions, compared to other types of complex networks such as random or scale-free networks. However, lesion effects have been found to depend critically on the topological position of the lesion. In particular, damage to network hub regions—and especially those connecting different subnetworks—was found to cause the largest disturbances in network organization. Regardless of lesion location, evidence from empirical and computational lesion studies shows that lesions cause significant alterations in global network topology. The direction of these changes though remains to be elucidated. Encouragingly, both empirical and modelling studies have indicated that after focal damage, the connectome carries the potential to recover at least to some extent, with normalization of graph metrics being related to improved behavioural and cognitive functioning. To conclude, we highlight possible clinical implications of these findings, point out several methodological limitations that pertain to the study of brain diseases adopting a network approach, and provide suggestions for future research.}",
