In this paper, sample-aware policy entropy regularization is proposed to
enhance the conventional policy entropy regularization for better exploration.
Exploiting the sample distribution obtainable from the replay buffer, the
proposed sample-aware entropy regularization maximizes the entropy of the
weighted sum of the policy action distribution and the sample action
distribution from the replay buffer for sample-efficient exploration. A
practical algorithm named diversity actor-critic (DAC) is developed by applying
policy iteration to the objective function with the proposed sample-aware
entropy regularization. Numerical results show that DAC significantly
outperforms existing recent algorithms for reinforcement learning.
