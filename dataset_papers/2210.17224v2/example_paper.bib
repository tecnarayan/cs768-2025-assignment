  abstract = 	 {This work develops mixup for graph data. Mixup has shown superiority in improving the generalization and robustness of neural networks by interpolating features and labels between two random samples. Traditionally, Mixup can work on regular, grid-like, and Euclidean data such as image or tabular data. However, it is challenging to directly adopt Mixup to augment graph data because different graphs typically: 1) have different numbers of nodes; 2) are not readily aligned; and 3) have unique typologies in non-Euclidean space. To this end, we propose G-Mixup to augment graphs for graph classification by interpolating the generator (i.e., graphon) of different classes of graphs. Specifically, we first use graphs within the same class to estimate a graphon. Then, instead of directly manipulating graphs, we interpolate graphons of different classes in the Euclidean space to get mixed graphons, where the synthetic graphs are generated through sampling based on the mixed graphons. Extensive experiments show that G-Mixup substantially improves the generalization and robustness of GNNs.}

Recently, GCNs and subsequent variants have shown superior performance in various application areas on real-world datasets. Despite their success, most of the current GCN models are shallow, due to the \emph{over-smoothing} problem. In this paper, we study the problem of designing and analyzing deep graph convolutional networks. We propose the GCNII, an extension of the vanilla GCN model with two simple yet effective techniques: \emph{Initial residual} and \emph{Identity mapping}. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence that the two techniques effectively relieves the problem of over-smoothing. Our experiments show that the deep GCNII model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on various semi- and full-supervised tasks.} }

  abstract = 	 {Recent deep learning approaches for representation learning on graphs follow a neighborhood aggregation procedure. We analyze some important properties of these models, and propose a strategy to overcome those. In particular, the range of "neighboring" nodes that a node’s representation draws from strongly depends on the graph structure, analogous to the spread of a random walk. To adapt to local neighborhood properties and tasks, we explore an architecture – jumping knowledge (JK) networks – that flexibly leverages, for each node, different neighborhood ranges to enable better structure-aware representation. In a number of experiments on social, bioinformatics and citation networks, we demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, combining the JK framework with models like Graph Convolutional Networks, GraphSAGE and Graph Attention Networks consistently improves those models’ performance.}

  abstract = 	 {Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are powerful deep neural networks for graph-structured data. However, GCN computes the representation of a node recursively from its neighbors, making the receptive field size grow exponentially with the number of layers. Previous attempts on reducing the receptive field size by subsampling neighbors do not have convergence guarantee, and their receptive field size per node is still in the order of hundreds. In this paper, we develop control variate based algorithms with new theoretical guarantee to converge to a local optimum of GCN regardless of the neighbor sampling size. Empirical results show that our algorithms enjoy similar convergence rate and model quality with the exact algorithm using only two neighbors per node. The running time of our algorithms on a large Reddit dataset is only one seventh of previous neighbor sampling algorithms.}

	abstract = {In many physical systems, the governing equations are known with high confidence, but direct numerical solution is prohibitively expensive. Often this situation is alleviated by writing effective equations to approximate dynamics below the grid scale. This process is often impossible to perform analytically and is often ad hoc. Here we propose data-driven discretization, a method that uses machine learning to systematically derive discretizations for continuous physical systems. On a series of model problems, data-driven discretization gives accurate solutions with a dramatic drop in required resolution.The numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) is challenging because of the need to resolve spatiotemporal features over wide length- and timescales. Often, it is computationally intractable to resolve the finest features in the solution. The only recourse is to use approximate coarse-grained representations, which aim to accurately represent long-wavelength dynamics while properly accounting for unresolved small-scale physics. Deriving such coarse-grained equations is notoriously difficult and often ad hoc. Here we introduce data-driven discretization, a method for learning optimized approximations to PDEs based on actual solutions to the known underlying equations. Our approach uses neural networks to estimate spatial derivatives, which are optimized end to end to best satisfy the equations on a low-resolution grid. The resulting numerical methods are remarkably accurate, allowing us to integrate in time a collection of nonlinear equations in 1 spatial dimension at resolutions 4{\texttimes} to 8{\texttimes} coarser than is possible with standard finite-difference methods.},

Protein structure and function is determined by the arrangement of the linear sequence of amino acids in 3D space. We show that a deep graph neural network, ProteinSolver, can precisely design sequences that fold into a predetermined shape by phrasing this challenge as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP), akin to Sudoku puzzles. We trained ProteinSolver on over 70,000,000 real protein sequences corresponding to over 80,000 structures. We show that our method rapidly designs new protein sequences and benchmark them in silico using energy-based scores, molecular dynamics, and structure prediction methods. As a proof-of-principle validation, we use ProteinSolver to generate sequences that match the structure of serum albumin, then synthesize the top-scoring design and validate it in vitro using circular dichroism. ProteinSolver is freely available at http://design.proteinsolver.org and https://gitlab.com/ostrokach/proteinsolver. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the Supplemental Information."

abstract="Videos contain highly redundant information between frames. Such redundancy has been studied extensively in video compression and encoding, but is less explored for more advanced video processing. In this paper, we propose a learnable unified framework for propagating a variety of visual properties of video images, including but not limited to color, high dynamic range (HDR), and segmentation mask, where the properties are available for only a few key-frames. Our approach is based on a temporal propagation network (TPN), which models the transition-related affinity between a pair of frames in a purely data-driven manner. We theoretically prove two essential properties of TPN: (a) by regularizing the global transformation matrix as orthogonal, the ``style energy'' of the property can be well preserved during propagation; and (b) such regularization can be achieved by the proposed switchable TPN with bi-directional training on pairs of frames. We apply the switchable TPN to three tasks: colorizing a gray-scale video based on a few colored key-frames, generating an HDR video from a low dynamic range (LDR) video and a few HDR frames, and propagating a segmentation mask from the first frame in videos. Experimental results show that our approach is significantly more accurate and efficient than the state-of-the-art methods.",

abstract="This paper introduces a network for volumetric segmentation that learns from sparsely annotated volumetric images. We outline two attractive use cases of this method: (1) In a semi-automated setup, the user annotates some slices in the volume to be segmented. The network learns from these sparse annotations and provides a dense 3D segmentation. (2) In a fully-automated setup, we assume that a representative, sparsely annotated training set exists. Trained on this data set, the network densely segments new volumetric images. The proposed network extends the previous u-net architecture from Ronneberger et al. by replacing all 2D operations with their 3D counterparts. The implementation performs on-the-fly elastic deformations for efficient data augmentation during training. It is trained end-to-end from scratch, i.e., no pre-trained network is required. We test the performance of the proposed method on a complex, highly variable 3D structure, the Xenopus kidney, and achieve good results for both use cases.",

    abstract = { AbstractDetecting a specific horizon in seismic images is a valuable tool for geologic interpretation. Because hand picking the locations of the horizon is a time-consuming process, automated computational methods were developed starting three decades ago. Until now, most networks have been trained on data that were created by cutting larger seismic images into many small patches. This limits the networks ability to learn from large-scale geologic structures. Moreover, currently available networks and training strategies require label patches that have full and continuous horizon picks (annotations), which are also time-consuming to generate. We have developed a projected loss function that enables training on labels with just a few annotated pixels and has no issue with the other unknown label pixels. We use this loss function for training convolutional networks with a multiresolution structure, including variants of the U-net. Our networks learn from a small number of large seismic images without creating patches. Training uses all seismic data without reserving some for validation. Only the labels are split into training/testing. We validate the accuracy of the trained network using the horizon picks that were never shown to the network. Contrary to other work on horizon tracking, we train the network to perform nonlinear regression, not classification. As such, we generate labels as the convolution of a Gaussian kernel and the known horizon locations that communicate uncertainty in the labels. The network output is the probability of the horizon location. We examine the new method on two different data sets, one for horizon extrapolation and another data set for interpolation. We found that the predictions of our methodology are accurate even in areas far from known horizon locations because our learning strategy exploits all data in large seismic images. }

	abstract="Seismic surveys are routinely carried out in three dimensions, resulting in large volumes of high-resolution seismic data and a corresponding increase in the workload of an interpreter. An automatic tracker is described in this chapter, based on artificial neural networks (ANNs), which enables horizons to be tracked in three dimensions with less input from an interpreter compared to most commercial automatic trackers. More time can therefore be spent by the interpreter investigating geologically complex areas. A hybrid ANN is employed which combines both unsupervised (self-organising feature map) and supervised (multilayer perceptron) network paradigms. The tracker is demonstrated on a real three-dimensional (3-D) seismic data set, and is shown to be a viable technique for use as a standard tool and for enhancing efficiency in 3-D seismic interpretation. 1.5-D and 2-D methods have also been demonstrated successfully, which account for the seismic character above, below, behind and ahead of the current tracking position.",

The same technique can be applied successfully to detect faults in 3D seismic data. We show that several different attributes – among others, similarity, frequency and curvature, all of which potentially enhance the visibility of faults – can be combined successfully by an artificial neural network. This results in a fault ‘probability’ cube in which faults are more continuous and noise is suppressed compared with single-attribute cubes. It is believed that the fault-cube can be improved further by applying image-processing techniques to enhance the fault prediction.}
