	abstract = 	 {We consider the stochastic bandit problem with a continuous set of arms, with the expected reward function over the arms assumed to be fixed but unknown. We provide two new Gaussian process-based algorithms for continuous bandit optimization – Improved GP-UCB (IGP-UCB) and GP-Thomson sampling (GP-TS), and derive corresponding regret bounds. Specifically, the bounds hold when the expected reward function belongs to the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) that naturally corresponds to a Gaussian process kernel used as input by the algorithms. Along the way, we derive a new self-normalized concentration inequality for vector-valued martingales of arbitrary, possibly infinite, dimension. Finally, experimental evaluation and comparisons to existing algorithms on synthetic and real-world environments are carried out that highlight the favourable gains of the proposed strategies in many cases.}

We provide two new {G}aussian  process-based algorithms for continuous bandit optimization – Improved GP-UCB (IGP-UCB) and GP-Thomson sampling (GP-TS), and derive corresponding regret bounds. Specifically, the bounds hold when the expected reward function belongs to the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) that naturally corresponds to a {G}aussian  process kernel used as input by the algorithms. Along the way, we derive a new self-normalized concentration inequality for vector-valued martingales of arbitrary, possibly infinite, dimension. Finally, experimental evaluation and comparisons to existing algorithms on synthetic and real-world environments are carried out that highlight the favourable gains of the proposed strategies in many cases.} }

When combining learning with control methods, probabilistic regression is typically applied to increase robustness against learning errors and analyze the stability of the closed-loop system. Although this approach allows to formulate performance guarantees for many control techniques, the obtained bounds are usually conservative, and cannot be employed for efficient control parameter tuning. Therefore, we reformulate the parameter tuning problem using robust optimization with performance constraints based on Lyapunov theory. By relaxing the problem through scenario optimization we derive a provably optimal method for control parameter tuning. We demonstrate its flexibility and efficiency on parameter tuning problems for a feedback linearizing and a computed torque controller.} }

This requires balancing exploration (learning about the objective) and exploitation (localizing the maximum), a problem well-studied in the multi-armed bandit literature. In many applications, however, we require that the sampled function values exceed some prespecified "safety" threshold, a requirement that existing algorithms fail to meet. Examples include medical applications where patient comfort must be guaranteed, recommender systems aiming to avoid user dissatisfaction, and robotic control, where one seeks to avoid controls causing physical harm to the platform. We tackle this novel, yet rich, set of problems under the assumption that the unknown function satisfies regularity conditions expressed via a {G}aussian  process prior. We develop an efficient algorithm called SafeOpt, and theoretically guarantee its convergence to a natural notion of optimum reachable under safety constraints. We evaluate SafeOpt on synthetic data, as well as two real applications: movie recommendation, and therapeutic spinal cord stimulation.} }

	abstract = 	 {Robots operating in unstructured, complex, and changing real-world environments should navigate and maintain safety while collecting data about its environment and updating its model dynamics. In this paper, we consider the problem of using a robot to explore an environment with an unknown, state-dependent disturbance to the dynamics and forbidden areas. The goal of the robot is to safely collect observations on the disturbance and construct an accurate estimate of the underlying function. We use Gaussian process to get an estimate of the disturbance from data with a high-confidence bound on the regression error. Furthermore, we use neural contraction metrics to derive a tracking controller and the corresponding high-confidence uncertainty tube around the nominal trajectory planned for the robot, based on the estimate of the disturbance. From the robustness of the Contraction Metric, error bound can be pre-computed and used by the motion planner such that the actual trajectory is guaranteed to be safe. }
