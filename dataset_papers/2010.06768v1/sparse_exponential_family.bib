@inproceedings{khan2017conjugate,
	Abstract = {Variational inference is computationally challenging in models that contain both conjugate and non-conjugate terms. Methods specifically designed for conjugate models, even though computationally efficient, find it difficult to deal with non-conjugate terms. On the other hand, stochastic-gradient methods can handle the non-conjugate terms but they usually ignore the conjugate structure of the model which might result in slow convergence. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm called Conjugate-computation Variational Inference (CVI) which brings the best of the two worlds together -- it uses conjugate computations for the conjugate terms and employs stochastic gradients for the rest. We derive this algorithm by using a stochastic mirror-descent method in the mean-parameter space, and then expressing each gradient step as a variational inference in a conjugate model. We demonstrate our algorithm's applicability to a large class of models and establish its convergence. Our experimental results show that our method converges much faster than the methods that ignore the conjugate structure of the model. },

	Abstract = { Many traits of interest are highly heritable and genetically complex, meaning that much of the variation they exhibit arises from differences at numerous loci in the genome. Complex traits and their evolution have been studied for more than a century, but only in the last decade have genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in humans begun to reveal their genetic basis. Here, we bring these threads of research together to ask how findings from GWASs can further our understanding of the processes that give rise to heritable variation in complex traits and of the genetic basis of complex trait evolution in response to changing selection pressures (i.e., of polygenic adaptation). Conversely, we ask how evolutionary thinking helps us to interpret findings from GWASs and informs related efforts of practical importance. },

@article{lauritzen1988local,
	Abstract = {A causal network is used in a number of areas as a depiction of patterns of `influence' among sets of variables. In expert systems it is common to perform `inference' by means of local computations on such large but sparse networks. In general, non-probabilistic methods are used to handle uncertainty when propagating the effects of evidence, and it has appeared that exact probabilistic methods are not computationally feasible. Motivated by an application in electromyography, we counter this claim by exploiting a range of local representations for the joint probability distribution, combined with topological changes to the original network termed `marrying' and `filling-in'. The resulting structure allows efficient algorithms for transfer between representations, providing rapid absorption and propagation of evidence. The scheme is first illustrated on a small, fictitious but challenging example, and the underlying theory and computational aspects are then discussed.},
