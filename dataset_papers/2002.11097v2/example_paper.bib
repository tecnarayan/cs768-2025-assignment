	abstract = {Explaining complex or seemingly simple machine learning models is a practical and ethical question, as well as a legal issue. Can I trust the model? Is it biased? Can I explain it to others? We want to explain individual predictions from a complex machine learning model by learning simple, interpretable explanations. Of existing work on interpreting complex models, Shapley values is regarded to be the only model-agnostic explanation method with a solid theoretical foundation. Kernel SHAP is a computationally efficient approximation to Shapley values in higher dimensions. Like several other existing methods, this approach assumes independent features, which may give very wrong explanations. This is the case even if a simple linear model is used for predictions. We extend the Kernel SHAP method to handle dependent features. We provide several examples of linear and non-linear models with linear and non-linear feature dependence, where our method gives more accurate approximations to the true Shapley values. We also propose a method for aggregating individual Shapley values, such that the prediction can be explained by groups of dependent variables.},

	title = {The {Intuitive} {Appeal} of {Explainable} {Machines}},
	url = {https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3126971},
	abstract = {Algorithmic decision-making has become synonymous with inexplicable decision-making, but what makes algorithms so difficult to explain? This Article examines what sets machine learning apart from other ways of developing rules for decision-making and the problem these properties pose for explanation. We show that machine learning models can be both inscrutable and nonintuitive and that these are related, but distinct, properties.Calls for explanation have treated these problems as one and the same, but disentangling the two reveals that they demand very different responses. Dealing with inscrutability requires providing a sensible description of the rules; addressing nonintuitiveness requires providing a satisfying explanation for why the rules are what they are. Existing laws like the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), as well as techniques within machine learning, are focused almost entirely on the problem of inscrutability. While such techniques could allow a machine learning system to comply with existing law, doing so may not help if the goal is to assess whether the basis for decision-making is normatively defensible.In most cases, intuition serves as the unacknowledged bridge between a descriptive account and a normative evaluation. But because machine learning is often valued for its ability to uncover statistical relationships that defy intuition, relying on intuition is not a satisfying approach. This Article thus argues for other mechanisms for normative evaluation. To know why the rules are what they are, one must seek explanations of the process behind a modelâs development, not just explanations of the model itself.},

	abstract = {Despite a growing literature on creating interpretable machine learning methods, there have been few experimental studies of their effects on end users. We present a series of large-scale, randomized, pre-registered experiments in which participants were shown functionally identical models that varied only in two factors thought to influence interpretability: the number of input features and the model transparency (clear or black-box). Participants who were shown a clear model with a small number of features were better able to simulate the model's predictions. However, contrary to what one might expect when manipulating interpretability, we found no significant difference in multiple measures of trust across conditions. Even more surprisingly, increased transparency hampered people's ability to detect when a model has made a sizeable mistake. These findings emphasize the importance of studying how models are presented to people and empirically verifying that interpretable models achieve their intended effects on end users.},

	abstract = {As machine learning systems become ubiquitous, there has been a surge of interest in interpretable machine learning: systems that provide explanation for their outputs. These explanations are often used to qualitatively assess other criteria such as safety or non-discrimination. However, despite the interest in interpretability, there is very little consensus on what interpretable machine learning is and how it should be measured. In this position paper, we first define interpretability and describe when interpretability is needed (and when it is not). Next, we suggest a taxonomy for rigorous evaluation and expose open questions towards a more rigorous science of interpretable machine learning.},

Drawing on research in CSCW, critical data studies, and history and sociology of science, and six months of immersive ethnographic fieldwork with a corporate data science team, we describe four common tensions in applied data science work: (un)equivocal numbers, (counter)intuitive knowledge, (in)credible data, and (in)scrutable models. We show how organizational actors establish and re-negotiate trust under messy and uncertain analytic conditions through practices of skepticism, assessment, and credibility. Highlighting the collaborative and heterogeneous nature of real-world data science, we show how the management of trust in applied corporate data science settings depends not only on pre-processing and quantification, but also on negotiation and translation. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for data science research and practice, both within and beyond CSCW.},
