  abstract  = {Word embedding models have been shown to be effective in
               performing a wide variety of Natural Language Processing
               (NLP) tasks such as identifying audiences for web
               advertisements, parsing resum\'{e}s to select promising job
               candidates, and translating documents from one language to
               another. However, it has been demonstrated that NLP systems
               learn gender bias from the corpora of documents on which
               they are trained. It is increasingly common for pre-trained
               models to be used as a starting point for building
               applications in a wide range of areas including critical
               decision making applications. It is also very easy to use a
               pre-trained model as the basis for a new application
               without careful consideration of the original nature of the
               training set. In this paper, we quantify the degree to
               which gender bias differs with the corpora used for
               training. We look especially at the impact of starting with
               a pre-trained model and fine-tuning with additional data.
               Specifically, we calculate a measure of direct gender bias
               on several pre-trained models including BERT’s Wikipedia
               and Book corpus models as well as on several fine-tuned
               General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE)
               benchmarks. In addition, we evaluate the bias from several
               more extreme corpora including the Jigsaw identity toxic
               dataset that includes toxic speech biased against race,
               gender, religion, and disability and the RtGender dataset
               that includes speech specifically labelled by gender. Our
               results reveal that the direct gender bias of the Jigsaw
               toxic identity dataset is surprisingly close to that of the
               base pre-trained Google model, but the RtGender dataset has
               significantly higher direct gender bias than the base
               model. When the bias learned by an NLP system can vary
               significantly with the corpora used for training, it
               becomes important to consider and report these details,
               especially for use in critical decision-making
               applications.},

  abstract = {The field of natural language processing has seen
              impressive progress in recent years, with neural network
              models replacing many of the traditional systems. A
              plethora of new models have been proposed, many of which
              are thought to be opaque compared to their feature-rich
              counterparts. This has led researchers to analyze,
              interpret, and evaluate neural networks in novel and more
              fine-grained ways. In this survey paper, we review analysis
              methods in neural language processing, categorize them
              according to prominent research trends, highlight existing
              limitations, and point to potential directions for future
              work.}

  abstract  = {This paper describes a testing methodology for
               quantitatively assessing the risk that rare or unique
               training-data sequences are unintentionally memorized by
               generative sequence models--a common type of
               machine-learning model. Because such models are sometimes
               trained on sensitive data (e.g., the text of users' private
               messages), this methodology can benefit privacy by allowing
               deep-learning practitioners to select means of training
               that minimize such memorization.In experiments, we show
               that unintended memorization is a persistent, hard-to-avoid
               issue that can have serious consequences. Specifically, for
               models trained without consideration of memorization, we
               describe new, efficient procedures that can extract unique,
               secret sequences, such as credit card numbers. We show that
               our testing strategy is a practical and easy-to-use first
               line of defense, e.g., by describing its application to
               quantitatively limit data exposure in Google's Smart
               Compose, a commercial text-completion neural network
               trained on millions of users' email messages.},

  abstract  = {Large pre-trained neural networks such as BERT have had
               great recent success in NLP, motivating a growing body of
               research investigating what aspects of language they are
               able to learn from unlabeled data. Most recent analysis has
               focused on model outputs (e.g., language model surprisal)
               or internal vector representations (e.g., probing
               classifiers). Complementary to these works, we propose
               methods for analyzing the attention mechanisms of
               pre-trained models and apply them to BERT. BERT{'}s
               attention heads exhibit patterns such as attending to
               delimiter tokens, specific positional offsets, or broadly
               attending over the whole sentence, with heads in the same
               layer often exhibiting similar behaviors. We further show
               that certain attention heads correspond well to linguistic
               notions of syntax and coreference. For example, we find
               heads that attend to the direct objects of verbs,
               determiners of nouns, objects of prepositions, and
               coreferent mentions with remarkably high accuracy. Lastly,
               we propose an attention-based probing classifier and use it
               to further demonstrate that substantial syntactic
               information is captured in BERT{'}s attention.}

               high-quality sentence embeddings, we still have a poor
               understanding of what they are capturing.
               {``}Downstream{''} tasks, often based on sentence
               classification, are commonly used to evaluate the quality
               of sentence representations. The complexity of the tasks
               makes it however difficult to infer what kind of
               information is present in the representations. We introduce
               here 10 probing tasks designed to capture simple linguistic
               features of sentences, and we use them to study embeddings
               generated by three different encoders trained in eight
               distinct ways, uncovering intriguing properties of both
               encoders and training methods.}

               good at recalling factual knowledge presented in the

               studies on how factual knowledge is stored in pretrained
               Transformers by introducing the concept of knowledge
               neurons. Specifically, we examine the fill-in-the-blank
               cloze task for BERT. Given a relational fact, we propose a
               knowledge attribution method to identify the neurons that
               express the fact. We find that the activation of such
               knowledge neurons is positively correlated to the
               expression of their corresponding facts. In our case
               studies, we attempt to leverage knowledge neurons to edit
               (such as update, and erase) specific factual knowledge
               without fine-tuning. Our results shed light on
               understanding the storage of knowledge within pretrained
               Transformers.}

               occupation classification, a task where the use of machine
               learning may lead to negative outcomes on peoples' lives.
               We analyze the potential allocation harms that can result
               from semantic representation bias. To do so, we study the
               impact on occupation classification of including explicit
               gender indicators---such as first names and pronouns---in
               different semantic representations of online biographies.
               Additionally, we quantify the bias that remains when these
               indicators are "scrubbed," and describe proxy behavior that
               occurs in the absence of explicit gender indicators. As we
               demonstrate, differences in true positive rates between
               genders are correlated with existing gender imbalances in
               occupations, which may compound these imbalances.},

  abstract  = {We introduce a new language representation model called
               BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder
               Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language
               representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et
               al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-train deep
               bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by
               jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all
               layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be
               fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create
               state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as
               question answering and language inference, without
               substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT
               is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains
               new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language
               processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5
               (7.7 point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to
               86.7{\%} (4.6{\%} absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1
               question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute
               improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point

  abstract  = {Recent advances in deep learning techniques have enabled
               machines to generate cohesive open-ended text when prompted
               with a sequence of words as context. While these models now
               empower many downstream applications from conversation bots
               to automatic storytelling, they have been shown to generate
               texts that exhibit social biases. To systematically study
               and benchmark social biases in open-ended language
               generation, we introduce the Bias in Open-Ended Language
               Generation Dataset (BOLD), a large-scale dataset that
               consists of 23,679 English text generation prompts for bias
               benchmarking across five domains: profession, gender, race,
               religion, and political ideology. We also propose new
               automated metrics for toxicity, psycholinguistic norms, and
               text gender polarity to measure social biases in open-ended
               text generation from multiple angles. An examination of
               text generated from three popular language models reveals
               that the majority of these models exhibit a larger social
               bias than human-written Wikipedia text across all domains.
               With these results we highlight the need to benchmark
               biases in open-ended language generation and caution users
               of language generation models on downstream tasks to be
               cognizant of these embedded prejudices.},

  abstract  = {Neural abstractive summarization models are prone to
               generate content inconsistent with the source document,
               i.e. unfaithful. Existing automatic metrics do not capture
               such mistakes effectively. We tackle the problem of
               evaluating faithfulness of a generated summary given its
               source document. We first collected human annotations of
               faithfulness for outputs from numerous models on two
               datasets. We find that current models exhibit a trade-off
               between abstractiveness and faithfulness: outputs with less
               word overlap with the source document are more likely to be
               unfaithful. Next, we propose an automatic question
               answering (QA) based metric for faithfulness, FEQA, which
               leverages recent advances in reading comprehension. Given
               question-answer pairs generated from the summary, a QA
               model extracts answers from the document; non-matched
               answers indicate unfaithful information in the summary.
               Among metrics based on word overlap, embedding similarity,
               and learned language understanding models, our QA-based
               metric has significantly higher correlation with human
               faithfulness scores, especially on highly abstractive
               summaries.}

  abstract = {The scarcity of comprehensive up-to-date studies on
              evaluation metrics for text summarization and the lack of
              consensus regarding evaluation protocols continues to
              inhibit progress. We address the existing shortcomings of
              summarization evaluation methods along five dimensions: 1)
              we re-evaluate 12 automatic evaluation metrics in a
              comprehensive and consistent fashion using neural
              summarization model outputs along with expert and
              crowd-sourced human annotations, 2) we consistently
              benchmark 23 recent summarization models using the
              aforementioned automatic evaluation metrics, 3) we assemble
              the largest collection of summaries generated by models
              trained on the CNN/DailyMail news dataset and share it in a
              unified format, 4) we implement and share a toolkit that
              provides an extensible and unified API for evaluating
              summarization models across a broad range of automatic
              metrics, 5) we assemble and share the largest and most
              diverse, in terms of model types, collection of human
              judgments of model-generated summaries on the CNN/Daily
              Mail dataset annotated by both expert judges and crowd
              source workers. We hope that this work will help promote a
              more complete evaluation protocol for text summarization as
              well as advance research in developing evaluation metrics
              that better correlate with human judgements.},

               to remarkably fluent summaries, factual errors in generated
               summaries still severely limit their use in practice. In
               this paper, we evaluate summaries produced by
               state-of-the-art models via crowdsourcing and show that
               such errors occur frequently, in particular with more
               abstractive models. We study whether textual entailment
               predictions can be used to detect such errors and if they
               can be reduced by reranking alternative predicted
               summaries. That leads to an interesting downstream
               application for entailment models. In our experiments, we
               find that out-of-the-box entailment models trained on NLI
               datasets do not yet offer the desired performance for the
               downstream task and we therefore release our annotations as
               additional test data for future extrinsic evaluations of
               NLI.}

  abstract  = {Existing open-domain dialog models are generally trained
               to minimize the perplexity of target human responses.
               However, some human replies are more engaging than others,
               spawning more followup interactions. Current conversational
               models are increasingly capable of producing turns that are
               context-relevant, but in order to produce compelling
               agents, these models need to be able to predict and
               optimize for turns that are genuinely engaging. We leverage
               social media feedback data (number of replies and upvotes)
               to build a large-scale training dataset for feedback
               prediction. To alleviate possible distortion between the
               feedback and engagingness, we convert the ranking problem
               to a comparison of response pairs which involve few
               confounding factors. We trained DialogRPT, a set of GPT-2
               based models on 133M pairs of human feedback data and the
               resulting ranker outperformed several baselines.
               Particularly, our ranker outperforms the conventional
               dialog perplexity baseline with a large margin on
               predicting Reddit feedback. We finally combine the feedback
               prediction models and a human-like scoring model to rank
               the machine-generated dialog responses. Crowd-sourced human
               evaluation shows that our ranking method correlates better
               with real human preferences than baseline models.}

               million articles and summaries written by authors and
               editors in newsrooms of 38 major news publications.
               Extracted from search and social media metadata between
               1998 and 2017, these high-quality summaries demonstrate
               high diversity of summarization styles. In particular, the
               summaries combine abstractive and extractive strategies,
               borrowing words and phrases from articles at varying rates.

               the success of these broad-coverage models, we investigate
               whether it is still helpful to tailor a pretrained model to
               the domain of a target task. We present a study across four
               domains (biomedical and computer science publications,
               news, and reviews) and eight classification tasks, showing
               that a second phase of pretraining in-domain
               (domain-adaptive pretraining) leads to performance gains,
               under both high- and low-resource settings. Moreover,
               adapting to the task{'}s unlabeled data (task-adaptive
               pretraining) improves performance even after
               domain-adaptive pretraining. Finally, we show that adapting
               to a task corpus augmented using simple data selection
               strategies is an effective alternative, especially when
               resources for domain-adaptive pretraining might be
               unavailable. Overall, we consistently find that multi-phase
               adaptive pretraining offers large gains in task
               performance.}

  abstract  = {Modern deep learning models for NLP are notoriously
               opaque. This has motivated the development of methods for
               interpreting such models, e.g., via gradient-based saliency
               maps or the visualization of attention weights. Such
               approaches aim to provide explanations for a particular
               model prediction by highlighting important words in the
               corresponding input text. While this might be useful for
               tasks where decisions are explicitly influenced by
               individual tokens in the input, we suspect that such
               highlighting is not suitable for tasks where model
               decisions should be driven by more complex reasoning. In
               this work, we investigate the use of influence functions
               for NLP, providing an alternative approach to interpreting
               neural text classifiers. Influence functions explain the
               decisions of a model by identifying influential training
               examples. Despite the promise of this approach, influence
               functions have not yet been extensively evaluated in the
               context of NLP, a gap addressed by this work. We conduct a
               comparison between influence functions and common
               word-saliency methods on representative tasks. As
               suspected, we find that influence functions are
               particularly useful for natural language inference, a task
               in which {`}saliency maps{'} may not have clear
               interpretation. Furthermore, we develop a new quantitative
               measure based on influence functions that can reveal
               artifacts in training data.}

  abstract  = {Transfer learning with large pretrained transformer-based
               language models like BERT has become a dominating approach
               for most NLP tasks. Simply fine-tuning those large language
               models on downstream tasks or combining it with
               task-specific pretraining is often not robust. In
               particular, the performance considerably varies as the
               random seed changes or the number of pretraining and/or
               fine-tuning iterations varies, and the fine-tuned model is
               vulnerable to adversarial attack. We propose a simple yet
               effective adapter-based approach to mitigate these issues.
               Specifically, we insert small bottleneck layers (i.e.,
               adapter) within each layer of a pretrained model, then fix
               the pretrained layers and train the adapter layers on the
               downstream task data, with (1) task-specific unsupervised
               pretraining and then (2) task-specific supervised training
               (e.g., classification, sequence labeling). Our experiments
               demonstrate that such a training scheme leads to improved
               stability and adversarial robustness in transfer learning
               to various downstream tasks.}

  abstract  = {Unsupervised learning of syntactic structure is typically
               performed using generative models with discrete latent
               variables and multinomial parameters. In most cases, these
               models have not leveraged continuous word representations.
               In this work, we propose a novel generative model that
               jointly learns discrete syntactic structure and continuous
               word representations in an unsupervised fashion by
               cascading an invertible neural network with a structured
               generative prior. We show that the invertibility condition
               allows for efficient exact inference and marginal
               likelihood computation in our model so long as the prior is
               well-behaved. In experiments we instantiate our approach
               with both Markov and tree-structured priors, evaluating on
               two tasks: part-of-speech (POS) induction, and unsupervised
               dependency parsing without gold POS annotation. On the Penn
               Treebank, our Markov-structured model surpasses
               state-of-the-art results on POS induction. Similarly, we
               find that our tree-structured model achieves
               state-of-the-art performance on unsupervised dependency
               parsing for the difficult training condition where neither
               gold POS annotation nor punctuation-based constraints are
               available.}

  abstract  = {Recent work has improved our ability to detect linguistic
               knowledge in word representations. However, current methods
               for detecting syntactic knowledge do not test whether
               syntax trees are represented in their entirety. In this
               work, we propose a structural probe, which evaluates
               whether syntax trees are embedded in a linear
               transformation of a neural network{'}s word representation
               space. The probe identifies a linear transformation under
               which squared L2 distance encodes the distance between
               words in the parse tree, and one in which squared L2 norm
               encodes depth in the parse tree. Using our probe, we show
               that such transformations exist for both ELMo and BERT but
               not in baselines, providing evidence that entire syntax
               trees are embedded implicitly in deep models{'} vector
               geometry.}

  abstract  = {Merchants selling products on the Web often ask their
               customers to review the products that they have purchased
               and the associated services. As e-commerce is becoming more
               and more popular, the number of customer reviews that a
               product receives grows rapidly. For a popular product, the
               number of reviews can be in hundreds or even thousands.
               This makes it difficult for a potential customer to read
               them to make an informed decision on whether to purchase
               the product. It also makes it difficult for the
               manufacturer of the product to keep track and to manage
               customer opinions. For the manufacturer, there are
               additional difficulties because many merchant sites may
               sell the same product and the manufacturer normally
               produces many kinds of products. In this research, we aim
               to mine and to summarize all the customer reviews of a
               product. This summarization task is different from
               traditional text summarization because we only mine the
               features of the product on which the customers have
               expressed their opinions and whether the opinions are
               positive or negative. We do not summarize the reviews by
               selecting a subset or rewrite some of the original
               sentences from the reviews to capture the main points as in
               the classic text summarization. Our task is performed in
               three steps: (1) mining product features that have been
               commented on by customers; (2) identifying opinion
               sentences in each review and deciding whether each opinion
               sentence is positive or negative; (3) summarizing the
               results. This paper proposes several novel techniques to
               perform these tasks. Our experimental results using reviews
               of a number of products sold online demonstrate the
               effectiveness of the techniques.},

  abstract = {Recent work has presented intriguing results examining the
              knowledge contained in language models (LMs) by having the
              LM fill in the blanks of prompts such as {``}Obama is a
              {\_}{\_} by profession{''}. These prompts are usually
              manually created, and quite possibly sub-optimal; another
              prompt such as {``}Obama worked as a {\_}{\_} {''} may
              result in more accurately predicting the correct
              profession. Because of this, given an inappropriate prompt,
              we might fail to retrieve facts that the LM does know, and
              thus any given prompt only provides a lower bound estimate
              of the knowledge contained in an LM. In this paper, we
              attempt to more accurately estimate the knowledge contained
              in LMs by automatically discovering better prompts to use
              in this querying process. Specifically, we propose
              mining-based and paraphrasing-based methods to
              automatically generate high-quality and diverse prompts, as
              well as ensemble methods to combine answers from different
              prompts. Extensive experiments on the LAMA benchmark for
              extracting relational knowledge from LMs demonstrate that
              our methods can improve accuracy from 31.1{\%} to 39.6{\%},
              providing a tighter lower bound on what LMs know. We have
              released the code and the resulting LM Prompt And Query
              Archive (LPAQA) at https://github.com/jzbjyb/LPAQA.}

               distributional properties of large-scale corpora by
               minimizing the log loss. While straightforward to optimize,
               this approach forces the model to reproduce all variations
               in the dataset, including noisy and invalid references
               (e.g., misannotations and hallucinated facts). Even a small
               fraction of noisy data can degrade the performance of log
               loss. As an alternative, prior work has shown that
               minimizing the distinguishability of generated samples is a
               principled and robust loss that can handle invalid
               references. However, distinguishability has not been used
               in practice due to challenges in optimization and
               estimation. We propose loss truncation: a simple and
               scalable procedure which adaptively removes high log loss
               examples as a way to optimize for distinguishability.
               Empirically, we demonstrate that loss truncation
               outperforms existing baselines on distinguishability on a
               summarization task. Furthermore, we show that samples
               generated by the loss truncation model have factual
               accuracy ratings that exceed those of baselines and match
               human references.}

              billion-parameter conditional transformer language model,
              trained to condition on control codes that govern style,
              content, and task-specific behavior. Control codes were
              derived from structure that naturally co-occurs with raw
              text, preserving the advantages of unsupervised learning
              while providing more explicit control over text generation.
              These codes also allow CTRL to predict which parts of the
              training data are most likely given a sequence. This
              provides a potential method for analyzing large amounts of
              data via model-based source attribution. We have released

               or right-wing standpoint. If one is able to reliably
               compute this meta information, news articles may be
               automatically tagged, this way encouraging or discouraging
               readers to consume the text. It is an open question how
               successfully hyperpartisan news detection can be automated,
               and the goal of this SemEval task was to shed light on the
               state of the art. We developed new resources for this
               purpose, including a manually labeled dataset with 1,273
               articles, and a second dataset with 754,000 articles,
               labeled via distant supervision. The interest of the
               research community in our task exceeded all our
               expectations: The datasets were downloaded about 1,000
               times, 322 teams registered, of which 184 configured a
               virtual machine on our shared task cloud service TIRA, of
               which in turn 42 teams submitted a valid run. The best team
               achieved an accuracy of 0.822 on a balanced sample (yes :
               no hyperpartisan) drawn from the manually tagged corpus; an
               ensemble of the submitted systems increased the accuracy by
               0.048.}

  abstract  = {How can we explain the predictions of a black-box model?
               In this paper, we use influence functions — a classic
               technique from robust statistics — to trace a model’s
               prediction through the learning algorithm and back to its
               training data, thereby identifying training points most
               responsible for a given prediction. To scale up influence
               functions to modern machine learning settings, we develop a
               simple, efficient implementation that requires only oracle
               access to gradients and Hessian-vector products. We show
               that even on non-convex and non-differentiable models where
               the theory breaks down, approximations to influence
               functions can still provide valuable information. On linear
               models and convolutional neural networks, we demonstrate
               that influence functions are useful for multiple purposes:
               understanding model behavior, debugging models, detecting
               dataset errors, and even creating
               visually-indistinguishable training-set attacks.}

  abstract = {Class-conditional language models (CC-LMs) can be used to
              generate natural language with specific attributes, such as
              style or sentiment, by conditioning on an attribute label,
              or control code. However, we find that these models
              struggle to control generation when applied to
              out-of-domain prompts or unseen control codes. To overcome
              these limitations, we propose generative discriminator
              (GeDi) guided contrastive generation, which uses CC-LMs as
              generative discriminators (GeDis) to efficiently guide
              generation from a (potentially much larger) LM towards a
              desired attribute. In our human evaluation experiments, we
              show that GeDis trained for sentiment control on movie
              reviews are able to control the tone of book text. We also
              demonstrate that GeDis are able to detoxify generation and
              control topic while maintaining the same level of
              linguistic acceptability as direct generation from GPT-2
              (1.5B parameters). Lastly, we show that a GeDi trained on
              only 4 topics can generalize to new control codes from word
              embeddings, allowing it to guide generation towards wide
              array of topics.},

               neural models reveals that this highly scalable approach
               outperforms previous models, including those trained with
               strong supervision using datasets from related domains,
               such as natural language inference and fact checking.
               Additionally, human evaluation shows that the auxiliary
               span extraction tasks provide useful assistance in the
               process of verifying factual consistency. We also release a
               manually annotated dataset for factual consistency
               verification, code for training data generation, and
               trained model weights at
               https://github.com/salesforce/factCC.}

               systems still suffer from faithfulness errors. While prior
               work has proposed models that improve faithfulness, it is
               unclear whether the improvement comes from an increased
               level of extractiveness of the model outputs as one naive
               way to improve faithfulness is to make summarization models
               more extractive. In this work, we present a framework for
               evaluating the effective faithfulness of summarization
               systems, by generating a faithfulness-abstractiveness
               trade-off curve that serves as a control at different
               operating points on the abstractiveness spectrum. We then
               show that the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) baseline
               as well as recently proposed methods for improving
               faithfulness, fail to consistently improve over the control
               at the same level of abstractiveness. Finally, we learn a
               selector to identify the most faithful and abstractive
               summary for a given document, and show that this system can
               attain higher faithfulness scores in human evaluations
               while being more abstractive than the baseline system on
               two datasets. Moreover, we show that our system is able to
               achieve a better faithfulness-abstractiveness trade-off
               than the control at the same level of abstractiveness.}

  abstract  = {We present BART, a denoising autoencoder for pretraining
               sequence-to-sequence models. BART is trained by (1)
               corrupting text with an arbitrary noising function, and (2)
               learning a model to reconstruct the original text. It uses
               a standard Tranformer-based neural machine translation
               architecture which, despite its simplicity, can be seen as
               generalizing BERT (due to the bidirectional encoder), GPT
               (with the left-to-right decoder), and other recent
               pretraining schemes. We evaluate a number of noising
               approaches, finding the best performance by both randomly
               shuffling the order of sentences and using a novel
               in-filling scheme, where spans of text are replaced with a
               single mask token. BART is particularly effective when fine
               tuned for text generation but also works well for
               comprehension tasks. It matches the performance of RoBERTa
               on GLUE and SQuAD, and achieves new state-of-the-art
               results on a range of abstractive dialogue, question
               answering, and summarization tasks, with gains of up to 3.5
               ROUGE. BART also provides a 1.1 BLEU increase over a
               back-translation system for machine translation, with only
               target language pretraining. We also replicate other
               pretraining schemes within the BART framework, to
               understand their effect on end-task performance.}

  abstract  = {Contextual word representations derived from large-scale
               neural language models are successful across a diverse set
               of NLP tasks, suggesting that they encode useful and
               transferable features of language. To shed light on the
               linguistic knowledge they capture, we study the
               representations produced by several recent pretrained
               contextualizers (variants of ELMo, the OpenAI transformer
               language model, and BERT) with a suite of sixteen diverse
               probing tasks. We find that linear models trained on top of
               frozen contextual representations are competitive with
               state-of-the-art task-specific models in many cases, but
               fail on tasks requiring fine-grained linguistic knowledge
               (e.g., conjunct identification). To investigate the
               transferability of contextual word representations, we
               quantify differences in the transferability of individual
               layers within contextualizers, especially between recurrent
               neural networks (RNNs) and transformers. For instance,
               higher layers of RNNs are more task-specific, while
               transformer layers do not exhibit the same monotonic trend.
               In addition, to better understand what makes contextual
               word representations transferable, we compare language
               model pretraining with eleven supervised pretraining tasks.
               For any given task, pretraining on a closely related task
               yields better performance than language model pretraining
               (which is better on average) when the pretraining dataset
               is fixed. However, language model pretraining on more data
               gives the best results.}

  abstract  = {It is well known that the standard likelihood training and
               approximate decoding objectives in neural text generation
               models lead to less human-like responses for open-ended
               tasks such as language modeling and story generation. In
               this paper we have analyzed limitations of these models for
               abstractive document summarization and found that these
               models are highly prone to hallucinate content that is
               unfaithful to the input document. We conducted a large
               scale human evaluation of several neural abstractive
               summarization systems to better understand the types of
               hallucinations they produce. Our human annotators found
               substantial amounts of hallucinated content in all model
               generated summaries. However, our analysis does show that
               pretrained models are better summarizers not only in terms
               of raw metrics, i.e., ROUGE, but also in generating
               faithful and factual summaries as evaluated by humans.
               Furthermore, we show that textual entailment measures
               better correlate with faithfulness than standard metrics,
               potentially leading the way to automatic evaluation metrics
               as well as training and decoding criteria.}

               abstractive summarization models is that the generated
               summaries can be factually inconsistent with the input
               documents. The fact that automatic summarization may
               produce plausible-sounding yet inaccurate summaries is a
               major concern that limits its wide application. In this
               paper we present an approach to address factual consistency
               in summarization. We first propose an efficient automatic
               evaluation metric to measure factual consistency; next, we
               propose a novel learning algorithm that maximizes the
               proposed metric during model training. Through extensive
               experiments, we confirm that our method is effective in
               improving factual consistency and even overall quality of
               the summaries, as judged by both automatic metrics and
               human evaluation.}

  abstract  = {Modern summarization models generate highly fluent but
               often factually unreliable outputs. This motivated a surge
               of metrics attempting to measure the factuality of
               automatically generated summaries. Due to the lack of
               common benchmarks, these metrics cannot be compared.
               Moreover, all these methods treat factuality as a binary
               concept and fail to provide deeper insights on the kinds of
               inconsistencies made by different systems. To address these
               limitations, we devise a typology of factual errors and use
               it to collect human annotations of generated summaries from
               state-of-the-art summarization systems for the CNN/DM and
               XSum datasets. Through these annotations we identify the
               proportion of different categories of factual errors and
               benchmark factuality metrics, showing their correlation
               with human judgement as well as their specific strengths
               and weaknesses.}

  abstract  = {Contextual word representations derived from pre-trained
               bidirectional language models (biLMs) have recently been
               shown to provide significant improvements to the state of
               the art for a wide range of NLP tasks. However, many
               questions remain as to how and why these models are so
               effective. In this paper, we present a detailed empirical
               study of how the choice of neural architecture (e.g. LSTM,
               CNN, or self attention) influences both end task accuracy
               and qualitative properties of the representations that are
               learned. We show there is a tradeoff between speed and
               accuracy, but all architectures learn high quality
               contextual representations that outperform word embeddings
               for four challenging NLP tasks. Additionally, all
               architectures learn representations that vary with network
               depth, from exclusively morphological based at the word
               embedding layer through local syntax based in the lower
               contextual layers to longer range semantics such
               coreference at the upper layers. Together, these results
               suggest that unsupervised biLMs, independent of
               architecture, are learning much more about the structure of
               language than previously appreciated.}

  abstract  = {Recent progress in pretraining language models on large
               textual corpora led to a surge of improvements for
               downstream NLP tasks. Whilst learning linguistic knowledge,
               these models may also be storing relational knowledge
               present in the training data, and may be able to answer
               queries structured as {``}fill-in-the-blank{''} cloze
               statements. Language models have many advantages over
               structured knowledge bases: they require no schema
               engineering, allow practitioners to query about an open
               class of relations, are easy to extend to more data, and
               require no human supervision to train. We present an
               in-depth analysis of the relational knowledge already
               present (without fine-tuning) in a wide range of
               state-of-the-art pretrained language models. We find that
               (i) without fine-tuning, BERT contains relational knowledge
               competitive with traditional NLP methods that have some
               access to oracle knowledge, (ii) BERT also does remarkably
               well on open-domain question answering against a supervised
               baseline, and (iii) certain types of factual knowledge are
               learned much more readily than others by standard language
               model pretraining approaches. The surprisingly strong
               ability of these models to recall factual knowledge without
               any fine-tuning demonstrates their potential as
               unsupervised open-domain QA systems. The code to reproduce
               our analysis is available at
               https://github.com/facebookresearch/LAMA.}

  abstract = {We introduce DART, a large dataset for open-domain
              structured data record to text generation. We consider the
              structured data record input as a set of RDF
              entity-relation triples, a format widely used for knowledge
              representation and semantics description. DART consists of
              82,191 examples across different domains with each input
              being a semantic RDF triple set derived from data records
              in tables and the tree ontology of the schema, annotated
              with sentence descriptions that cover all facts in the
              triple set. This hierarchical, structured format with its
              open-domain nature differentiates DART from other existing
              table-to-text corpora. We conduct an analysis of DART on
              several state-of-the-art text generation models, showing
              that it introduces new and interesting challenges compared
              to existing datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
              finetuning pretrained language models on DART facilitates
              out-of-domain generalization on the WebNLG 2017 dataset.
              DART is available at https://github.com/Yale-LILY/dart.},

  abstract  = {Neural sequence-to-sequence models have provided a viable
               new approach for abstractive text summarization (meaning
               they are not restricted to simply selecting and rearranging
               passages from the original text). However, these models
               have two shortcomings: they are liable to reproduce factual
               details inaccurately, and they tend to repeat themselves.
               In this work we propose a novel architecture that augments
               the standard sequence-to-sequence attentional model in two
               orthogonal ways. First, we use a hybrid pointer-generator
               network that can copy words from the source text via
               pointing, which aids accurate reproduction of information,
               while retaining the ability to produce novel words through
               the generator. Second, we use coverage to keep track of
               what has been summarized, which discourages repetition. We
               apply our model to the CNN / Daily Mail summarization task,
               outperforming the current abstractive state-of-the-art by
               at least 2 ROUGE points.}

               two agents is a difficult task, especially in open-domain
               chit-chat style dialogue. There have been recent efforts to
               develop automatic dialogue evaluation metrics, but most of
               them do not generalize to unseen datasets and/or need a
               human-generated reference response during inference, making
               it infeasible for online evaluation. Here, we propose an
               unreferenced automated evaluation metric that uses large
               pre-trained language models to extract latent
               representations of utterances, and leverages the temporal
               transitions that exist between them. We show that our model
               achieves higher correlation with human annotations in an
               online setting, while not requiring true responses for
               comparison during inference.}

              processes of immigrant groups, while race scholars focus on
              structural barriers nonwhite immigrants face. By comparing
              nonwhite immigrants with native-born Americans, we can
              better understand how racial logics affect the
              identification of racial minorities in the United States.
              Drawing on 153 interviews with Indian, Caribbean, Chinese,
              Filipino, and Mexican immigrants, and comparing their
              narratives to those of black native-born respondents, the
              authors find similar understandings of American identity
              across immigrant groups as well as barriers to recognition
              as American shared by immigrants and native-born blacks.
              Immigrant narratives continue to reify the United States as
              a white nation, thus leading to their exclusion by default.

  abstract  = {We study the problem of attributing the prediction of a
               deep network to its input features, a problem previously
               studied by several other works. We identify two fundamental
               axioms— Sensitivity and Implementation Invariance that
               attribution methods ought to satisfy. We show that they are
               not satisfied by most known attribution methods, which we
               consider to be a fundamental weakness of those methods. We
               use the axioms to guide the design of a new attribution
               method called Integrated Gradients. Our method requires no
               modification to the original network and is extremely
               simple to implement; it just needs a few calls to the
               standard gradient operator. We apply this method to a
               couple of image models, a couple of text models and a
               chemistry model, demonstrating its ability to debug
               networks, to extract rules from a network, and to enable
               users to engage with models better.},

               of the art on many NLP tasks. We focus on one such model,
               BERT, and aim to quantify where linguistic information is
               captured within the network. We find that the model
               represents the steps of the traditional NLP pipeline in an
               interpretable and localizable way, and that the regions
               responsible for each step appear in the expected sequence:
               POS tagging, parsing, NER, semantic roles, then
               coreference. Qualitative analysis reveals that the model
               can and often does adjust this pipeline dynamically,
               revising lower-level decisions on the basis of
               disambiguating information from higher-level
               representations.}

              generate long and coherent pieces of text as dangerous,
              since they may be used in misinformation campaigns. Here we
              formulate large-scale language model output detection as a
              hypothesis testing problem to classify text as genuine or
              generated. We show that error exponents for particular
              language models are bounded in terms of their perplexity, a
              standard measure of language generation performance. Under
              the assumption that human language is stationary and
              ergodic, the formulation is extended from considering
              specific language models to considering maximum likelihood
              language models, among the class of k-order Markov
              approximations; error probabilities are characterized. Some
              discussion of incorporating semantic side information is
              also given.},

  abstract  = {To measure how well pretrained representations encode some
               linguistic property, it is common to use accuracy of a
               probe, i.e. a classifier trained to predict the property
               from the representations. Despite widespread adoption of
               probes, differences in their accuracy fail to adequately
               reflect differences in representations. For example, they
               do not substantially favour pretrained representations over
               randomly initialized ones. Analogously, their accuracy can
               be similar when probing for genuine linguistic labels and
               probing for random synthetic tasks. To see reasonable
               differences in accuracy with respect to these random
               baselines, previous work had to constrain either the amount
               of probe training data or its model size. Instead, we
               propose an alternative to the standard probes,
               information-theoretic probing with minimum description
               length (MDL). With MDL probing, training a probe to predict
               labels is recast as teaching it to effectively transmit the
               data. Therefore, the measure of interest changes from probe
               accuracy to the description length of labels given
               representations. In addition to probe quality, the
               description length evaluates {``}the amount of effort{''}
               needed to achieve the quality. This amount of effort
               characterizes either (i) size of a probing model, or (ii)
               the amount of data needed to achieve the high quality. We
               consider two methods for estimating MDL which can be easily
               implemented on top of the standard probing pipelines:
               variational coding and online coding. We show that these
               methods agree in results and are more informative and
               stable than the standard probes.}

               entity recognition, relation extraction, and event
               extraction. Our framework (called DyGIE++) accomplishes all
               tasks by enumerating, refining, and scoring text spans
               designed to capture local (within-sentence) and global
               (cross-sentence) context. Our framework achieves
               state-of-the-art results across all tasks, on four datasets
               from a variety of domains. We perform experiments comparing
               different techniques to construct span representations.
               Contextualized embeddings like BERT perform well at
               capturing relationships among entities in the same or
               adjacent sentences, while dynamic span graph updates model
               long-range cross-sentence relationships. For instance,
               propagating span representations via predicted coreference
               links can enable the model to disambiguate challenging
               entity mentions. Our code is publicly available at
               https://github.com/dwadden/dygiepp and can be easily

               \textit{probe} learns to solve specific linguistic tasks
               (e.g., dependency parsing) in a supervised manner using
               feature representations (e.g., contextualized embeddings).
               The effectiveness of such \textit{probing} tasks is taken
               as evidence that the pre-trained model encodes linguistic
               knowledge. However, this approach of evaluating a language
               model is undermined by the uncertainty of the amount of
               knowledge that is learned by the probe itself.
               Complementary to those works, we propose a parameter-free
               probing technique for analyzing pre-trained language models
               (e.g., BERT). Our method does not require direct
               supervision from the probing tasks, nor do we introduce
               additional parameters to the probing process. Our
               experiments on BERT show that syntactic trees recovered
               from BERT using our method are significantly better than
               linguistically-uninformed baselines. We further feed the
               empirically induced dependency structures into a downstream
               sentiment classification task and find its improvement
               compatible with or even superior to a human-designed
               dependency schema.}

  abstract = {In this paper, we focus on generating training examples
              for few-shot intents in the realistic imbalanced scenario.
              To build connections between existing many-shot intents and
              few-shot intents, we consider an intent as a combination of
              a domain and an action, and propose a composed variational
              natural language generator (CLANG), a transformer-based
              conditional variational autoencoder. CLANG utilizes two
              latent variables to represent the utterances corresponding
              to two different independent parts (domain and action) in
              the intent, and the latent variables are composed together
              to generate natural examples. Additionally, to improve the
              generator learning, we adopt the contrastive regularization
              loss that contrasts the in-class with the out-of-class
              utterance generation given the intent. To evaluate the
              quality of the generated utterances, experiments are
              conducted on the generalized few-shot intent detection
              task. Empirical results show that our proposed model
              achieves state-of-the-art performances on two real-world
              intent detection datasets.},

  abstract  = {Automatic evaluation metrics are a crucial component of
               dialog systems research. Standard language evaluation
               metrics are known to be ineffective for evaluating dialog.
               As such, recent research has proposed a number of novel,
               dialog-specific metrics that correlate better with human
               judgements. Due to the fast pace of research, many of these
               metrics have been assessed on different datasets and there
               has as yet been no time for a systematic comparison between
               them. To this end, this paper provides a comprehensive
               assessment of recently proposed dialog evaluation metrics
               on a number of datasets. In this paper, 23 different
               automatic evaluation metrics are evaluated on 10 different
               datasets. Furthermore, the metrics are assessed in
               different settings, to better qualify their respective
               strengths and weaknesses. This comprehensive assessment
               offers several takeaways pertaining to dialog evaluation
               metrics in general. It also suggests how to best assess
               evaluation metrics and indicates promising directions for
               future work.}

  abstract  = {In conversation, a general response (e.g., {``}I don{'}t
               know{''}) could correspond to a large variety of input
               utterances. Previous generative conversational models
               usually employ a single model to learn the relationship
               between different utterance-response pairs, thus tend to
               favor general and trivial responses which appear
               frequently. To address this problem, we propose a novel
               controlled response generation mechanism to handle
               different utterance-response relationships in terms of
               specificity. Specifically, we introduce an explicit
               specificity control variable into a sequence-to-sequence
               model, which interacts with the usage representation of
               words through a Gaussian Kernel layer, to guide the model
               to generate responses at different specificity levels. We
               describe two ways to acquire distant labels for the

  abstract  = {Recent work pre-training Transformers with self-supervised
               objectives on large text corpora has shown great success
               when fine-tuned on downstream NLP tasks including text
               summarization. However, pre-training objectives tailored
               for abstractive text summarization have not been explored.
               Furthermore there is a lack of systematic evaluation across
               diverse domains. In this work, we propose pre-training
               large Transformer-based encoder-decoder models on massive
               text corpora with a new self-supervised objective. In
               PEGASUS, important sentences are removed/masked from an
               input document and are generated together as one output
               sequence from the remaining sentences, similar to an
               extractive summary. We evaluated our best PEGASUS model on
               12 downstream summarization tasks spanning news, science,
               stories, instructions, emails, patents, and legislative
               bills. Experiments demonstrate it achieves state-of-the-art
               performance on all 12 downstream datasets measured by ROUGE
               scores. Our model also shows surprising performance on
               low-resource summarization, surpassing previous
               state-of-the-art results on 6 datasets with only 1000
               examples. Finally we validated our results using human
               evaluation and show that our model summaries achieve human
               performance on multiple datasets.}
