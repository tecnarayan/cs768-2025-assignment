address = {New York, NY, USA},
abstract = {Advanced database systems face a great challenge raised by the emergence of massive, complex structural data in bioinformatics, chem-informatics, and many other applications. The most fundamental support needed in these applications is the efficient search of complex structured data. Since exact matching is often too restrictive, similarity search of complex structures becomes a vital operation that must be supported efficiently.In this paper, we investigate the issues of substructure similarity search using indexed features in graph databases. By transforming the edge relaxation ratio of a query graph into the maximum allowed missing features, our structural filtering algorithm, called Grafil, can filter many graphs without performing pairwise similarity computations. It is further shown that using either too few or too many features can result in poor filtering performance. Thus the challenge is to design an effective feature set selection strategy for filtering. By examining the effect of different feature selection mechanisms, we develop a multi-filter composition strategy, where each filter uses a distinct and complementary subset of the features. We identify the criteria to form effective feature sets for filtering, and demonstrate that combining features with similar size and selectivity can improve the filtering and search performance significantly. Moreover, the concept presented in Grafil can be applied to searching approximate non-consecutive sequences, trees, and other complicated structures as well.},

isbn = {9781450306614},

abstract = {Complex social and information network search becomes important with a variety of applications. In the core of these applications, lies a common and critical problem: Given a labeled network and a query graph, how to efficiently search the query graph in the target network. The presence of noise and the incomplete knowledge about the structure and content of the target network make it unrealistic to find an exact match. Rather, it is more appealing to find the top-k approximate matches.In this paper, we propose a neighborhood-based similarity measure that could avoid costly graph isomorphism and edit distance computation. Under this new measure, we prove that subgraph similarity search is NP hard, while graph similarity match is polynomial. By studying the principles behind this measure, we found an information propagation model that is able to convert a large network into a set of multidimensional vectors, where sophisticated indexing and similarity search algorithms are available. The proposed method, called Ness (Neighborhood Based Similarity Search), is appropriate for graphs with low automorphism and high noise, which are common in many social and information networks. Ness is not only efficient, but also robust against structural noise and information loss. Empirical results show that it can quickly and accurately find high-quality matches in large networks, with negligible cost.},

abstract = {Subgraph matching finds all distinct isomorphic embeddings of a query graph on a data graph. For large graphs, current solutions face the scalability challenge due to expensive joins, excessive false candidates, and workload imbalance. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for subgraph listing based on Compact Embedding Cluster Index (idx), which divides the data graph into multiple embedding clusters for parallel processing. The sub has three unique techniques: utilizing the BFS-based filtering and reverse-BFS-based refinement to prune the unpromising candidates early on, replacing the edge verification with set intersection to speed up the candidate verification, and using search cardinality based cost estimation for detecting and dividing large embedding clusters in advance. The experiments performed on several real and synthetic datasets show that the sub outperforms state-of-the-art solutions on average by 20.4\texttimes{} for listing all embeddings and by 2.6\texttimes{} for enumerating the first 1,024 embeddings.},
