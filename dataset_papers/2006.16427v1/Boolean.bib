	abstract = {Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is an important algorithm in machine learning. With constant learning rates, it is a stochastic process that, after an initial phase of convergence, generates samples from a stationary distribution. We show that SGD with constant rates can be effectively used as an approximate posterior inference algorithm for probabilistic modeling. Specifically, we show how to adjust the tuning parameters of SGD such as to match the resulting stationary distribution to the posterior. This analysis rests on interpreting SGD as a continuous-time stochastic process and then minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between its stationary distribution and the target posterior. (This is in the spirit of variational inference.) In more detail, we model SGD as a multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and then use properties of this process to derive the optimal parameters. This theoretical framework also connects SGD to modern scalable inference algorithms; we analyze the recently proposed stochastic gradient Fisher scoring under this perspective. We demonstrate that SGD with properly chosen constant rates gives a new way to optimize hyperparameters in probabilistic models.},

	abstract = {The stochastic gradient descent method and its variants are algorithms of choice for many Deep Learning tasks. These methods operate in a small-batch regime wherein a fraction of the training data, usually \$32\$--\$512\$ data points, is sampled to compute an approximation to the gradient. It has been observed in practice that when using a larger batch there is a significant degradation in the quality of the model, as measured by its ability to generalize. There have been some attempts to investigate the cause for this generalization drop in the large-batch regime, however the precise answer for this phenomenon is, hitherto unknown. In this paper, we present ample numerical evidence that supports the view that large-batch methods tend to converge to sharp minimizers of the training and testing functions -- and that sharp minima lead to poorer generalization. In contrast, small-batch methods consistently converge to flat minimizers, and our experiments support a commonly held view that this is due to the inherent noise in the gradient estimation. We also discuss several empirical strategies that help large-batch methods eliminate the generalization gap and conclude with a set of future research ideas and open questions.},

@article{Adami2000,
abstract = {In order to make a case for or against a trend in the evolution of complexity in biological evolution, complexity needs to be both rigorously defined and measurable. A recent information-theoretic (but intuitively evident) definition identifies genomic complexity with the amount of information a sequence stores about its environment. We investigate the evolution of genomic complexity in populations of digital organisms and monitor in detail the evolutionary transitions that increase complexity. We show that because natural selection forces genomes to behave as a natural ``Maxwell Demon'', within a fixed environment genomic complexity is forced to increase.},

abstract = {Perceptual learning can be defined as practice-induced improvement in the ability to perform specific perceptual tasks. We previously proposed the Reverse Hierarchy Theory as a unifying concept that links behavioral findings of visual learning with physiological and anatomical data. Essentially, it asserts that learning is a top-down guided process, which begins at high-level areas of the visual system, and when these do not suffice, progresses backwards to the input levels, which have a better signal-to-noise ratio. This simple concept has proved powerful in explaining a broad range of findings, including seemingly contradicting data. We now extend this concept to describe the dynamics of skill acquisition and interpret recent behavioral and electrophysiological findings.},

@article{BarM1999,
abstract = {Humans often evidence little difficulty at recognizing objects from arbitrary orientations in depth. According to one class of theories, this competence is based on generalization from templates specified by metric properties (MPs), that were learned for the various orientations. An alternative class of theories assumes that non-accidental properties (NAPs) might be exploited so that even novel objects can be recognized under depth rotation. After scaling MP and NAP differences so that they were equally detectable when the objects were at the same orientation in depth, the present investigation assessed the effects of rotation on same-different judgments for matching novel objects. Judgments of a sequential pair of images of novel objects, when rendered from different viewpoints, revealed relatively low costs when the objects differed in a NAP of a single part, i.e. a geon. However, rotation dramatically reduced the detectability of MP differences to a level well below that expected by chance. NAPs offer a striking advantage over MPs for object classification and are therefore more likely to play a central role in the representation of objects.},

abstract = {Visual backward masking not only is an empirically rich and theoretically interesting phenomenon but also has found increasing application as a powerful methodological tool in studies of visual information processing and as a useful instrument for investigating visual function in a variety of specific subject populations. Since the dual-channel, sustained-transient approach to visual masking was introduced about two decades ago, several new models of backward masking and metacontrast have been proposed as alternative approaches to visual masking. In this article, we outline, review, and evaluate three such approaches: an extension of the dual-channel approach as realized in the neural network model of retino-cortical dynamics (Ogmen, 1993), the perceptual retouch theory (Bachmann, 1984, 1994), and the boundary contour system (Francis, 1997; Grossberg \& Mingolla, 1985b). Recent psychophysical and electrophysiological findings relevant to backward masking are reviewed and, whenever possible, are related to the aforementioned models. Besides noting the positive aspects of these models, we also list their problems and suggest changes that may improve them and experiments that can empirically test them.},

abstract = {In the theoretical framework of this paper, attention is part of the inference process that solves the visual recognition problem of what is where. The theory proposes a computational role for attention and leads to a model that predicts some of its main properties at the level of psychophysics and physiology. In our approach, the main goal of the visual system is to infer the identity and the position of objects in visual scenes: spatial attention emerges as a strategy to reduce the uncertainty in shape information while feature-based attention reduces the uncertainty in spatial information. Featural and spatial attention represent two distinct modes of a computational process solving the problem of recognizing and localizing objects, especially in difficult recognition tasks such as in cluttered natural scenes. We describe a specific computational model and relate it to the known functional anatomy of attention. We show that several well-known attentional phenomena – including bottom-up pop-out effects, multiplicative modulation of neuronal tuning curves and shift in contrast responses – all emerge naturally as predictions of the model. We also show that the Bayesian model predicts well human eye fixations (considered as a proxy for shifts of attention) in natural scenes.},

abstract = {Summary
Three classes of perceptual phenomena have repeatedly been associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD): superior processing of fine detail (local structure), either inferior processing of overall/global structure or an ability to ignore disruptive global/contextual information, and impaired motion perception. This review evaluates the quality of the evidence bearing on these three phenomena. We argue that while superior local processing has been robustly demonstrated, conclusions about global processing cannot be definitively drawn from the experiments to date, which have generally not precluded observers using more local cues. Perception of moving stimuli is impaired in ASD, but explanations in terms of magnocellular/dorsal deficits do not appear to be sufficient. We suggest that abnormalities in the superior temporal sulcus (STS) may provide a neural basis for the range of motion-processing deficits observed in ASD, including biological motion perception. Such an explanation may also provide a link between perceptual abnormalities and specific deficits in social cognition associated with autism.},

The neural code for written words must be abstract, because we can recognize words regardless of their location, font and size. Yet it must also be exquisitely sensitive to letter identity and letter order. Most existing coding schemes are insufficiently invariant or incompatible with the constraints of the visual system. We propose a tentative neuronal model according to which part of the occipito-temporal 'what' pathway is tuned to writing and forms a hierarchy of local combination detectors sensitive to increasingly larger fragments of words. Our proposal can explain why the detection of 'open bigrams' (ordered pairs of letters) constitutes an important stage in visual word recognition.},

abstract = {After more than a century of research, the mechanisms underlying visual masking are still hotly debated. One key characteristic of masking is that variations in the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) between the target and the mask can lead to either monotonic reductions in the effect of the mask on the target (A-type masking) or an increase in masking for intermediate SOAs and then a decrease in masking for longer SOAs (B-type masking). Past experimental and theoretical work suggested that the type of the masking function depends on the strength of the mask relative to the target. Usually, mask strength is related to energy (stimulus intensity × duration). Here, we show that the overall spatial layout of the mask is a much stronger factor than classical energy to explain the type of masking function.},

The extraction process proceeds in a top-down manner: informative top-level fragments are extracted first, and by a repeated application of the same feature extraction process the classification fragments are broken down successively into their own optimal components. The hierarchical decomposition terminates with atomic features that cannot be usefully decomposed into simpler features. The entire hierarchy, the different features and sub-features, and their optimal parameters, are learned during a training phase using training examples. Experimental comparisons show that these feature hierarchies are significantly more informative and better for classification compared with similar nonhierarchical features as well as previous methods for using feature hierarchies.},

These are local features which are not informative by themselves, and can only be detected reliably at locations specified relative to other features. This makes satellite features difficult to extract by current classification methods. We describe a novel scheme which can extract discriminative satellite features and use them to distinguish between visually similar classes. The algorithm first searches for a set of features ("anchor features") that can be found in all the similar classes. Such features can be detected because the classes are visually similar. The anchors are used to determine the locations of satellite features, which are extracted during learning and used in classification to distinguish between the similar classes. The algorithm is fully automatic, and is shown to work well for many categories of visually similar classes.},

abstract = {A neural network model for a mechanism of visual pattern recognition is proposed in this paper. The network is self-organized by “learning without a teacher”, and acquires an ability to recognize stimulus patterns based on the geometrical similarity (Gestalt) of their shapes without affected by their positions. This network is given a nickname “neocognitron”. After completion of self-organization, the network has a structure similar to the hierarchy model of the visual nervous system proposed by Hubel and Wiesel. The network consits of an input layer (photoreceptor array) followed by a cascade connection of a number of modular structures, each of which is composed of two layers of cells connected in a cascade. The first layer of each module consists of “S-cells”, which show characteristics similar to simple cells or lower order hypercomplex cells, and the second layer consists of “C-cells” similar to complex cells or higher order hypercomplex cells. The afferent synapses to each S-cell have plasticity and are modifiable. The network has an ability of unsupervised learning: We do not need any “teacher” during the process of self-organization, and it is only needed to present a set of stimulus patterns repeatedly to the input layer of the network. The network has been simulated on a digital computer. After repetitive presentation of a set of stimulus patterns, each stimulus pattern has become to elicit an output only from one of the C-cell of the last layer, and conversely, this C-cell has become selectively responsive only to that stimulus pattern. That is, none of the C-cells of the last layer responds to more than one stimulus pattern. The response of the C-cells of the last layer is not affected by the pattern's position at all. Neither is it affected by a small change in shape nor in size of the stimulus pattern.},

abstract = {Stable multiday recordings from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of 2 monkeys performing 2 Go/NoGo visual-discrimination tasks (one requiring well-learned responses, the other requiring learning) demonstrate that the majority of prefrontal neurons were "functionally stable". Recordings were made using a series of removable microdrives, each implanted for 3-6 mo, housing independently mobile electrodes. Action potential waveforms of 94 neurons were stable over 2-9 days; 66/94 (70\%) of these cells responded each day, 22/94 (23\%) never responded significantly, and 6/94 (6\%) responded one day but not the next. Of 66 responsive neurons, 55 were selective for either Go or NoGo trials, individual stimuli, or eye movements. This selectivity was functionally stable (i.e., maintained) for 46/55 neurons across all recording days. Functional stability was also noted in terms of response strength (baseline firing rates compared with poststimulation firing rates) and event-related response timing. Two neurons with consistent responses in familiar testing conditions responded flexibly when the monkeys learned to make correct responses to novel stimuli. We conclude that the majority of prefrontal neurons were functionally stable during the performance of well-learned tasks. Such stability may be a general property of prefrontal neurons, given that neurons with 4 different types of task selectivity were found to be functionally stable. Conceptually similar studies based on long-term recordings in other cortical regions reached similar conclusions, suggesting that neurons throughout the brain are functionally stable.},

abstract = {We extend previous work by modeling evolution of communication using a spatialized genetic algorithm which recombines strategies purely locally. Here cellular automata are used as a spatialized environment in which individuals gain points by feeding from drifting food sources and are ‘harmed’ if they fail to hide from migrating predators. Our individuals are capable of making one of two arbitrary sounds, heard only locally by their immediate neighbors. They can respond to sounds from their neighbors by opening their mouths or by hiding. By opening their mouths in the presence of food they maximize gains; by hiding when a predator is present they minimize losses. We consider the result a ‘natural’ template for benefits from communication; unlike a range of other studies, it is here only the recipient of communicated information that immediately benefits. A community of ‘perfect communicators’ could be expected to make a particular sound when successfully feeding, responding to that same sound from their neighbors by opening their mouths. They could be expected to make a different sound when ‘hurt’ and respond to that second sound from their neighbors by hiding. Suppose one starts from a small set of ‘Adam and Eve’ strategies randomized across a cellular automata array, and uses a genetic algorithm which operates purely locally by cross-breeding strategies with their most successful neighbors. Can one, in such an environment, expect evolution of local communities of ‘perfect communicators’? With some important qualifications, the answer is ‘yes’.},

abstract = {The present study investigated how attention to global or local levels of hierarchical patterns modulates brain activities by recording high-density event-related brain potentials (ERPs) evoked by hierarchical stimuli. 120-channel recordings of ERPs were obtained from subjects while they detected targets at global or local levels of hierarchical stimuli displayed in the left or the right visual field. We found that attention to local stimulus features enhanced posterior PI and N2 components, with the N2 enhancement showing a left hemisphere predominance regardless of stimulus positions. Difference was also seen in the distribution of the frontal P2. Reaction times were slowed when global and local levels of stimuli were incompatible, and an interference effect was observed on anterior N2 amplitudes and latencies. Three-dimensional current distributions showed common sources over the posterior cortex between 80-230 ms and a contralateral frontal source between 300-400 ms for global and local conditions. However, an additional ipsilateral frontal focus between 230-350 ms was found specially for local processing. The results corroborate the findings of previous ERP studies, and suggest that the frontal lobe is particularly important for the selective processing of local parts of a global structure.},

It has the attractive property that it side-steps the need to specify the costs of the different kinds of misclassification. However, the simple form is only applicable to the case of two classes. We extend the definition to the case of more than two classes by averaging pairwise comparisons. This measure reduces to the standard form in the two class case. We compare its properties with the standard measure of proportion correct and an alternative definition of proportion correct based on pairwise comparison of classes for a simple artificial case and illustrate its application on eight data sets. On the data sets we examined, the measures produced similar, but not identical results, reflecting the different aspects of performance that they were measuring. Like the area under the ROC curve, the measure we propose is useful in those many situations where it is impossible to give costs for the different kinds of misclassification.},

abstract = {Face perception, perhaps the most highly developed visual skill in humans, is mediated by a distributed neural system in humans that is comprised of multiple, bilateral regions. We propose a model for the organization of this system that emphasizes a distinction between the representation of invariant and changeable aspects of faces. The representation of invariant aspects of faces underlies the recognition of individuals, whereas the representation of changeable aspects of faces, such as eye gaze, expression, and lip movement, underlies the perception of information that facilitates social communication. The model is also hierarchical insofar as it is divided into a core system and an extended system. The core system is comprised of occipitotemporal regions in extrastriate visual cortex that mediate the visual analysis of faces. In the core system, the representation of invariant aspects is mediated more by the face-responsive region in the fusiform gyrus, whereas the representation of changeable aspects is mediated more by the face-responsive region in the superior temporal sulcus. The extended system is comprised of regions from neural systems for other cognitive functions that can be recruited to act in concert with the regions in the core system to extract meaning from faces.},

abstract = {Neurons and neural populations do not function as islands onto themselves. Rather, they interact with other such elements through their afferent and efferent connections in an orchestrated manner so as to enable different sensorimotor and cognitive tasks to be performed. The concept of functional connectivity and the allied notion of effective connectivity were introduced to designate the functional strengths of such interactions. Functional neuroimaging methods, especially PET and fMRI, have been used extensively to evaluate the functional connectivity between different brain regions. After providing a brief historical review of these notions of brain connectivity, I argue that the conceptual formulations of functional and effective connectivity are far from clear. Specifically, the terms functional and effective connectivity are applied to quantities computed on types of functional imaging data (e.g., PET, fMRI, EEG) that vary in spatial, temporal, and other features, using different definitions (even for data of the same modality) and employing different computational algorithms. Until it is understood what each definition means in terms of an underlying neural substrate, comparisons of functional and/or effective connectivity across studies may appear inconsistent and should be performed with great caution.},

We used a biologically plausible, classifier-based readout technique to investigate the neural coding of selectivity and invariance at the IT population level. The activity of small neuronal populations ([\~{}]100 randomly selected cells) over very short time intervals (as small as 12.5 milliseconds) contained unexpectedly accurate and robust information about both object "identity" and "category." This information generalized over a range of object positions and scales, even for novel objects. Coarse information about position and scale could also be read out from the same population.},

abstract = {Identifying a facial feature (e.g. the eyes) is influenced by the position and identity of other features (e.g. the mouth) of the face, supporting the view that an individual face is represented as a whole in the human brain. To clarify how early in the time-course of face processing this holistic individual representation is accessed we recorded event-related potentials during an adaptation paradigm of the composite face illusion (CFI). Observers performed a matching task on top halves of two faces presented sequentially. For each face pair, top and bottom face halves could be both identical, both different, or only the bottom half differed. The signal was larger over the right occipito-temporal cortex at about 160 ms (N170) when the attended top half differed between the two faces than when identical top halves were repeated. Crucially, a larger N170 was also found when the top halves of the two faces were the same, yet the observers had the illusion that they differed (CFI). This effect was not found when the two face halves were spatially misaligned. These observations indicate that the earliest perceptual representation of an individual face in the human brain is holistic rather than based on independent face parts.},

abstract = {The analysis of object shape is critical for both object recognition and grasping. Areas in the intraparietal sulcus of the rhesus monkey are important for the visuomotor transformations underlying actions directed toward objects. The lateral intraparietal (LIP) area has strong anatomical connections with the anterior intraparietal area, which is known to control the shaping of the hand during grasping, and LIP neurons can respond selectively to simple two-dimensional shapes. Here we investigate the shape representation in area LIP of awake rhesus monkeys. Specifically, we determined to what extent LIP neurons are tuned to shape dimensions known to be relevant for grasping and assessed the invariance of their shape preferences with regard to changes in stimulus size and position in the receptive field. Most LIP neurons proved to be significantly tuned to multiple shape dimensions. The population of LIP neurons that were tested showed barely significant size invariance. Position invariance was present in a minority of the neurons tested. Many LIP neurons displayed spurious shape selectivity arising from accidental interactions between the stimulus and the receptive field. We observed pronounced differences in the receptive field profiles determined by presenting two different shapes. Almost all LIP neurons showed spatially selective saccadic activity, but the receptive field for saccades did not always correspond to the receptive field as determined using shapes. Our results demonstrate that a subpopulation of LIP neurons encodes stimulus shape. Furthermore, the shape representation in the dorsal visual stream appears to differ radically from the known representation of shape in the ventral visual stream.},

While neurophysiology experiments have provided evidence for a "simple-to-complex" processing model based on a hierarchy of increasingly complex image features, behavioral and fMRI studies of face processing have been interpreted as incompatible with this account. We present a neurophysiologically plausible, feature-based model that quantitatively accounts for face discrimination characteristics, including face inversion and "configural" effects. The model predicts that face discrimination is based on a sparse representation of units selective for face shapes, without the need to postulate additional, "face-specific" mechanisms. We derive and test predictions that quantitatively link model FFA face neuron tuning, neural adaptation measured in an fMRI rapid adaptation paradigm, and face discrimination performance. The experimental data are in excellent agreement with the model prediction that discrimination performance should asymptote as faces become dissimilar enough to activate different neuronal populations.},

abstract = {The classification behaviour of human observers with respect to compound Gabor signals is tested at foveal and extrafoveal retinal positions. Classification performance is analysed in terms of a probabilistic classification model recently proposed by Rentschler, J\"{u}ttner and Caelli [(1994)Vision Research, 34, 669-687]. The analysis allows inferences about structure and dimensionality of the individual internal representations underlying the classification task and their temporal evolution during the learning process. Using this technique it is found that the internal representations of direct and eccentric viewing are intrinsically incommensurable, in the sense that extrafoveal pattern representations are characterized by a lower perceptual dimension in feature space relative to the corresponding physical input signals, whereas foveal representations are not. The observed deficits cannot be renormalized by size scaling (cortical magnification); however, they can be partially reduced by learning although the learning progress strongly depends on the observer's practice. The structural incommensurability between foveal and extrafoveal representations poses constraints on possible forms of foveal-extrafoveal interaction, which might have implications on related perceptual phenomena such as visual stability across saccadic eye movements.},

Thresholds for each submodality were identified by four-alternative-forced-choice tasks. Fast perceptual learning occurred for shape detection-based on luminance, motion and color differences but not for texture differences. In contradistinction, fast perceptual learning was not evident in shape localisation based on discrimination. Thresholds of all submodalities were stable across days.

While there is sensitivity to position in high-level object-selective cortex, position and object identity are thought to be encoded independently in the population response such that position information is available across objects and object information is available across positions. Contrary to this view, we show, with both behavior and neuroimaging, that visual object representations are position-dependent (tied to limited portions of the visual field). Behaviorally, we show that the effect of priming an object was greatly reduced with any change in position (within- or between-hemifields), indicating nonoverlapping representations of the same object across different positions. Furthermore, using neuroimaging, we show that object-selective cortex is not only highly sensitive to object position but also the ability to differentiate objects based on its response is greatly reduced across different positions, consistent with the observed behavior and the receptive field properties observed in macaque object-selective neurons. Thus, even at the population level, the object information available in response of object-selective cortex is constrained by position. We conclude that even high-level visual object representations are position-dependent.},

LFP responses in IT to complex objects showed strong selectivity at 44\% of the sites and tolerance to retinal position and size. The LFP preferences were poorly predicted by the spike preferences at the same site but were better explained by averaging spikes within approximately 3 mm. A comparison of separate sites suggests that selectivity is similar on a scale of approximately 800 microm for spikes and approximately 5 mm for LFPs. These observations imply that inputs to IT neurons convey selectivity for complex shapes and that such input may have an underlying organization spanning several millimeters.},

abstract = {Learning visual models of object categories notoriously requires hundreds or thousands of training examples. We show that it is possible to learn much information about a category from just one, or a handful, of images. The key insight is that, rather than learning from scratch, one can take advantage of knowledge coming from previously learned categories, no matter how different these categories might be. We explore a Bayesian implementation of this idea. Object categories are represented by probabilistic models. Prior knowledge is represented as a probability density function on the parameters of these models. The posterior model for an object category is obtained by updating the prior in the light of one or more observations. We test a simple implementation of our algorithm on a database of 101 diverse object categories. We compare category models learned by an implementation of our Bayesian approach to models learned from by maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum a posteriori (MAP) methods. We find that on a database of more than 100 categories, the Bayesian approach produces informative models when the number of training examples is too small for other methods to operate successfully.},

abstract = {We easily recognize objects and faces across a myriad of retinal images produced by each object. One hypothesis is that this tolerance (a.k.a. invariance) is learned by relying on the fact that object identities are temporally stable. While we previously found neuronal evidence supporting this idea at the top of the nonhuman primate ventral visual stream (inferior temporal cortex, or IT), we here test if this is a general tolerance learning mechanism. First, we found that the same type of unsupervised experience that reshaped IT position tolerance also predictably reshaped IT size tolerance, and the magnitude of reshaping was quantitatively similar. Second, this tolerance reshaping can be induced under naturally occurring dynamic visual experience, even without eye movements. Third, unsupervised temporal contiguous experience can build new neuronal tolerance. These results suggest that the ventral visual stream uses a general unsupervised tolerance learning algorithm to build its invariant object representation.  Unsupervised experience with temporally contiguous images reshapes IT size tolerance.  This tolerance learning takes place under natural vision conditions. The learning can build new IT tolerance, dictated by the experience provided.  The temporal asymmetry of the learning suggests a Hebbian-like mechanism

Responses of neurons from the inferior temporal cortex (IT) are selective to different objects, yet tolerant ("invariant") to changes in object position, scale, and pose. How does the brain construct this neuronal tolerance? We report a form of neuronal learning that suggests the underlying solution. Targeted alteration of the natural temporal contiguity of visual experience caused specific changes in IT position tolerance. This unsupervised temporal slowness learning (UTL) was substantial, increased with experience, and was significant in single IT neurons after just 1 hour. Together with previous theoretical work and human object perception experiments, we speculate that UTL may reflect the mechanism by which the visual stream builds and maintains tolerant object representations.},

Instead of attempting to model the entire ERP waveform, the method relies on modeling ERP component descriptors (amplitude and latency) thru the spatial diversity of multichannel recordings, and thus, it is tailored to extract signals in negative SNR conditions. The model allows for both amplitude and latency variability in the ERP component under investigation. The extracted ERP component is constrained through a spatial filter to have minimal distance (with respect to some metric) in the temporal domain from a user-designed template component. The spatial filter may be interpreted as a noise canceller in the spatial domain. Study with both simulated data and real cognitive ERP data shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

abstract = {This article provides a new, more comprehensive view of event-related brain dynamics founded on an information-based approach to modeling electroencephalographic (EEG) dynamics. Most EEG research focuses either on peaks 'evoked' in average event-related potentials (ERPs) or on changes 'induced' in the EEG power spectrum by experimental events. Although these measures are nearly complementary, they do not fully model the event-related dynamics in the data, and cannot isolate the signals of the contributing cortical areas. We propose that many ERPs and other EEG features are better viewed as time/frequency perturbations of underlying field potential processes. The new approach combines independent component analysis (ICA), time/frequency analysis, and trial-by-trial visualization that measures EEG source dynamics without requiring an explicit head model.},

@article{Mel1997,
abstract = {Severe architectural and timing constraints within the primate visual system support the conjecture that the early phase of object recognition in the brain is based on a feedforward feature-extraction hierarchy. To assess the plausibility of this conjecture in an engineering context, a difficult three-dimensional object recognition domain was developed to challenge a pure feedforward, receptive-field based recognition model called SEEMORE. SEEMORE is based on 102 viewpoint-invariant nonlinear filters that as a group are sensitive to contour, texture, and color cues. The visual domain consists of 100 real objects of many different types, including rigid (shovel), nonrigid (telephone cord), and statistical (maple leaf cluster) objects and photographs of complex scenes. Objects were in dividually presented in color video images under normal room lighting conditions. Based on 12 to 36 training views, SEEMORE was required to recognize unnormalized test views of objects that could vary in position, orientation in the image plane and in depth, and scale (factor of 2); for non rigid objects, recognition was also tested under gross shape deformations. Correct classification performance on a test set consisting of 600 novel object views was 97 percent (chance was 1 percent) and was comparable for the subset of 15 nonrigid objects. Performance was also measured under a variety of image degradation conditions, including partial occlusion, limited clutter, color shift, and additive noise. Generalization behavior and classification errors illustrate the emergence of several striking natural shape categories that are not explicitly encoded in the dimensions of the feature space. It is concluded that in the light of the vast hardware resources available in the ventral stream of the primate visual system relative to those exercised here, the appealingly simple feature-space conjecture remains worthy of serious consideration as a neurobiological model.},

@article{Nazir1990,
abstract = {Four experiments were conducted to study the nature of visual translation invariance in humans. In all the experiments, subjects were trained to discriminate between a previously unknown target and two non-target distractors presented at a fixed retinal location to one side of the fixation point. In a subsequent test phase, this performance was compared with the performance when the patterns were presented either centrally at the fixation point or at a location on the other side of the fixation point, opposite to the location where the patterns were learned, but where acuity was identical to what it was at the learned location. Two different experimental paradigms were used. One used an eye movement control device (Experiment 1) to ensure the eye could not move relative to the patterns to be learned. In the other three experiments, presentation duration of the patterns was restricted to a short enough period to preclude eye movements. During the training period in Experiments 1 and 2, presentation location of the patterns was centered at 2.4 deg in the periphery, whereas in Experiments 3 and 4 presentation eccentricity was reduced to 0.86 and 0.49 deg. In all four experiments performance dropped when the pattern had to be recognized at new test positions. This result suggests that the visual system does not apply a global transposition transformation to the retinal image to compensate for translations. We propose that, instead, it decomposes the image into simple features which themselves are more-or-less translation invariant. If in a given task, patterns can be discriminated using these simple features, then translation invariance will occur. If not, then translation invariance will fail or be incomplete.},

@article{Palmer2000,
abstract = {Most theories of visual search emphasize issues of limited versus unlimited capacity and serial versus parallel processing. In the present article, we suggest a broader framework based on two principles, one empirical and one theoretical. The empirical principle is to focus on conditions at the intersection of visual search and the simple detection and discrimination paradigms of spatial vision. Such simple search conditions avoid artifacts and phenomena specific to more complex stimuli and tasks. The theoretical principle is to focus on the distinction between high and low threshold theory. While high threshold theory is largely discredited for simple detection and discrimination, it persists in the search literature. Furthermore, a low threshold theory such as signal detection theory can account for some of the phenomena attributed to limited capacity or serial processing. In the body of this article, we compare the predictions of high threshold theory and three versions of signal detection theory to the observed effects of manipulating set size, discriminability, number of targets, response bias, external noise, and distractor heterogeneity. For almost all cases, the results are inconsistent with high threshold theory and are consistent with all three versions of signal detection theory. In the Discussion, these simple theories are generalized to a larger domain that includes search asymmetry, multidimensional judgements including conjunction search, response time, search with multiple eye fixations and more general stimulus conditions. We conclude that low threshold theories can account for simple visual search without invoking mechanisms such as limited capacity or serial processing.},

abstract = {We introduce a new general framework for the recognition of complex visual scenes, which is motivated by biology: We describe a hierarchical system that closely follows the organization of visual cortex and builds an increasingly complex and invariant feature representation by alternating between a template matching and a maximum pooling operation. We demonstrate the strength of the approach on a range of recognition tasks: From invariant single object recognition in clutter to multiclass categorization problems and complex scene understanding tasks that rely on the recognition of both shape-based as well as texture-based objects. Given the biological constraints that the system had to satisfy, the approach performs surprisingly well: It has the capability of learning from only a few training examples and competes with state-of-the-art systems. We also discuss the existence of a universal, redundant dictionary of features that could handle the recognition of most object categories. In addition to its relevance for computer vision, the success of this approach suggests a plausibility proof for a class of feedforward models of object recognition in cortex.},

abstract = {Primates are remarkably good at recognizing objects. The level of performance of their visual system and its robustness to image degradations still surpasses the best computer vision systems despite decades of engineering effort. In particular, the high accuracy of primates in ultra rapid object categorization and rapid serial visual presentation tasks is remarkable. Given the number of processing stages involved and typical neural latencies, such rapid visual processing is likely to be mostly feedforward. Here we show that a specific implementation of a class of feedforward theories of object recognition (that extend the Hubel and Wiesel simple-to-complex cell hierarchy and account for many anatomical and physiological constraints) can predict the level and the pattern of performance achieved by humans on a rapid masked animal vs. non-animal categorization task.},

abstract = {Models of object recognition in cortex have so far been mostly applied to tasks involving the recognition of isolated objects presented on blank backgrounds. However, ultimately models of the visual system have to prove themselves in real world object recognition tasks. Here we took a first step in this direction: We investigated the performance of the HMAX model of object recognition in cortex recently presented by Riesenhuber \& Poggio [1],[2] on the task of face detection using natural images. We found that the standard version of hmax performs rather poorly on this task, due to the low specificity of the hardwired feature set of C2 units in the model (corresponding to neurons in intermediate visual area V4) that do not show any particular tuning for faces vs. background. We show how visual features of intermediate complexity can be learned in HMAX using a simple learning rule. Using this rule, hmax outperforms a classical machine vision face detection system presented in the literature. This suggests an important role for the set of features in intermediate visual areas in object recognition.},

Our approach is predicated on the assumption that each image is generated by a sparse set of visual “causes” and that images which are visually similar share causes. We propose a mechanism for computing a very large number of highly selective features which capture some aspects of this causal structure (in our implementation there are over 46,000 highly selective features). At query time a user selects a few example images, and the AdaBoost algorithm is used to learn a classification function which depends on a small number of the most appropriate features. This yields a highly efficient classification function. In addition we show that the AdaBoost framework provides a natural mechanism for the incorporation of relevance feedback. Finally we show results on a wide variety of image queries.},

abstract = {A fundamental capacity of the perceptual systems and the brain in general is to deal with the novel and the unexpected. In vision, we can effortlessly recognize a familiar object under novel viewing conditions, or recognize a new object as a member of a familiar class, such as a house, a face, or a car. This ability to generalize and deal efficiently with novel stimuli has long been considered a challenging example of brain-like computation that proved extremely difficult to replicate in artificial systems. In this paper we present an approach to generalization and invariant recognition. We focus our discussion on the problem of invariance to position in the visual field, but also sketch how similar principles could apply to other domains. The approach is based on the use of a large repertoire of partial generalizations that are built upon past experience. In the case of shift invariance, visual patterns are described as the conjunction of multiple overlapping image fragments. The invariance to the more primitive fragments is built into the system by past experience. Shift invariance of complex shapes is obtained from the invariance of their constituent fragments. We study by simulations aspects of this shift invariance method and then consider its extensions to invariant perception and classification by brain-like structures.},

abstract = {How do we learn to recognize visual categories, such as dogs and cats? Somehow, the brain uses limited variable examples to extract the essential characteristics of new visual categories. Here, I describe an approach to category learning and recognition that is based on recent computational advances. In this approach, objects are represented by a hierarchy of fragments that are extracted during learning from observed examples. The fragments are class-specific features and are selected to deliver a high amount of information for categorization. The same fragments hierarchy is then used for general categorization, individual object recognition and object-parts identification. Recognition is also combined with object segmentation, using stored fragments, to provide a top-down process that delineates object boundaries in complex cluttered scenes. The approach is computationally effective and provides a possible framework for categorization, recognition and segmentation in human vision.},

abstract = {The human visual system analyzes shapes and objects in a series of stages in which stimulus features of increasing complexity are extracted and analyzed. The first stages use simple local features, and the image is subsequently represented in terms of larger and more complex features. These include features of intermediate complexity and partial object views. The nature and use of these higher-order representations remains an open question in the study of visual processing by the primate cortex. Here we show that intermediate complexity (IC) features are optimal for the basic visual task of classification. Moderately complex features are more informative for classification than very simple or very complex ones, and so they emerge naturally by the simple coding principle of information maximization with respect to a class of images. Our findings suggest a specific role for IC features in visual processing and a principle for their extraction.},

@article{Wallis2001,
abstract = {The influence of temporal association on the representation and recognition of objects was investigated. Observers were shown sequences of novel faces in which the identity of the face changed as the head rotated. As a result, observers showed a tendency to treat the views as if they were of the same person. Additional experiments revealed that this was only true if the training sequences depicted head rotations rather than jumbled views; in other words, the sequence had to be spatially as well as temporally smooth. Results suggest that we are continuously associating views of objects to support later recognition, and that we do so not only on the basis of the physical similarity, but also the correlated appearance in time of the objects.},

We focus on a particular type of model where objects are represented as flexible constellations of rigid parts (features). The variability within a class is represented by a joint probability density function (pdf) on the shape of the constellation and the output of part detectors. In a first stage, the method automatically identifies distinctive parts in the training set by applying a clustering algorithm to patterns selected by an interest operator. It then learns the statistical shape model using expectation maximization. The method achieves very good classification results on human faces and rear views of cars.},

@article{Zhang2010,
abstract = {Learning is thought to facilitate the recognition of objects by optimizing the tuning of visual neurons to behaviorally relevant features. However, the learning mechanisms that shape neural selectivity for visual forms in the human brain remain essentially unknown. Here, we combine behavioral and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measurements to test the mechanisms that mediate enhanced behavioral sensitivity in the discrimination of visual forms after training. In particular, we used high-resolution fMRI and multivoxel pattern classification methods to investigate fine learning-dependent changes in neural preference for global forms. We measured the observers' choices when discriminating between concentric and radial patterns presented in noise before and after training. Similarly, we measured the choices of a pattern classifier when predicting each stimulus from fMRI activity. Comparing the performance of human observers and classifiers demonstrated that learning alters the observers' sensitivity to visual forms and the tuning of fMRI activation patterns in visual areas selective for task-relevant features. In particular, training on low-signal stimuli enhanced the amplitude but reduced the width of pattern-based tuning functions in higher dorsal and ventral visual areas. Thus, our findings suggest that learning of visual patterns is implemented by enhancing the response to the preferred stimulus category and reducing the response to nonpreferred stimuli in higher extrastriate visual cortex.},

order to locate the objects of interest. The fitness function is based on the detection rate and the false alarm rate. We
have tested the method on three object detection problems of increasing difficulty with four different classes of interest.
On pictures of easy and medium difficulty all objects are detected with no false alarms. On difficult pictures there are still
significant numbers of errors, however the results are considerably better than those of a neural network based program for
the same problems.},

  positive definite kernels on probability measures, continuing previous work. This type of kernels has shown very good
  results in text classification and has a wide range of possible
  applications. In this paper we extend the two-parameter family of
  Hilbertian metrics of Topsoe such that it now includes all
  commonly used Hilbertian metrics on probability measures. This
  allows us to do model selection among these metrics in an elegant
  and unified way. Second we investigate further our approach to
  incorporate similarity information of the probability space into
  the kernel. The analysis provides a better understanding of these
  kernels and gives in some cases a more efficient way to compute
  them. Finally we compare all proposed kernels in two text and two
  image classification problems.},

{The Normalized Positive (NPOS) model is a rule-based model that predicts
downbeat location and pattern complexity in rhythmical patterns. Though
derived from several existing models, the NPOS model is particularly
effective at making correct predictions while at the same time having
low complexity. In this paper, the details of the model are explored
and a comparison is made to existing models.  Several datasets are used
to examine the complexity predictions of the model. Special attention
is paid to the model's ability to account for the effects of musical
experience on beat induction.} }

	abstract = {We show that parametric models trained by a stochastic gradient method (SGM) with few iterations have vanishing generalization error. We prove our results by arguing that SGM is algorithmically stable in the sense of Bousquet and Elisseeff. Our analysis only employs elementary tools from convex and continuous optimization. We derive stability bounds for both convex and non-convex optimization under standard Lipschitz and smoothness assumptions. Applying our results to the convex case, we provide new insights for why multiple epochs of stochastic gradient methods generalize well in practice. In the non-convex case, we give a new interpretation of common practices in neural networks, and formally show that popular techniques for training large deep models are indeed stability-promoting. Our findings conceptually underscore the importance of reducing training time beyond its obvious benefit.},

       abstract    = {Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks           (RNNs) are local in space and time and closely related to a biological model of memory in the           prefrontal cortex. Not only are they more biologically plausible than previous artificial RNNs,           they also outperformed them on many artificially generated sequential processing tasks.           This encouraged us to apply LSTM to more realistic problems, such as the recognition of spoken digits.           Without any modification of the underlying algorithm, we achieved results comparable to state-of-the-art Hidden Markov Model           (HMM) based recognisers on both the TIDIGITS and TI46 speech corpora.           We conclude that LSTM should be further investigated as a biologically plausible basis for a bottom-up,           neural net-based approach to speech recognition.}

               capable of robustly categorizing timewarped speech data. We measure its performance on a spoken digit         identification task, where the data was spike-encoded in such a way that classifying the utterances became a         difficult challenge in non-linear timewarping. We find that LSTM gives greatly superior results to an SNN found in the
	               literature, and conclude that the architecture has a place in domains that require the learning of large timewarped datasets,         such as automatic speech recognition.}

	abstract = {We present curiosity-driven, autonomous acquisition of tactile exploratory skills on a biomimetic robot finger equipped with an array of microelectromechanical touch sensors. Instead of building tailored algorithms for solving a specific tactile task, we employ a more general curiosity-driven reinforcement learning approach that autonomously learns a set of motor skills in absence of an explicit teacher signal. In this approach, the acquisition of skills is driven by the information content of the sensory input signals relative to a learner that aims at representing sensory inputs using fewer and fewer computational resources. We show that, from initially random exploration of its environment, the robotic system autonomously develops a small set of basic motor skills that lead to different kinds of tactile input. Next, the system learns how to exploit the learned motor skills to solve supervised texture classification tasks. Our approach demonstrates the feasibility of autonomous acquisition of tactile skills on physical robotic platforms through curiosity-driven reinforcement learning, overcomes typical difficulties of engineered solutions for active tactile exploration and underactuated control, and provides a basis for studying developmental learning through intrinsic motivation in robots.},

  abstract =     "Neutral genotype-phenotype mappings can be observed in
                 natural evolution and are often used in evolutionary
                 computation. In this article, important aspects of such
                 encodings are analysed. First, it is shown that in the
                 absence of external control neutrality allows a
                 variation of the search distribution independent of
                 phenotypic changes. In particular, neutrality is
                 necessary for self-adaptation, which is used in a
                 variety of algorithms from all main paradigms of
                 evolutionary computation to increase efficiency.
                 Second, the average number of fitness evaluations
                 needed to find a desirable (e.g., optimally adapted)
                 genotype depending on the number of desirable genotypes
                 and the cardinality of the genotype space is derived.
                 It turns out that this number increases only marginally
                 when neutrality is added to an encoding presuming that
                 the fraction of desirable genotypes stays constant and
                 that the number of these genotypes is not too small.",

                 in a complex environment with other agents and
                 processes not under its control. Careful management of
                 computational resources is important for complex
                 problem-solving tasks in which the time spent in
                 decision making affects the quality of the responses
                 generated by a system. This paper describes an approach
                 to designing systems that are capable of taking their
                 own computational resources into consideration during
                 planning and problem solving. In particular, we address
                 the design of systems that manage their computational
                 resources by using expectations about the performance
                 of decision-making procedures and preferences over the
                 outcomes resulting from applying those procedures. Our
                 approach is called deliberation scheduling.
                 Deliberation scheduling involves the explicit
                 allocation of computational resources to
                 decision-making procedures based on the expected effect
                 of those allocations on the system's performance.",

  ABSTRACT = {Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks
		  (RNNs) are local in space and time and closely related to a biological model of memory in the
		  prefrontal cortex. Not only are they more biologically plausible than previous artificial RNNs,
		  they also outperformed them on many artificially generated sequential processing tasks.
		  This encouraged us to apply LSTM to more realistic problems, such as the recognition of spoken digits.
		  Without any modification of the underlying algorithm, we achieved results comparable to state-of-the-art Hidden Markov Model
		  (HMM) based recognisers on both the TIDIGITS and TI46 speech corpora.
		  We conclude that LSTM should be further investigated as a biologically plausible basis for a bottom-up,
		  neural net-based approach to speech recognition.}

  ABSTRACT = {In this paper we demonstrate that Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a differentiable recurrent neural net (RNN)
		capable of robustly categorizing timewarped speech data. We measure its performance on a spoken digit
		identification task, where the data was spike-encoded in such a way that classifying the utterances became a
		difficult challenge in non-linear timewarping. We find that LSTM gives greatly superior results to an SNN found in the
		literature, and conclude that the architecture has a place in domains that require the learning of large timewarped datasets,
		such as automatic speech recognition.}

abstract = {In order to make a case for or against a trend in the evolution of complexity in biological evolution, complexity needs to be both rigorously defined and measurable. A recent information-theoretic (but intuitively evident) definition identifies genomic complexity with the amount of information a sequence stores about its environment. We investigate the evolution of genomic complexity in populations of digital organisms and monitor in detail the evolutionary transitions that increase complexity. We show that because natural selection forces genomes to behave as a natural ``Maxwell Demon'', within a fixed environment genomic complexity is forced to increase.},

abstract = {Perceptual learning can be defined as practice-induced improvement in the ability to perform specific perceptual tasks.
We previously proposed the Reverse Hierarchy Theory as a unifying concept that links behavioral findings of visual learning with physiological and anatomical data. Essentially, it asserts that learning is a top-down guided process, which begins at high-level areas of the visual system, and when these do not suffice, progresses backwards to the input levels, which have a better signal-to-noise ratio. This simple concept has proved powerful in explaining a broad range of findings, including seemingly contradicting data. We now extend this concept to describe the dynamics of skill acquisition and interpret recent behavioral and electrophysiological findings.},

@article{BarM1999,
abstract = {Humans often evidence little difficulty at recognizing objects from arbitrary orientations in depth. According to one class of theories, this competence is based on generalization from templates specified by metric properties (MPs), that were learned for the various orientations. An alternative class of theories assumes that non-accidental properties (NAPs) might be exploited so that even novel objects can be recognized under depth rotation. After scaling MP and NAP differences so that they were equally detectable when the objects were at the same orientation in depth, the present investigation assessed the effects of rotation on same-different judgments for matching novel objects. Judgments of a sequential pair of images of novel objects, when rendered from different viewpoints, revealed relatively low costs when the objects differed in a NAP of a single part, i.e. a geon. However, rotation dramatically reduced the detectability of MP differences to a level well below that expected by chance. NAPs offer a striking advantage over MPs for object classification and are therefore more likely to play a central role in the representation of objects.},

By solving a bias-variance trade-off we obtain an early stopping rule and someprobabilistic upper bounds for the convergence of the algorithms. We also discuss the implication of these results in the context of classification where some fast convergence rates can be achieved for plug-in classifiers. Some connections are addressed with Boosting, Landweber iterations, and the online learning algorithms as stochastic approximations of the gradient descent method.",

abstract = {Visual backward masking not only is an empirically rich and theoretically interesting phenomenon but also has found increasing application as a powerful methodological tool in studies of visual information processing and as a useful instrument for investigating visual function in a variety of specific subject populations. Since the dual-channel, sustained-transient approach to visual masking was introduced about two decades ago, several new models of backward masking and metacontrast have been proposed as alternative approaches to visual masking. In this article, we outline, review, and evaluate three such approaches: an extension of the dual-channel approach as realized in the neural network model of retino-cortical dynamics (Ogmen, 1993), the perceptual retouch theory (Bachmann, 1984, 1994), and the boundary contour system (Francis, 1997; Grossberg \& Mingolla, 1985b). Recent psychophysical and electrophysiological findings relevant to backward masking are reviewed and, whenever possible, are related to the aforementioned models. Besides noting the positive aspects of these models, we also list their problems and suggest changes that may improve them and experiments that can empirically test them.},

@article{Chikkerur2010,
abstract = {In the theoretical framework of this paper, attention is part of the inference process that solves the visual recognition problem of what is where. The theory proposes a computational role for attention and leads to a model that predicts some of its main properties at the level of psychophysics and physiology. In our approach, the main goal of the visual system is to infer the identity and the position of objects in visual scenes: spatial attention emerges as a strategy to reduce the uncertainty in shape information while feature-based attention reduces the uncertainty in spatial information. Featural and spatial attention represent two distinct modes of a computational process solving the problem of recognizing and localizing objects, especially in difficult recognition tasks such as in cluttered natural scenes. We describe a specific computational model and relate it to the known functional anatomy of attention. We show that several well-known attentional phenomena – including bottom-up pop-out effects, multiplicative modulation of neuronal tuning curves and shift in contrast responses – all emerge naturally as predictions of the model. We also show that the Bayesian model predicts well human eye fixations (considered as a proxy for shifts of attention) in natural scenes.},

@article{Dakin2005,
abstract = {Summary
Three classes of perceptual phenomena have repeatedly been associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD): superior processing of fine detail (local structure), either inferior processing of overall/global structure or an ability to ignore disruptive global/contextual information, and impaired motion perception. This review evaluates the quality of the evidence bearing on these three phenomena. We argue that while superior local processing has been robustly demonstrated, conclusions about global processing cannot be definitively drawn from the experiments to date, which have generally not precluded observers using more local cues. Perception of moving stimuli is impaired in ASD, but explanations in terms of magnocellular/dorsal deficits do not appear to be sufficient. We suggest that abnormalities in the superior temporal sulcus (STS) may provide a neural basis for the range of motion-processing deficits observed in ASD, including biological motion perception. Such an explanation may also provide a link between perceptual abnormalities and specific deficits in social cognition associated with autism.},

The neural code for written words must be abstract, because we can recognize words regardless of their location, font and size. Yet it must also be exquisitely sensitive to letter identity and letter order. Most existing coding schemes are insufficiently invariant or incompatible with the constraints of the visual system. We propose a tentative neuronal model according to which part of the occipito-temporal 'what' pathway is tuned to writing and forms a hierarchy of local combination detectors sensitive to increasingly larger fragments of words. Our proposal can explain why the detection of 'open bigrams' (ordered pairs of letters) constitutes an important stage in visual word recognition.},

abstract = {After more than a century of research, the mechanisms underlying visual masking are still hotly debated. One key characteristic of masking is that variations in the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) between the target and the mask can lead to either monotonic reductions in the effect of the mask on the target (A-type masking) or an increase in masking for intermediate SOAs and then a decrease in masking for longer SOAs (B-type masking). Past experimental and theoretical work suggested that the type of the masking function depends on the strength of the mask relative to the target. Usually, mask strength is related to energy (stimulus intensity × duration). Here, we show that the overall spatial layout of the mask is a much stronger factor than classical energy to explain the type of masking function.},

The extraction process proceeds in a top-down manner: informative top-level fragments are extracted first, and by a repeated application of the same feature extraction process the classification fragments are broken down successively into their own optimal components. The hierarchical decomposition terminates with atomic features that cannot be usefully decomposed into simpler features. The entire hierarchy, the different features and sub-features, and their optimal parameters, are learned during a training phase using training examples. Experimental comparisons show that these feature hierarchies are significantly more informative and better for classification compared with similar nonhierarchical features as well as previous methods for using feature hierarchies.},

These are local features which are not informative by themselves, and can only be detected reliably at locations specified relative to other features. This makes satellite features difficult to extract by current classification methods. We describe a novel scheme which can extract discriminative satellite features and use them to distinguish between visually similar classes. The algorithm first searches for a set of features ("anchor features") that can be found in all the similar classes. Such features can be detected because the classes are visually similar. The anchors are used to determine the locations of satellite features, which are extracted during learning and used in classification to distinguish between the similar classes. The algorithm is fully automatic, and is shown to work well for many categories of visually similar classes.},

However, parts are often ambiguous on their own and require the prior detection and localization of the entire object.

abstract = {Stable multiday recordings from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of 2 monkeys performing 2 Go/NoGo visual-discrimination tasks (one requiring well-learned responses, the other requiring learning) demonstrate that the majority of prefrontal neurons were "functionally stable". Recordings were made using a series of removable microdrives, each implanted for 3-6 mo, housing independently mobile electrodes. Action potential waveforms of 94 neurons were stable over 2-9 days; 66/94 (70\%) of these cells responded each day, 22/94 (23\%) never responded significantly, and 6/94 (6\%) responded one day but not the next. Of 66 responsive neurons, 55 were selective for either Go or NoGo trials, individual stimuli, or eye movements. This selectivity was functionally stable (i.e., maintained) for 46/55 neurons across all recording days. Functional stability was also noted in terms of response strength (baseline firing rates compared with poststimulation firing rates) and event-related response timing. Two neurons with consistent responses in familiar testing conditions responded flexibly when the monkeys learned to make correct responses to novel stimuli. We conclude that the majority of prefrontal neurons were functionally stable during the performance of well-learned tasks. Such stability may be a general property of prefrontal neurons, given that neurons with 4 different types of task selectivity were found to be functionally stable. Conceptually similar studies based on long-term recordings in other cortical regions reached similar conclusions, suggesting that neurons throughout the brain are functionally stable.},

abstract = {We extend previous work by modeling evolution of communication using a spatialized genetic algorithm which recombines strategies purely locally. Here cellular automata are used as a spatialized environment in which individuals gain points by feeding from drifting food sources and are ‘harmed’ if they fail to hide from migrating predators. Our individuals are capable of making one of two arbitrary sounds, heard only locally by their immediate neighbors. They can respond to sounds from their neighbors by opening their mouths or by hiding. By opening their mouths in the presence of food they maximize gains; by hiding when a predator is present they minimize losses. We consider the result a ‘natural’ template for benefits from communication; unlike a range of other studies, it is here only the recipient of communicated information that immediately benefits. A community of ‘perfect communicators’ could be expected to make a particular sound when successfully feeding, responding to that same sound from their neighbors by opening their mouths. They could be expected to make a different sound when ‘hurt’ and respond to that second sound from their neighbors by hiding. Suppose one starts from a small set of ‘Adam and Eve’ strategies randomized across a cellular automata array, and uses a genetic algorithm which operates purely locally by cross-breeding strategies with their most successful neighbors. Can one, in such an environment, expect evolution of local communities of ‘perfect communicators’? With some important qualifications, the answer is ‘yes’.},

abstract = {The present study investigated how attention to global or local levels of hierarchical patterns modulates brain activities by recording high-density event-related brain potentials (ERPs) evoked by hierarchical stimuli. 120-channel recordings of ERPs were obtained from subjects while they detected targets at global or local levels of hierarchical stimuli displayed in the left or the right visual field. We found that attention to local stimulus features enhanced posterior PI and N2 components, with the N2 enhancement showing a left hemisphere predominance regardless of stimulus positions. Difference was also seen in the distribution of the frontal P2. Reaction times were slowed when global and local levels of stimuli were incompatible, and an interference effect was observed on anterior N2 amplitudes and latencies. Three-dimensional current distributions showed common sources over the posterior cortex between 80-230 ms and a contralateral frontal source between 300-400 ms for global and local conditions. However, an additional ipsilateral frontal focus between 230-350 ms was found specially for local processing. The results corroborate the findings of previous ERP studies, and suggest that the frontal lobe is particularly important for the selective processing of local parts of a global structure.},

It has the attractive property that it side-steps the need to specify the costs of the different kinds of misclassification. However, the simple form is only applicable to the case of two classes. We extend the definition to the case of more than two classes by averaging pairwise comparisons. This measure reduces to the standard form in the two class case. We compare its properties with the standard measure of proportion correct and an alternative definition of proportion correct based on pairwise comparison of classes for a simple artificial case and illustrate its application on eight data sets. On the data sets we examined, the measures produced similar, but not identical results, reflecting the different aspects of performance that they were measuring. Like the area under the ROC curve, the measure we propose is useful in those many situations where it is impossible to give costs for the different kinds of misclassification.},

abstract = {Face perception, perhaps the most highly developed visual skill in humans, is mediated by a distributed neural system in humans that is comprised of multiple, bilateral regions. We propose a model for the organization of this system that emphasizes a distinction between the representation of invariant and changeable aspects of faces. The representation of invariant aspects of faces underlies the recognition of individuals, whereas the representation of changeable aspects of faces, such as eye gaze, expression, and lip movement, underlies the perception of information that facilitates social communication. The model is also hierarchical insofar as it is divided into a core system and an extended system. The core system is comprised of occipitotemporal regions in extrastriate visual cortex that mediate the visual analysis of faces. In the core system, the representation of invariant aspects is mediated more by the face-responsive region in the fusiform gyrus, whereas the representation of changeable aspects is mediated more by the face-responsive region in the superior temporal sulcus. The extended system is comprised of regions from neural systems for other cognitive functions that can be recruited to act in concert with the regions in the core system to extract meaning from faces.},

abstract = {Neurons and neural populations do not function as islands onto themselves. Rather, they interact with other such elements through their afferent and efferent connections in an orchestrated manner so as to enable different sensorimotor and cognitive tasks to be performed. The concept of functional connectivity and the allied notion of effective connectivity were introduced to designate the functional strengths of such interactions. Functional neuroimaging methods, especially PET and fMRI, have been used extensively to evaluate the functional connectivity between different brain regions. After providing a brief historical review of these notions of brain connectivity, I argue that the conceptual formulations of functional and effective connectivity are far from clear. Specifically, the terms functional and effective connectivity are applied to quantities computed on types of functional imaging data (e.g., PET, fMRI, EEG) that vary in spatial, temporal, and other features, using different definitions (even for data of the same modality) and employing different computational algorithms. Until it is understood what each definition means in terms of an underlying neural substrate, comparisons of functional and/or effective connectivity across studies may appear inconsistent and should be performed with great caution.},

abstract = {Identifying a facial feature (e.g. the eyes) is influenced by the position and identity of other features (e.g. the mouth) of the face, supporting the view that an individual face is represented as a whole in the human brain. To clarify how early in the time-course of face processing this holistic individual representation is accessed we recorded event-related potentials during an adaptation paradigm of the composite face illusion (CFI). Observers performed a matching task on top halves of two faces presented sequentially. For each face pair, top and bottom face halves could be both identical, both different, or only the bottom half differed. The signal was larger over the right occipito-temporal cortex at about 160 ms (N170) when the attended top half differed between the two faces than when identical top halves were repeated. Crucially, a larger N170 was also found when the top halves of the two faces were the same, yet the observers had the illusion that they differed (CFI). This effect was not found when the two face halves were spatially misaligned. These observations indicate that the earliest perceptual representation of an individual face in the human brain is holistic rather than based on independent face parts.},

abstract = {The analysis of object shape is critical for both object recognition and grasping. Areas in the intraparietal sulcus of the rhesus monkey are important for the visuomotor transformations underlying actions directed toward objects. The lateral intraparietal (LIP) area has strong anatomical connections with the anterior intraparietal area, which is known to control the shaping of the hand during grasping, and LIP neurons can respond selectively to simple two-dimensional shapes. Here we investigate the shape representation in area LIP of awake rhesus monkeys. Specifically, we determined to what extent LIP neurons are tuned to shape dimensions known to be relevant for grasping and assessed the invariance of their shape preferences with regard to changes in stimulus size and position in the receptive field. Most LIP neurons proved to be significantly tuned to multiple shape dimensions. The population of LIP neurons that were tested showed barely significant size invariance. Position invariance was present in a minority of the neurons tested. Many LIP neurons displayed spurious shape selectivity arising from accidental interactions between the stimulus and the receptive field. We observed pronounced differences in the receptive field profiles determined by presenting two different shapes. Almost all LIP neurons showed spatially selective saccadic activity, but the receptive field for saccades did not always correspond to the receptive field as determined using shapes. Our results demonstrate that a subpopulation of LIP neurons encodes stimulus shape. Furthermore, the shape representation in the dorsal visual stream appears to differ radically from the known representation of shape in the ventral visual stream.},

abstract = {Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying object recognition is one of the fundamental challenges of visual neuroscience. While neurophysiology experiments have provided evidence for a "simple-to-complex" processing model based on a hierarchy of increasingly complex image features, behavioral and fMRI studies of face processing have been interpreted as incompatible with this account. We present a neurophysiologically plausible, feature-based model that quantitatively accounts for face discrimination characteristics, including face inversion and "configural" effects. The model predicts that face discrimination is based on a sparse representation of units selective for face shapes, without the need to postulate additional, "face-specific" mechanisms. We derive and test predictions that quantitatively link model FFA face neuron tuning, neural adaptation measured in an fMRI rapid adaptation paradigm, and face discrimination performance. The experimental data are in excellent agreement with the model prediction that discrimination performance should asymptote as faces become dissimilar enough to activate different neuronal populations.},

abstract = {The classification behaviour of human observers with respect to compound Gabor signals is tested at foveal and extrafoveal retinal positions. Classification performance is analysed in terms of a probabilistic classification model recently proposed by Rentschler, J\"{u}ttner and Caelli [(1994)Vision Research, 34, 669-687]. The analysis allows inferences about structure and dimensionality of the individual internal representations underlying the classification task and their temporal evolution during the learning process. Using this technique it is found that the internal representations of direct and eccentric viewing are intrinsically incommensurable, in the sense that extrafoveal pattern representations are characterized by a lower perceptual dimension in feature space relative to the corresponding physical input signals, whereas foveal representations are not. The observed deficits cannot be renormalized by size scaling (cortical magnification); however, they can be partially reduced by learning although the learning progress strongly depends on the observer's practice. The structural incommensurability between foveal and extrafoveal representations poses constraints on possible forms of foveal-extrafoveal interaction, which might have implications on related perceptual phenomena such as visual stability across saccadic eye movements.},

Here we examined the role of task on fast perceptual learning for shape localisation either in simple detection or based on form discrimination in different visual submodalities, using identical stimulus position and stimulus types for both tasks. Thresholds for each submodality were identified by four-alternative-forced-choice tasks. Fast perceptual learning occurred for shape detection-based on luminance, motion and color differences but not for texture differences. In contradistinction, fast perceptual learning was not evident in shape localisation based on discrimination. Thresholds of all submodalities were stable across days. Fast perceptual learning seems to differ not only between different visual submodalities, but also across different tasks within the same visual submodality.},

abstract = {It is widely assumed that high-level visual object representations are position-independent (or invariant). While there is sensitivity to position in high-level object-selective cortex, position and object identity are thought to be encoded independently in the population response such that position information is available across objects and object information is available across positions. Contrary to this view, we show, with both behavior and neuroimaging, that visual object representations are position-dependent (tied to limited portions of the visual field). Behaviorally, we show that the effect of priming an object was greatly reduced with any change in position (within- or between-hemifields), indicating nonoverlapping representations of the same object across different positions. Furthermore, using neuroimaging, we show that object-selective cortex is not only highly sensitive to object position but also the ability to differentiate objects based on its response is greatly reduced across different positions, consistent with the observed behavior and the receptive field properties observed in macaque object-selective neurons. Thus, even at the population level, the object information available in response of object-selective cortex is constrained by position. We conclude that even high-level visual object representations are position-dependent.},

We characterized LFPs and their relationship to spikes (multi and single unit) in monkey inferior temporal cortex (IT). LFP responses in IT to complex objects showed strong selectivity at 44\% of the sites and tolerance to retinal position and size. The LFP preferences were poorly predicted by the spike preferences at the same site but were better explained by averaging spikes within approximately 3 mm. A comparison of separate sites suggests that selectivity is similar on a scale of approximately 800 microm for spikes and approximately 5 mm for LFPs. These observations imply that inputs to IT neurons convey selectivity for complex shapes and that such input may have an underlying organization spanning several millimeters.},

abstract = {Learning visual models of object categories notoriously requires hundreds or thousands of training examples. We show that it is possible to learn much information about a category from just one, or a handful, of images. The key insight is that, rather than learning from scratch, one can take advantage of knowledge coming from previously learned categories, no matter how different these categories might be. We explore a Bayesian implementation of this idea. Object categories are represented by probabilistic models. Prior knowledge is represented as a probability density function on the parameters of these models. The posterior model for an object category is obtained by updating the prior in the light of one or more observations. We test a simple implementation of our algorithm on a database of 101 diverse object categories. We compare category models learned by an implementation of our Bayesian approach to models learned from by maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum a posteriori (MAP) methods. We find that on a database of more than 100 categories, the Bayesian approach produces informative models when the number of training examples is too small for other methods to operate successfully.},

abstract = {We easily recognize objects and faces across a myriad of retinal images produced by each object. One hypothesis is that this tolerance (a.k.a. invariance) is learned by relying on the fact that object identities are temporally stable. While we previously found neuronal evidence supporting this idea at the top of the nonhuman primate ventral visual stream (inferior temporal cortex, or IT), we here test if this is a general tolerance learning mechanism. First, we found that the same type of unsupervised experience that reshaped IT position tolerance also predictably reshaped IT size tolerance, and the magnitude of reshaping was quantitatively similar. Second, this tolerance reshaping can be induced under naturally occurring dynamic visual experience, even without eye movements. Third, unsupervised temporal contiguous experience can build new neuronal tolerance. These results suggest that the ventral visual stream uses a general unsupervised tolerance learning algorithm to build its invariant object representation.  Unsupervised experience with temporally contiguous images reshapes IT size tolerance.  This tolerance learning takes place under natural vision conditions. The learning can build new IT tolerance, dictated by the experience provided.  The temporal asymmetry of the learning suggests a Hebbian-like mechanism

abstract = {Object recognition is challenging because each object produces myriad retinal images. Responses of neurons from the inferior temporal cortex (IT) are selective to different objects, yet tolerant ("invariant") to changes in object position, scale, and pose. How does the brain construct this neuronal tolerance? We report a form of neuronal learning that suggests the underlying solution. Targeted alteration of the natural temporal contiguity of visual experience caused specific changes in IT position tolerance. This unsupervised temporal slowness learning (UTL) was substantial, increased with experience, and was significant in single IT neurons after just 1 hour. Together with previous theoretical work and human object perception experiments, we speculate that UTL may reflect the mechanism by which the visual stream builds and maintains tolerant object representations.},

abstract = {A new spatiotemporal filtering method for single-trial event-related potential (ERP) estimation is proposed. Instead of attempting to model the entire ERP waveform, the method relies on modeling ERP component descriptors (amplitude and latency) thru the spatial diversity of multichannel recordings, and thus, it is tailored to extract signals in negative SNR conditions. The model allows for both amplitude and latency variability in the ERP component under investigation. The extracted ERP component is constrained through a spatial filter to have minimal distance (with respect to some metric) in the temporal domain from a user-designed template component. The spatial filter may be interpreted as a noise canceller in the spatial domain. Study with both simulated data and real cognitive ERP data shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

abstract = {This article provides a new, more comprehensive view of event-related brain dynamics founded on an information-based approach to modeling electroencephalographic (EEG) dynamics. Most EEG research focuses either on peaks 'evoked' in average event-related potentials (ERPs) or on changes 'induced' in the EEG power spectrum by experimental events. Although these measures are nearly complementary, they do not fully model the event-related dynamics in the data, and cannot isolate the signals of the contributing cortical areas. We propose that many ERPs and other EEG features are better viewed as time/frequency perturbations of underlying field potential processes. The new approach combines independent component analysis (ICA), time/frequency analysis, and trial-by-trial visualization that measures EEG source dynamics without requiring an explicit head model.},

@article{Mel1997,
abstract = {Severe architectural and timing constraints within the primate visual system support the conjecture that the early phase of object recognition in the brain is based on a feedforward feature-extraction hierarchy. To assess the plausibility of this conjecture in an engineering context, a difficult three-dimensional object recognition domain was developed to challenge a pure feedforward, receptive-field based recognition model called SEEMORE. SEEMORE is based on 102 viewpoint-invariant nonlinear filters that as a group are sensitive to contour, texture, and color cues. The visual domain consists of 100 real objects of many different types, including rigid (shovel), nonrigid (telephone cord), and statistical (maple leaf cluster) objects and photographs of complex scenes. Objects were in dividually presented in color video images under normal room lighting conditions. Based on 12 to 36 training views, SEEMORE was required to recognize unnormalized test views of objects that could vary in position, orientation in the image plane and in depth, and scale (factor of 2); for non rigid objects, recognition was also tested under gross shape deformations. Correct classification performance on a test set consisting of 600 novel object views was 97 percent (chance was 1 percent) and was comparable for the subset of 15 nonrigid objects. Performance was also measured under a variety of image degradation conditions, including partial occlusion, limited clutter, color shift, and additive noise. Generalization behavior and classification errors illustrate the emergence of several striking natural shape categories that are not explicitly encoded in the dimensions of the feature space. It is concluded that in the light of the vast hardware resources available in the ventral stream of the primate visual system relative to those exercised here, the appealingly simple feature-space conjecture remains worthy of serious consideration as a neurobiological model.},

abstract = {Four experiments were conducted to study the nature of visual translation invariance in humans. In all the experiments, subjects were trained to discriminate between a previously unknown target and two non-target distractors presented at a fixed retinal location to one side of the fixation point. In a subsequent test phase, this performance was compared with the performance when the patterns were presented either centrally at the fixation point or at a location on the other side of the fixation point, opposite to the location where the patterns were learned, but where acuity was identical to what it was at the learned location. Two different experimental paradigms were used. One used an eye movement control device (Experiment 1) to ensure the eye could not move relative to the patterns to be learned. In the other three experiments, presentation duration of the patterns was restricted to a short enough period to preclude eye movements. During the training period in Experiments 1 and 2, presentation location of the patterns was centered at 2.4 deg in the periphery, whereas in Experiments 3 and 4 presentation eccentricity was reduced to 0.86 and 0.49 deg. In all four experiments performance dropped when the pattern had to be recognized at new test positions. This result suggests that the visual system does not apply a global transposition transformation to the retinal image to compensate for translations. We propose that, instead, it decomposes the image into simple features which themselves are more-or-less translation invariant. If in a given task, patterns can be discriminated using these simple features, then translation invariance will occur. If not, then translation invariance will fail or be incomplete.},

abstract = {Most theories of visual search emphasize issues of limited versus unlimited capacity and serial versus parallel processing. In the present article, we suggest a broader framework based on two principles, one empirical and one theoretical. The empirical principle is to focus on conditions at the intersection of visual search and the simple detection and discrimination paradigms of spatial vision. Such simple search conditions avoid artifacts and phenomena specific to more complex stimuli and tasks. The theoretical principle is to focus on the distinction between high and low threshold theory. While high threshold theory is largely discredited for simple detection and discrimination, it persists in the search literature. Furthermore, a low threshold theory such as signal detection theory can account for some of the phenomena attributed to limited capacity or serial processing. In the body of this article, we compare the predictions of high threshold theory and three versions of signal detection theory to the observed effects of manipulating set size, discriminability, number of targets, response bias, external noise, and distractor heterogeneity. For almost all cases, the results are inconsistent with high threshold theory and are consistent with all three versions of signal detection theory. In the Discussion, these simple theories are generalized to a larger domain that includes search asymmetry, multidimensional judgements including conjunction search, response time, search with multiple eye fixations and more general stimulus conditions. We conclude that low threshold theories can account for simple visual search without invoking mechanisms such as limited capacity or serial processing.},

abstract = {Summary
A key to understanding visual cognition is to determine when, how, and with what information the human brain distinguishes between visual categories. So far, the dynamics of information processing for categorization of visual stimuli has not been elucidated. By using an ecologically important categorization task (seven expressions of emotion), we demonstrate, in three human observers, that an early brain event (the N170 Event Related Potential, occurring 170 ms after stimulus onset [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15] and [16]) integrates visual information specific to each expression, according to a pattern. Specifically, starting 50 ms prior to the ERP peak, facial information tends to be integrated from the eyes downward in the face. This integration stops, and the ERP peaks, when the information diagnostic for judging a particular expression has been integrated (e.g., the eyes in fear, the corners of the nose in disgust, or the mouth in happiness). Consequently, the duration of information integration from the eyes down determines the latency of the N170 for each expression (e.g., with "fear" being faster than "disgust," itself faster than "happy"). For the first time in visual categorization, we relate the dynamics of an important brain event to the dynamics of a precise information-processing function.},

abstract = {We introduce a new general framework for the recognition of complex visual scenes, which is motivated by biology: We describe a hierarchical system that closely follows the organization of visual cortex and builds an increasingly complex and invariant feature representation by alternating between a template matching and a maximum pooling operation. We demonstrate the strength of the approach on a range of recognition tasks: From invariant single object recognition in clutter to multiclass categorization problems and complex scene understanding tasks that rely on the recognition of both shape-based as well as texture-based objects. Given the biological constraints that the system had to satisfy, the approach performs surprisingly well: It has the capability of learning from only a few training examples and competes with state-of-the-art systems. We also discuss the existence of a universal, redundant dictionary of features that could handle the recognition of most object categories. In addition to its relevance for computer vision, the success of this approach suggests a plausibility proof for a class of feedforward models of object recognition in cortex.},

abstract = {Primates are remarkably good at recognizing objects. The level of performance of their visual system and its robustness to image degradations still surpasses the best computer vision systems despite decades of engineering effort. In particular, the high accuracy of primates in ultra rapid object categorization and rapid serial visual presentation tasks is remarkable. Given the number of processing stages involved and typical neural latencies, such rapid visual processing is likely to be mostly feedforward. Here we show that a specific implementation of a class of feedforward theories of object recognition (that extend the Hubel and Wiesel simple-to-complex cell hierarchy and account for many anatomical and physiological constraints) can predict the level and the pattern of performance achieved by humans on a rapid masked animal vs. non-animal categorization task.},

abstract = {Models of object recognition in cortex have so far been mostly applied to tasks involving the recognition of isolated objects presented on blank backgrounds. However, ultimately models of the visual system have to prove themselves in real world object recognition tasks. Here we took a first step in this direction: We investigated the performance of the HMAX model of object recognition in cortex recently presented by Riesenhuber \& Poggio [1],[2] on the task of face detection using natural images. We found that the standard version of hmax performs rather poorly on this task, due to the low specificity of the hardwired feature set of C2 units in the model (corresponding to neurons in intermediate visual area V4) that do not show any particular tuning for faces vs. background. We show how visual features of intermediate complexity can be learned in HMAX using a simple learning rule. Using this rule, hmax outperforms a classical machine vision face detection system presented in the literature. This suggests an important role for the set of features in intermediate visual areas in object recognition.},

Our approach is predicated on the assumption that each image is generated by a sparse set of visual “causes” and that images which are visually similar share causes. We propose a mechanism for computing a very large number of highly selective features which capture some aspects of this causal structure (in our implementation there are over 46,000 highly selective features). At query time a user selects a few example images, and the AdaBoost algorithm is used to learn a classification function which depends on a small number of the most appropriate features. This yields a highly efficient classification function. In addition we show that the AdaBoost framework provides a natural mechanism for the incorporation of relevance feedback. Finally we show results on a wide variety of image queries.},

abstract = {A fundamental capacity of the perceptual systems and the brain in general is to deal with the novel and the unexpected. In vision, we can effortlessly recognize a familiar object under novel viewing conditions, or recognize a new object as a member of a familiar class, such as a house, a face, or a car. This ability to generalize and deal efficiently with novel stimuli has long been considered a challenging example of brain-like computation that proved extremely difficult to replicate in artificial systems. In this paper we present an approach to generalization and invariant recognition. We focus our discussion on the problem of invariance to position in the visual field, but also sketch how similar principles could apply to other domains. The approach is based on the use of a large repertoire of partial generalizations that are built upon past experience. In the case of shift invariance, visual patterns are described as the conjunction of multiple overlapping image fragments. The invariance to the more primitive fragments is built into the system by past experience. Shift invariance of complex shapes is obtained from the invariance of their constituent fragments. We study by simulations aspects of this shift invariance method and then consider its extensions to invariant perception and classification by brain-like structures.},

abstract = {How do we learn to recognize visual categories, such as dogs and cats? Somehow, the brain uses limited variable examples to extract the essential characteristics of new visual categories. Here, I describe an approach to category learning and recognition that is based on recent computational advances. In this approach, objects are represented by a hierarchy of fragments that are extracted during learning from observed examples. The fragments are class-specific features and are selected to deliver a high amount of information for categorization. The same fragments hierarchy is then used for general categorization, individual object recognition and object-parts identification. Recognition is also combined with object segmentation, using stored fragments, to provide a top-down process that delineates object boundaries in complex cluttered scenes. The approach is computationally effective and provides a possible framework for categorization, recognition and segmentation in human vision.},

abstract = {The human visual system analyzes shapes and objects in a series of stages in which stimulus features of increasing complexity are extracted and analyzed. The first stages use simple local features, and the image is subsequently represented in terms of larger and more complex features. These include features of intermediate complexity and partial object views. The nature and use of these higher-order representations remains an open question in the study of visual processing by the primate cortex. Here we show that intermediate complexity (IC) features are optimal for the basic visual task of classification. Moderately complex features are more informative for classification than very simple or very complex ones, and so they emerge naturally by the simple coding principle of information maximization with respect to a class of images. Our findings suggest a specific role for IC features in visual processing and a principle for their extraction.},

@article{Wallis2001,
abstract = {The influence of temporal association on the representation and recognition of objects was investigated. Observers were shown sequences of novel faces in which the identity of the face changed as the head rotated. As a result, observers showed a tendency to treat the views as if they were of the same person. Additional experiments revealed that this was only true if the training sequences depicted head rotations rather than jumbled views; in other words, the sequence had to be spatially as well as temporally smooth. Results suggest that we are continuously associating views of objects to support later recognition, and that we do so not only on the basis of the physical similarity, but also the correlated appearance in time of the objects.},

We focus on a particular type of model where objects are represented as flexible constellations of rigid parts (features). The variability within a class is represented by a joint probability density function (pdf) on the shape of the constellation and the output of part detectors. In a first stage, the method automatically identifies distinctive parts in the training set by applying a clustering algorithm to patterns selected by an interest operator. It then learns the statistical shape model using expectation maximization. The method achieves very good classification results on human faces and rear views of cars.},

@article{Zhang2010,
abstract = {Learning is thought to facilitate the recognition of objects by optimizing the tuning of visual neurons to behaviorally relevant features. However, the learning mechanisms that shape neural selectivity for visual forms in the human brain remain essentially unknown. Here, we combine behavioral and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measurements to test the mechanisms that mediate enhanced behavioral sensitivity in the discrimination of visual forms after training. In particular, we used high-resolution fMRI and multivoxel pattern classification methods to investigate fine learning-dependent changes in neural preference for global forms. We measured the observers' choices when discriminating between concentric and radial patterns presented in noise before and after training. Similarly, we measured the choices of a pattern classifier when predicting each stimulus from fMRI activity. Comparing the performance of human observers and classifiers demonstrated that learning alters the observers' sensitivity to visual forms and the tuning of fMRI activation patterns in visual areas selective for task-relevant features. In particular, training on low-signal stimuli enhanced the amplitude but reduced the width of pattern-based tuning functions in higher dorsal and ventral visual areas. Thus, our findings suggest that learning of visual patterns is implemented by enhancing the response to the preferred stimulus category and reducing the response to nonpreferred stimuli in higher extrastriate visual cortex.},

abstract = {We describe an approach to the use of genetic programming for object detection problems in which the locations of small objects
of multiple classes in large pictures must be found. The evolved programs use a feature set computed from a square input field
large enough to contain each of objects of interest and are applied, in moving window fashion, over the large pictures in
order to locate the objects of interest. The fitness function is based on the detection rate and the false alarm rate. We
have tested the method on three object detection problems of increasing difficulty with four different classes of interest.
On pictures of easy and medium difficulty all objects are detected with no false alarms. On difficult pictures there are still
significant numbers of errors, however the results are considerably better than those of a neural network based program for
the same problems.},

abstract="Solutions of learning problems by Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) -- and almost-ERM when the minimizer does not exist -- need to be consistent, so that they may be predictive. They also need to be well-posed in the sense of being stable, so that they might be used robustly. We propose a statistical form of stability, defined as leave-one-out (LOO) stability. We prove that for bounded loss classes LOO stability is (a) sufficient for generalization, that is convergence in probability of the empirical error to the expected error, for any algorithm satisfying it and, (b) necessary and sufficient for consistency of ERM. Thus LOO stability is a weak form of stability that represents a sufficient condition for generalization for symmetric learning algorithms while subsuming the classical conditions for consistency of ERM. In particular, we conclude that a certain form of well-posedness and consistency are equivalent for ERM.",

We prove that with Gaussian input $\mathbf{Z}$ there is a spurious local minimizer. Surprisingly, in the presence of the spurious local minimizer, starting from randomly initialized weights, gradient descent with weight normalization can still be proven to recover the true parameters with constant probability (which can be boosted to probability $1$ with multiple restarts). We also show that with constant probability, the same procedure could also converge to the spurious local minimum, showing that the local minimum plays a non-trivial role in the dynamics of gradient descent. Furthermore, a quantitative analysis shows that the gradient descent dynamics has two phases: it starts off slow, but converges much faster after several iterations.}
