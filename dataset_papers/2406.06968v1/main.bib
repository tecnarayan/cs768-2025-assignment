  abstract = 	 {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layerâ€™s inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization, and in some cases eliminates the need for Dropout. Applied to a stateof-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.82% top-5 test error, exceeding the accuracy of human raters.}

title = {Individual calibration with randomized forecasting},
year = {2020},
publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {Machine learning applications often require calibrated predictions, e.g. a 90\% credible interval should contain the true outcome 90\% of the times. However, typical definitions of calibration only require this to hold on average, and offer no guarantees on predictions made on individual samples. Thus, predictions can be systematically over or under confident on certain subgroups, leading to issues of fairness and potential vulnerabilities. We show that calibration for individual samples is possible in the regression setup if the predictions are randomized, i.e. outputting randomized credible intervals. Randomization removes systematic bias by trading off bias with variance. We design a training objective to enforce individual calibration and use it to train randomized regression functions. The resulting models are more calibrated for arbitrarily chosen subgroups of the data, and can achieve higher utility in decision making against adversaries that exploit miscalibrated predictions.},

abstract = {Deep learning, due to its unprecedented success in tasks such as image classification, has emerged as a new tool in image reconstruction with potential to change the field. In this paper, we demonstrate a crucial phenomenon: Deep learning typically yields unstable methods for image reconstruction. The instabilities usually occur in several forms: 1) Certain tiny, almost undetectable perturbations, both in the image and sampling domain, may result in severe artefacts in the reconstruction; 2) a small structural change, for example, a tumor, may not be captured in the reconstructed image; and 3) (a counterintuitive type of instability) more samples may yield poorer performance. Our stability test with algorithms and easy-to-use software detects the instability phenomena. The test is aimed at researchers, to test their networks for instabilities, and for government agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), to secure safe use of deep learning methods.}}

Some partial solutions have been suggested in the past. Both the original method and these solutions were based on transductive inference. In this paper we make a radical step of replacing transductive inference with inductive inference and define what we call the Inductive Confidence Machine (ICM); our main concern in this paper is the use of ICM in regression problems. The algorithm proposed in this paper is based on the Ridge Regression procedure (which is usually used for outputting bare predictions) and is much faster than the existing transductive techniques. The inductive approach described in this paper may be the only option available when dealing with large data sets.",

On the other hand, exact conditional inference guarantees are known to be impossible without imposing assumptions on the underlying distribution. In this work, we aim to explore the space in between these two and examine what types of relaxations of the conditional coverage property would alleviate some of the practical concerns with marginal coverage guarantees while still being possible to achieve in a distribution-free setting.}",

ABSTRACT = {Predicting not only the target but also an accurate measure of uncertainty is important for many machine learning applications, and in particular, safety-critical ones. In this work, we study the calibration of uncertainty prediction for regression tasks which often arise in real-world systems. We show that the existing definition for the calibration of regression uncertainty has severe limitations in distinguishing informative from non-informative uncertainty predictions. We propose a new definition that escapes this caveat and an evaluation method using a simple histogram-based approach. Our method clusters examples with similar uncertainty prediction and compares the prediction with the empirical uncertainty on these examples. We also propose a simple, scaling-based calibration method that preforms as well as much more complex ones. We show results on both a synthetic, controlled problem and on the object detection bounding-box regression task using the COCO and KITTI datasets.},
