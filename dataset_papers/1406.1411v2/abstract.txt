This work presents novel algorithms for learning Bayesian network structures
with bounded treewidth. Both exact and approximate methods are developed. The
exact method combines mixed-integer linear programming formulations for
structure learning and treewidth computation. The approximate method consists
in uniformly sampling $k$-trees (maximal graphs of treewidth $k$), and
subsequently selecting, exactly or approximately, the best structure whose
moral graph is a subgraph of that $k$-tree. Some properties of these methods
are discussed and proven. The approaches are empirically compared to each other
and to a state-of-the-art method for learning bounded treewidth structures on a
collection of public data sets with up to 100 variables. The experiments show
that our exact algorithm outperforms the state of the art, and that the
approximate approach is fairly accurate.
