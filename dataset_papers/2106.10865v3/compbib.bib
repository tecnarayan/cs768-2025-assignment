abstract = {Quantification of the stationary points and the associated basins of attraction of neural network loss surfaces is an important step towards a better understanding of neural network loss surfaces at large. This work proposes a novel method to visualise basins of attraction together with the associated stationary points via gradient-based stochastic sampling. The proposed technique is used to perform an empirical study of the loss surfaces generated by two different error metrics: quadratic loss and entropic loss. The empirical observations confirm the theoretical hypothesis regarding the nature of neural network attraction basins. Entropic loss is shown to exhibit stronger gradients and fewer stationary points than quadratic loss, indicating that entropic loss has a more searchable landscape. Quadratic loss is shown to be more resilient to overfitting than entropic loss. Both losses are shown to exhibit local minima, but the number of local minima is shown to decrease with an increase in dimensionality. Thus, the proposed visualisation technique successfully captures the local minima properties exhibited by the neural network loss surfaces, and can be used for the purpose of fitness landscape analysis of neural networks.}

  abstract = 	 { Despite the popularity of Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) algorithms, a theory that explains their statistical properties in modern high-dimensional regimes is only recently emerging. We characterize for the first time the fundamental limits on the statistical accuracy of convex ridge-regularized ERM for inference in high-dimensional generalized linear models. For a stylized setting with Gaussian features and problem dimensions that grow large at a proportional rate, we start with sharp performance characterizations and then derive tight lower bounds on the estimation and prediction error. Our bounds provably hold over a wide class of loss functions, and, for any value of the regularization parameter and of the sampling ratio. Our precise analysis has several attributes. First, it leads to a recipe for optimally tuning the loss function and the regularization parameter. Second, it allows to precisely quantify the sub-optimality of popular heuristic choices, such as optimally-tuned least-squares. Third, we use the bounds to precisely assess the merits of ridge-regularization as a function of the sampling ratio. Our bounds are expressed in terms of the Fisher Information of random variables that are simple functions of the data distribution, thus making ties to corresponding bounds in classical statistics. }

  abstract = 	 {We study convex empirical risk minimization for high-dimensional inference in binary models. Our first result sharply predicts the statistical performance of such estimators in the linear asymptotic regime under isotropic Gaussian features. Importantly, the predictions hold for a wide class of convex loss functions, which we exploit in order to prove a bound on the best achievable performance among them. Notably, we show that the proposed bound is tight for popular binary models (such as Signed, Logistic or Probit), by constructing appropriate loss functions that achieve it. More interestingly, for binary linear classification under the Logistic and Probit models, we prove that the performance of least-squares is no worse than 0.997 and 0.98 times the optimal one. Numerical simulations corroborate our theoretical findings and suggest they are accurate even for relatively small problem dimensions. }

	abstract = {While breakthroughs in machine learning and artificial intelligence are changing society, our fundamental understanding has lagged behind. It is traditionally believed that fitting models to the training data exactly is to be avoided as it leads to poor performance on unseen data. However, powerful modern classifiers frequently have near-perfect fit in training, a disconnect that spurred recent intensive research and controversy on whether theory provides practical insights. In this work, we show how classical theory and modern practice can be reconciled within a single unified performance curve and propose a mechanism underlying its emergence. We believe this previously unknown pattern connecting the structure and performance of learning architectures will help shape design and understanding of learning algorithms.Breakthroughs in machine learning are rapidly changing science and society, yet our fundamental understanding of this technology has lagged far behind. Indeed, one of the central tenets of the field, the bias{\textendash}variance trade-off, appears to be at odds with the observed behavior of methods used in modern machine-learning practice. The bias{\textendash}variance trade-off implies that a model should balance underfitting and overfitting: Rich enough to express underlying structure in data and simple enough to avoid fitting spurious patterns. However, in modern practice, very rich models such as neural networks are trained to exactly fit (i.e., interpolate) the data. Classically, such models would be considered overfitted, and yet they often obtain high accuracy on test data. This apparent contradiction has raised questions about the mathematical foundations of machine learning and their relevance to practitioners. In this paper, we reconcile the classical understanding and the modern practice within a unified performance curve. This {\textquotedblleft}double-descent{\textquotedblright} curve subsumes the textbook U-shaped bias{\textendash}variance trade-off curve by showing how increasing model capacity beyond the point of interpolation results in improved performance. We provide evidence for the existence and ubiquity of double descent for a wide spectrum of models and datasets, and we posit a mechanism for its emergence. This connection between the performance and the structure of machine-learning models delineates the limits of classical analyses and has implications for both the theory and the practice of machine learning.},

	Abstract = {Gradient descent, when applied to the task of logistic regression, outputs iterates which are biased to follow a unique ray defined by the data. The direction of this ray is the maximum margin predictor of a maximal linearly separable subset of the data; the gradient descent iterates converge to this ray in direction at the rate $\cO(\nicefrac{\ln\ln t }{\ln t})$. The ray does not pass through the origin in general, and its offset is the bounded global optimum of the risk over the remaining data; gradient descent recovers this offset at a rate $\cO(\nicefrac{(\ln t)^2}{\sqrt{t}})$.},

abstract = {We present a unifying framework for studying the solution of multiclass categorization problems by reducing them to multiple binary problems that are then solved using a margin-based binary learning algorithm. The proposed framework unifies some of the most popular approaches in which each class is compared against all others, or in which all pairs of classes are compared to each other, or in which output codes with error-correcting properties are used. We propose a general method for combining the classifiers generated on the binary problems, and we prove a general empirical multiclass loss bound given the empirical loss of the individual binary learning algorithms. The scheme and the corresponding bounds apply to many popular classification learning algorithms including support-vector machines, AdaBoost, regression, logistic regression and decision-tree algorithms. We also give a multiclass generalization error analysis for general output codes with AdaBoost as the binary learner. Experimental results with SVM and AdaBoost show that our scheme provides a viable alternative to the most commonly used multiclass algorithms.},
