It is a challenging task to select correlated variables in a high dimensional
space. To address this challenge, the elastic net has been developed and
successfully applied to many applications. Despite its great success, the
elastic net does not explicitly use correlation information embedded in data to
select correlated variables. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel
Bayesian hybrid model, the EigenNet, that uses the eigenstructures of data to
guide variable selection. Specifically, it integrates a sparse conditional
classification model with a generative model capturing variable correlations in
a principled Bayesian framework. We reparameterize the hybrid model in the
eigenspace to avoid overfiting and to increase the computational efficiency of
its MCMC sampler. Furthermore, we provide an alternative view to the EigenNet
from a regularization perspective: the EigenNet has an adaptive
eigenspace-based composite regularizer, which naturally generalizes the
$l_{1/2}$ regularizer used by the elastic net. Experiments on synthetic and
real data show that the EigenNet significantly outperforms the lasso, the
elastic net, and the Bayesian lasso in terms of prediction accuracy, especially
when the number of training samples is smaller than the number of variables.
