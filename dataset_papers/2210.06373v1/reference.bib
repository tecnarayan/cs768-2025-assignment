    abstract  = {Recognition of three dimensional (3D) objects in noisy and cluttered scenes is a challenging problem in 3D computer vision. One approach that has been successful in past research is the regional shape descriptor. In this paper, we introduce two new regional shape descriptors: 3D shape contexts and harmonic shape contexts. We evaluate the performance of these descriptors on the task of recognizing vehicles in range scans of scenes using a database of 56 cars. We compare the two novel descriptors to an existing descriptor, the spin image, showing that the shape context based descriptors have a higher recognition rate on noisy scenes and that 3D shape contexts outperform the others on cluttered scenes.},

    year      = {2016},
    abstract  = {We consider image transformation problems, where an input image is transformed into an output image. Recent methods for such problems typically train feed-forward convolutional neural networks using a per-pixel loss between the output and ground-truth images. Parallel work has shown that high-quality images can be generated by defining and optimizing perceptual loss functions based on high-level features extracted from pretrained networks. We combine the benefits of both approaches, and propose the use of perceptual loss functions for training feed-forward networks for image transformation tasks. We show results on image style transfer, where a feed-forward network is trained to solve the optimization problem proposed by Gatys et al. in real-time. Compared to the optimization-based method, our network gives similar qualitative results but is three orders of magnitude faster. We also experiment with single-image super-resolution, where replacing a per-pixel loss with a perceptual loss gives visually pleasing results.},

Then, by discussion and experiments alike, we point out the key issues of uniqueness and repeatability of the local reference frame. Based on these observations, we formulate a novel comprehensive proposal for surface representation, which encompasses a new unique and repeatable local reference frame as well as a new 3D descriptor. The latter lays at the intersection between Signatures and Histograms, so as to possibly achieve a better balance between descriptiveness and robustness. Experiments on publicly available datasets as well as on range scans obtained with Spacetime Stereo provide a thorough validation of our proposal.},

While previous works have successfully tackled each one of these problems individually, we show how to learn to do all three in a unified manner while preserving end-to-end differentiability. We then demonstrate that our Deep pipeline outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a number of benchmark datasets, without the need of retraining.},
