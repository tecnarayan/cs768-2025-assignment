A model is presented which allows individual error-rates to be estimated for polytomous facets even when the patient's "true" response is not available. The EM algorithm is shown to provide a slow but sure way of obtaining maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of interest. Some preliminary experience is reported and the limitations of the method are described.},
