	abstract = {In Rn let Ω denote a Nikodym region (= a connected open set on which every distribution of finite Dirichlet integral is itself in L2(Ω)). The existence of n commuting self-adjoint operators H1,…, Hn in L2(Ω) such that each Hj is a restriction of −i ββxj (acting in the distribution sense) is shown to be equivalent to the existence of a set Λ ⊂Rn such that the restrictions to Ω of the functions exp i ∑ λjxj form a total orthogonal family in L2(Ω). If it is required, in addition, that the unitary groups generated by H1,…, Hn act multiplicatively on L2(Ω), then this is shown to correspond to the requirement that Λ can be chosen as a subgroup of the additive group Rn. The measurable sets Ω ⊂Rn (of finite Lebesgue measure) for which there exists a subgroup Λ ⊂Rn as stated are precisely those measurable sets which (after a correction by a null set) form a system of representatives for the quotient of Rn by some subgroup Γ (essentially the dual of Λ).},

The book is organized around central algorithmic techniques for designing approximation algorithms, including greedy and local search algorithms, dynamic programming, linear and semidefinite programming, and randomization. Each chapter in the first section is devoted to a single algorithmic technique applied to several different problems, with more sophisticated treatment in the second section. The book also covers methods for proving that optimization problems are hard to approximate.

Such cube packings can be described by cliques of an associated graph, which allow us to classify them in dimension \$d{\textbackslash}leq 4\$. For higher dimension, we use random methods for generating some examples. Such a cube packing is called \{{\textbackslash}em non-extendible\} if we cannot insert a cube in the complement of the packing. In dimension 3, there is a unique non-extendible cube packing with 4 cubes. We prove that \$d\$-dimensional cube packings with more than \$2{\textasciicircum}d-3\$ cubes can be extended to cube tilings. We also give a lower bound on the number \$N\$ of cubes of non-extendible cube packings. Given such a cube packing and \$z{\textbackslash}in {\textbackslash}ZZ{\textasciicircum}d\$, we denote by \$N\_z\$ the number of cubes inside the \${\textbackslash}4t\$-cube \$z+[0,4[{\textasciicircum}d\$ and call \{{\textbackslash}em second moment\} the average of \$N\_z{\textasciicircum}2\$. We prove that the regular tiling by cubes has maximal second moment and give a lower bound on the second moment of a cube packing in terms of its density and dimension.},

	abstract = {We consider tilings and packings of \${\textbackslash}RR{\textasciicircum}d\$ by integral translates of cubes \$[0,2[{\textasciicircum}d\$, which are \$4{\textbackslash}ZZ{\textasciicircum}d\$-periodic. Such cube packings can be described by cliques of an associated graph, which allow us to classify them in dimension \$d{\textbackslash}leq 4\$. For higher dimension, we use random methods for generating some examples. Such a cube packing is called \{{\textbackslash}em non-extendible\} if we cannot insert a cube in the complement of the packing. In dimension 3, there is a unique non-extendible cube packing with 4 cubes. We prove that \$d\$-dimensional cube packings with more than \$2{\textasciicircum}d-3\$ cubes can be extended to cube tilings. We also give a lower bound on the number \$N\$ of cubes of non-extendible cube packings. Given such a cube packing and \$z{\textbackslash}in {\textbackslash}ZZ{\textasciicircum}d\$, we denote by \$N\_z\$ the number of cubes inside the \${\textbackslash}4t\$-cube \$z+[0,4[{\textasciicircum}d\$ and call \{{\textbackslash}em second moment\} the average of \$N\_z{\textasciicircum}2\$. We prove that the regular tiling by cubes has maximal second moment and give a lower bound on the second moment of a cube packing in terms of its density and dimension.},

	abstract = {A theory of replicating tessellation of \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}n \$ is developed that simultaneously generalizes radix representation of integers and hexagonal addressing in computer science. The tiling aggregates tesselate Euclidean space so that the \$( m + 1 )\$st aggregate is, in turn, tiled by translates of the mth aggregate, for each m in exactly the same way. This induces a discrete hierarchical addressing systsem on \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}n \$. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of replicating tessellations are given, and an efficient algorithm is provided to determine whether or not a replicating tessellation is induced. It is shown that the generalized balanced ternary is replicating in all dimensions. Each replicating tessellation yields an associated self-replicating tiling with the following properties: (1) a single tile T tesselates \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}n \$ periodically and (2) there is a linear map A, such that \$A( T )\$ is tiled by translates of T. The boundary of T is often a fractal curve.},

	abstract = {We discuss coloring and partitioning questions related to Sperner's Lemma, originally motivated by an application in hardness of approximation. Informally, we call a partitioning of the \$(k-1)\$-dimensional simplex into \$k\$ parts, or a labeling of a lattice inside the simplex by \$k\$ colors, "Sperner-admissible" if color \$i\$ avoids the face opposite to vertex \$i\$. The questions we study are of the following flavor: What is the Sperner-admissible labeling/partitioning that makes the total area of the boundary between different colors/parts as small as possible? First, for a natural arrangement of "cells" in the simplex, we prove an optimal lower bound on the number of cells that must be non-monochromatic in any Sperner-admissible labeling. This lower bound is matched by a simple labeling where each vertex receives the minimum admissible color. Second, we show for this arrangement that in contrast to Sperner's Lemma, there is a Sperner-admissible labeling such that every cell contains at most \$4\$ colors. Finally, we prove a geometric variant of the first result: For any Sperner-admissible partition of the regular simplex, the total surface area of the boundary shared by at least two different parts is minimized by the Voronoi partition \$(A{\textasciicircum}*\_1,{\textbackslash}ldots,A{\textasciicircum}*\_k)\$ where \$A{\textasciicircum}*\_i\$ contains all the points whose closest vertex is \$i\$. We also discuss possible extensions of this result to general polytopes and some open questions.},

	abstract = {AbstractTwo cubical versions of Sperner's lemma, due to Kuhn and Fan, are proved constructively without resorting to a simplicial decomposition of the cube, presenting examples of generalized complementary pivoting discussed by Todd (Math. Programming 6 (1974)). The first version is essentially equivalent to Sperner's lemma in that it implies Brouwer's fixed point theorem, thereby answering a question raised by Kuhn (IBM J. Res. Develop. 4 (1960)). The second has the property that although the structure is that of generalized complementarity, there is a uniquely defined path or algorithm associated with it. The basic structure used is a cubical decomposition of the cube, a special case of a cubical pseudomanifold, presented by Fan (Arch. Math. 11 (1960)). Given the existence of a constructive algorithm for Sperner's lemma (see Cohen, J. Combinatorial Theory 2 (1967)) and its generalization by Fan J. Combinatorial Theory 2 (1967)) allied to the large amount of recent progress in complementary pivot theory, resulting in particular from the works of Lemke (Manage. Sci. 11 (1965)) and Scarf (“The Computation of Economic Equilibria”) the computational attractions of a simplicial decomposition have become apparent. However, a cubical decomposition leads to certain advantages when a search for more than one “completely labeled” region is required, and no simplicial construction for the Fan lemma is known},

	abstract = {Let \$P\$ and \$Q\$ be polytopes, the first of  “low” dimension and the second of“high” dimension. We show how to triangulate the product \$P {\textbackslash}times Q\$efficiently (i.e., with few simplices) starting with a given triangulation of\$Q\$. Our method has a computational part, where we need to compute anefficient triangulation of \$P {\textbackslash}times {\textbackslash}Delta{\textasciicircum}m\$, for a (small) natural number \$m\$of our choice. \${\textbackslash}Delta{\textasciicircum}m\$ denotes the \$m\$-simplex.Our procedure can be applied to obtain (asymptotically) efficienttriangulations of the cube \$I{\textasciicircum}n\$: We decompose \$I{\textasciicircum}n = I{\textasciicircum}k {\textbackslash}times I{\textasciicircum}\{n-k\}\$, fora small \$k\$. Then we recursively assume we have obtained an efficienttriangulation of the second factor and use our method to triangulate theproduct. The outcome is that using \$k=3\$ and \$m=2\$, we can triangulate \$I{\textasciicircum}n\$with \$O(0.816{\textasciicircum}\{n\} n!)\$ simplices, instead of the \$O(0.840{\textasciicircum}\{n\} n!)\$ achievablebefore.},

Yet most such problems are NP-hard; unless P = NP, there are no efficient algorithms to find optimal solutions. This book shows how to design approximation algorithms: efficient algorithms that find provably near-optimal solutions. The book is organized around central algorithmic techniques for designing approximation algorithms, including greedy and local search algorithms, dynamic programming, linear and semidefinite programming, and randomization. Each chapter in the first section is devoted to a single algorithmic technique applied to several different problems, with more sophisticated treatment in the second section. The book also covers methods for proving that optimization problems are hard to approximate. Designed as a textbook for graduate-level algorithm courses, it will also serve as a reference for researchers interested in the heuristic solution of discrete optimization problems.},

Multi-pseudodeterministic algorithms relax the former notion by allowing the algorithms to output one of a bounded number of canonical solutions (per each input). We show that eﬃcient multi-pseudodeterministic algorithms can solve natural problems that are not solveable by eﬃcient pseudodeterministic algorithms, present a composition theorem regarding multi-pseudodeterministic algorithms, and relate them to other known notions.},

This new edition of the widely used analysis book continues to cover real analysis in greater detail and at a more advanced level than most books on the subject. Encompassing several subjects that underlie much of modern analysis, the book focuses on measure and integration theory, point set topology, and the basics of functional analysis. It illustrates the use of the general theories and introduces readers to other branches of analysis such as Fourier analysis, distribution theory, and probability theory.  This edition is bolstered in content as well as in scope-extending its usefulness to students outside of pure analysis as well as those interested in dynamical systems. The numerous exercises, extensive bibliography, and review chapter on sets and metric spaces make Real Analysis: Modern Techniques and Their Applications, Second Edition invaluable for students in graduate-level analysis courses. New features include: * Revised material on the n-dimensional Lebesgue integral. * An improved proof of Tychonoff's theorem. * Expanded material on Fourier analysis. * A newly written chapter devoted to distributions and differential equations. * Updated material on Hausdorff dimension and fractal dimension.},

Such cube packings can be described by cliques of an associated graph, which allow us to classify them in dimension \$d{\textbackslash}leq 4\$. For higher dimension, we use random methods for generating some examples. Such a cube packing is called \{{\textbackslash}em non-extendible\} if we cannot insert a cube in the complement of the packing. In dimension 3, there is a unique non-extendible cube packing with 4 cubes. We prove that \$d\$-dimensional cube packings with more than \$2{\textasciicircum}d-3\$ cubes can be extended to cube tilings. We also give a lower bound on the number \$N\$ of cubes of non-extendible cube packings. Given such a cube packing and \$z{\textbackslash}in {\textbackslash}ZZ{\textasciicircum}d\$, we denote by \$N\_z\$ the number of cubes inside the \${\textbackslash}4t\$-cube \$z+[0,4[{\textasciicircum}d\$ and call \{{\textbackslash}em second moment\} the average of \$N\_z{\textasciicircum}2\$. We prove that the regular tiling by cubes has maximal second moment and give a lower bound on the second moment of a cube packing in terms of its density and dimension.},

The tiling aggregates tesselate Euclidean space so that the \$( m + 1 )\$st aggregate is, in turn, tiled by translates of the mth aggregate, for each m in exactly the same way. This induces a discrete hierarchical addressing systsem on \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}n \$. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of replicating tessellations are given, and an efficient algorithm is provided to determine whether or not a replicating tessellation is induced. It is shown that the generalized balanced ternary is replicating in all dimensions. Each replicating tessellation yields an associated self-replicating tiling with the following properties: (1) a single tile T tesselates \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}n \$ periodically and (2) there is a linear map A, such that \$A( T )\$ is tiled by translates of T. The boundary of T is often a fractal curve.},

	abstract = {We discuss coloring and partitioning questions related to Sperner's Lemma, originally motivated by an application in hardness of approximation. Informally, we call a partitioning of the \$(k-1)\$-dimensional simplex into \$k\$ parts, or a labeling of a lattice inside the simplex by \$k\$ colors, "Sperner-admissible" if color \$i\$ avoids the face opposite to vertex \$i\$. The questions we study are of the following flavor: What is the Sperner-admissible labeling/partitioning that makes the total area of the boundary between different colors/parts as small as possible? First, for a natural arrangement of "cells" in the simplex, we prove an optimal lower bound on the number of cells that must be non-monochromatic in any Sperner-admissible labeling. This lower bound is matched by a simple labeling where each vertex receives the minimum admissible color. Second, we show for this arrangement that in contrast to Sperner's Lemma, there is a Sperner-admissible labeling such that every cell contains at most \$4\$ colors. Finally, we prove a geometric variant of the first result: For any Sperner-admissible partition of the regular simplex, the total surface area of the boundary shared by at least two different parts is minimized by the Voronoi partition \$(A{\textasciicircum}*\_1,{\textbackslash}ldots,A{\textasciicircum}*\_k)\$ where \$A{\textasciicircum}*\_i\$ contains all the points whose closest vertex is \$i\$. We also discuss possible extensions of this result to general polytopes and some open questions.},

	abstract = {AbstractTwo cubical versions of Sperner's lemma, due to Kuhn and Fan, are proved constructively without resorting to a simplicial decomposition of the cube, presenting examples of generalized complementary pivoting discussed by Todd (Math. Programming 6 (1974)). The first version is essentially equivalent to Sperner's lemma in that it implies Brouwer's fixed point theorem, thereby answering a question raised by Kuhn (IBM J. Res. Develop. 4 (1960)). The second has the property that although the structure is that of generalized complementarity, there is a uniquely defined path or algorithm associated with it. The basic structure used is a cubical decomposition of the cube, a special case of a cubical pseudomanifold, presented by Fan (Arch. Math. 11 (1960)). Given the existence of a constructive algorithm for Sperner's lemma (see Cohen, J. Combinatorial Theory 2 (1967)) and its generalization by Fan J. Combinatorial Theory 2 (1967)) allied to the large amount of recent progress in complementary pivot theory, resulting in particular from the works of Lemke (Manage. Sci. 11 (1965)) and Scarf (“The Computation of Economic Equilibria”) the computational attractions of a simplicial decomposition have become apparent. However, a cubical decomposition leads to certain advantages when a search for more than one “completely labeled” region is required, and no simplicial construction for the Fan lemma is known},

	abstract = {In geometry, Keller's conjecture is the conjecture that in any tiling of n-dimensional Euclidean space by identical hypercubes, there are two hypercubes that share an entire (n − 1)-dimensional face with each other. For instance, in any tiling of the plane by identical squares, some two squares must share an entire edge, as they do in the illustration.
This conjecture was introduced by Ott-Heinrich Keller (1930), after whom it is named. A breakthrough by Lagarias and  Shor (1992) showed that it is false in ten or more dimensions, and after subsequent refinements, it is now known to be true in spaces of dimension at most seven and false in all higher dimensions. The proofs of these results use a reformulation of the problem in terms of the clique number of certain graphs now known as Keller graphs.
The related Minkowski lattice cube-tiling conjecture states that whenever a tiling of space by identical cubes has the additional property that the cubes' centers form a lattice, some cubes must meet face-to-face. It was proved by György Hajós in 1942.
Szabó (1993), Shor (2004), and Zong (2005) give surveys of work on Keller's conjecture and related problems.},

Rédei later proved the statement when the factors are only required to contain the identity element and be of prime cardinality. Rédei's proof of Hajós's theorem was simplified by Tibor Szele.

An equivalent statement on homogeneous linear forms was originally conjectured by Hermann Minkowski. A consequence is Minkowski's conjecture on lattice tilings, which says that in any lattice tiling of space by cubes, there are two cubes that meet face to face. Keller's conjecture is the same conjecture for non-lattice tilings, which turns out to be false in high dimensions.},

We show how to triangulate the product \$P {\textbackslash}times Q\$efficiently (i.e., with few simplices) starting with a given triangulation of\$Q\$. Our method has a computational part, where we need to compute anefficient triangulation of \$P {\textbackslash}times {\textbackslash}Delta{\textasciicircum}m\$, for a (small) natural number \$m\$of our choice. \${\textbackslash}Delta{\textasciicircum}m\$ denotes the \$m\$-simplex.Our procedure can be applied to obtain (asymptotically) efficienttriangulations of the cube \$I{\textasciicircum}n\$: We decompose \$I{\textasciicircum}n = I{\textasciicircum}k {\textbackslash}times I{\textasciicircum}\{n-k\}\$, fora small \$k\$. Then we recursively assume we have obtained an efficienttriangulation of the second factor and use our method to triangulate theproduct. The outcome is that using \$k=3\$ and \$m=2\$, we can triangulate \$I{\textasciicircum}n\$with \$O(0.816{\textasciicircum}\{n\} n!)\$ simplices, instead of the \$O(0.840{\textasciicircum}\{n\} n!)\$ achievablebefore.},

	abstract = {A cube tiling of \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}d\$ is a family of pairwise disjoint cubes \$[0,1){\textasciicircum}d+T={\textbackslash}\{[0,1){\textasciicircum}d+t{\textbackslash}colon t{\textbackslash}in T{\textbackslash}\}\$ such that \${\textbackslash}bigcup\_\{t{\textbackslash}in T\}([0,1){\textasciicircum}d+t)={\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}d\$. Two cubes \$[0,1){\textasciicircum}d+t\$, \$[0,1){\textasciicircum}d+s\$ are called a twin pair if \${\textbar}t\_j-s\_j{\textbar}=1\$ for some \$j{\textbackslash}in [d]={\textbackslash}\{1,{\textbackslash}ldots, d{\textbackslash}\}\$ and \$t\_i=s\_i\$ for every \$i{\textbackslash}in [d]{\textbackslash}setminus {\textbackslash}\{j{\textbackslash}\}\$. In \$1930\$, Keller conjectured that in every cube tiling of \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}d\$ there is a twin pair. Keller's conjecture is true for dimensions \$d{\textbackslash}leq 6\$ and false for all dimensions \$d{\textbackslash}geq 8\$. For \$d=7\$ the conjecture is still open. Let \$x{\textbackslash}in {\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}d\$, \$i{\textbackslash}in [d]\$, and let \$L(T,x,i)\$ be the set of all \$i\$th coordinates \$t\_i\$ of vectors \$t{\textbackslash}in T\$ such that \$([0,1){\textasciicircum}d+t){\textbackslash}cap ([0,1]{\textasciicircum}d+x){\textbackslash}neq {\textbackslash}emptyset\$ and \$t\_i{\textbackslash}leq x\_i\$.

It is known that if \$r{\textasciicircum}-(T){\textbackslash}leq 2\$ or \$r{\textasciicircum}+(T){\textbackslash}geq 5\$, then Keller's conjecture is true for \$d=7\$. In the paper we show that it is also true for \$d=7\$ if \$r{\textasciicircum}+(T)=4\$. Thus, if \$[0,1){\textasciicircum}7+T\$ is a counterexample to Keller's conjecture, then \$r{\textasciicircum}+(T)=3\$, which is the last unsolved case of Keller's conjecture. Additionally, a new proof of Keller's conjecture in dimensions \$d{\textbackslash}leq 6\$ is given.},

The conjecture is false for this dimension if and only if at least one of the graphs contains a clique of size \$2{\textasciicircum}7 = 128\$. We present an automated method to solve this conjecture by encoding the existence of such a clique as a propositional formula. We apply satisfiability solving combined with symmetry-breaking techniques to determine that no such clique exists. This result implies that every unit cube tiling of \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}7\$ contains a facesharing pair of cubes. Since a faceshare-free unit cube tiling of \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}8\$ exists (which we also verify), this completely resolves Keller's conjecture.},

If it is required, in addition, that the unitary groups generated by H1,…, Hn act multiplicatively on L2(Ω), then this is shown to correspond to the requirement that Λ can be chosen as a subgroup of the additive group Rn. The measurable sets Ω ⊂Rn (of finite Lebesgue measure) for which there exists a subgroup Λ ⊂Rn as stated are precisely those measurable sets which (after a correction by a null set) form a system of representatives for the quotient of Rn by some subgroup Γ (essentially the dual of Λ).},

In fact, as one will see from this survey, they are not simple at all. On the one hand, the known results about them have been achieved by employing complicated machineries from Number Theory, Group Theory, Probability Theory, Matrix Theory, Hyperbolic Geometry, Combinatorics, etc.; on the other hand, the answers for many basic problems about them are still missing. In addition, the geometry of unit cubes does serve as a meeting point for several applied subjects such as Design Theory, Coding Theory, etc. The purpose of this article is to figure out what is known about the unit cubes and what do we want to know about them.},

	abstract = {Suppose \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{Est\}\$ is a randomized estimation algorithm that uses \$n\$ random bits and outputs values in \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}d\$. We show how to execute \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{Est\}\$ on \$k\$ adaptively chosen inputs using only \$n + O(k {\textbackslash}log(d + 1))\$ random bits instead of the trivial \$nk\$ (at the cost of mild increases in the error and failure probability). Our algorithm combines a variant of the INW pseudorandom generator (STOC '94) with a new scheme for shifting and rounding the outputs of \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{Est\}\$. We prove that modifying the outputs of \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{Est\}\$ is necessary in this setting, and furthermore, our algorithm's randomness complexity is near-optimal in the case \$d {\textbackslash}leq O(1)\$. As an application, we give a randomness-efficient version of the Goldreich-Levin algorithm; our algorithm finds all Fourier coefficients with absolute value at least \${\textbackslash}theta\$ of a function \$F: {\textbackslash}\{0, 1{\textbackslash}\}{\textasciicircum}n {\textbackslash}to {\textbackslash}\{-1, 1{\textbackslash}\}\$ using \$O(n {\textbackslash}log n) {\textbackslash}cdot {\textbackslash}text\{poly\}(1/{\textbackslash}theta)\$ queries to \$F\$ and \$O(n)\$ random bits (independent of \${\textbackslash}theta\$), improving previous work by Bshouty et al.

We investigate the case where one unit-volume bubble is required to tile d-dimensional space in a periodic fashion according to the standard, cubical lattice. While a cube requires surface area 2d, we construct such a bubble having surface area very close to that of a sphere; i.e., proportional to d (the minimum possible even without the periodicity constraint). Our method for constructing this ―spherical cube‖ has a surprising inspiration: foundational questions in the theory of computation—specifically the issue of ―hardness amplification.‖ We additionally show an algorithmic application of our new foam: a method for ―coordinated discretization‖ of high-dimensional data points which has near-optimal resistance to noise. Finally, we provide the most efficient known cubical foam in 3 dimensions.},
