abstract = {The betweenness centrality of a graph vertex measures how often this vertex is visited on shortest paths between other vertices of the graph. In the analysis of many real-world graphs or networks, betweenness centrality of a vertex is used as an indicator for its relative importance in the network. In recent years, a growing number of real-world networks is modeled as temporal graphs instead of conventional (static) graphs. In a temporal graph, we have a fixed set of vertices and there is a finite discrete set of time steps and every edge might be present only at some time steps. While shortest paths are straightforward to define in static graphs, temporal paths can be considered "optimal" with respect to many different criteria, including length, arrival time, and overall travel time (shortest, foremost, and fastest paths). This leads to different concepts of temporal betweenness centrality, posing new challenges on the algorithmic side. We provide a systematic study of temporal betweenness variants based on various concepts of optimal temporal paths both on a theoretical and empirical level.},

abstract = {Complex networks are ubiquitous to several computer science domains. Centrality measures are an important analysis mechanism to uncover vital elements of complex networks. However, these metrics have high computational costs and requirements that hinder their applications in large real-world networks. In this tutorial, we explain how the use of neural network learning algorithms can render the application of the metrics in complex networks of arbitrary size. Moreover, the tutorial describes how to identify the best configuration for neural network training and learning such for tasks, besides presenting an easy way to generate and acquire training data. We do so by means of a general methodology, using complex network models adaptable to any application. We show that a regression model generated by the neural network successfully approximates the metric values and therefore is a robust, effective alternative in real-world applications. The methodology and proposed machine-learning model use only a fraction of time with respect to other approximation algorithms, which is crucial in complex network applications.},

    abstract = "Recent research has highlighted limitations of studying complex systems with time-varying topologies from the perspective of static, time-aggregated networks. Non-Markovian characteristics resulting from the ordering of interactions in temporal networks were identified as one important mechanism that alters causality and affects dynamical processes. So far, an analytical explanation for this phenomenon and for the significant variations observed across different systems is missing. Here we introduce a methodology that allows to analytically predict causality-driven changes of diffusion speed in non-Markovian temporal networks. Validating our predictions in six data sets we show that compared with the time-aggregated network, non-Markovian characteristics can lead to both a slow-down or speed-up of diffusion, which can even outweigh the decelerating effect of community structures in the static topology. Thus, non-Markovian properties of temporal networks constitute an important additional dimension of complexity in time-varying complex systems.",

abstract = {In this work, we present a method for node embedding in temporal graphs. We propose an algorithm that learns the evolution of a temporal graph's nodes and edges over time and incorporates this dynamics in a temporal node embedding framework for different graph prediction tasks. We present a joint loss function that creates a temporal embedding of a node by learning to combine its historical temporal embeddings, such that it optimizes per given task (e.g., link prediction). The algorithm is initialized using static node embeddings, which are then aligned over the representations of a node at different time points, and eventually adapted for the given task in a joint optimization. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach over a variety of temporal graphs for the two fundamental tasks of temporal link prediction and multilabel node classification, comparing to competitive baselines and algorithmic alternatives. Our algorithm shows performance improvements across many of the datasets and baselines and is found particularly effective for graphs that are less cohesive, with a lower clustering coefficient.},

    abstract = { Complex systems, composed at the most basic level of units and their interactions, describe phenomena in a wide variety of domains, from neuroscience to computer science and economics. The wide variety of applications has resulted in two key challenges: the generation of many domain-specific strategies for complex systems analyses that are seldom revisited, and the compartmentalization of representation and analysis ideas within a domain due to inconsistency in complex systems language. In this work we propose basic, domain-agnostic language in order to advance toward a more cohesive vocabulary. We use this language to evaluate each step of the complex systems analysis pipeline, beginning with the system under study and data collected, then moving through different mathematical frameworks for encoding the observed data (i.e., graphs, simplicial complexes, and hypergraphs), and relevant computational methods for each framework. At each step we consider different types of dependencies; these are properties of the system that describe how the existence of an interaction among a set of units in a system may affect the possibility of the existence of another relation. We discuss how dependencies may arise and how they may alter the interpretation of results or the entirety of the analysis pipeline. We close with two real-world examples using coauthorship data and email communications data that illustrate how the system under study, the dependencies therein, the research question, and the choice of mathematical representation influence the results. We hope this work can serve as an opportunity for reflection for experienced complex systems scientists, as well as an introductory resource for new researchers. }
