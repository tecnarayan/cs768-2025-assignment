abstract = "The problem of achieving conjunctive goals has been central to domain-independent planning research; the nonlinear constraint-posting approach has been most successful. Previous planners of this type have been complicated, heuristic, and ill-defined. I have combined and distilled the state of the art into a simple, precise, implemented algorithm (TWEAK) which I have proved correct and complete. I analyze previous work on domain-independent conjunctive planning; in retrospect it becomes clear that all conjunctive planners, linear and nonlinear, work the same way. The efficiency and correctness of these planners depends on the traditional add/delete-list representation for actions, which drastically limits their usefulness. I present theorems that suggest that efficient general purpose planning with more expressive action representations is impossible, and suggest ways to avoid this problem."

abstract = {Summary This chapter focuses on team mental models (TMM) (shared, organized understanding of teamwork and taskwork knowledge) and team situation awareness (TSA, shared knowledge about current and future environmental events) because both capture unique aspects of team cognition, and derive from distinct literatures and methodologies. It provides an integrative review across TMM and situation awareness domains, answering the call for greater synthesis across team cognition constructs. After providing a brief overview of team cognition, TMMs and situation awareness, the chapter presents an integrative framework and identifies future research needs. As a multidimensional construct, team cognition comprises many specific exemplars, and the authors chose to focus on TMM and situation awareness, which emphasize knowledge content. To avoid redundancy with comprehensive reviews of the research on TMMs and situation awareness, the individual coverage of each construct emphasizes current research.}

  TITLE={PTIME: Personalized assistance for calendaring},
  JOURNAL={ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology},

  ABSTRACT={In a world of electronic calendars, the prospect of intelligent, personalized
     time management assistance seems a plausible and desirable application of AI.
     PTIME (Personalized Time Management) is a learning cognitive assistant agent
     that helps users handle email meeting requests, reserve venues, and schedule
     events. PTIME is designed to unobtrusively learn scheduling preferences, adapting
     to its user over time. The agent allows its user to flexibly express requirements
     for new meetings, as they would to an assistant. It interfaces with commercial
     enterprise calendaring platforms, and it operates seamlessly with users who
     do not have PTIME. This article overviews the system design and describes the
     models and technical advances required to satisfy the competing needs of preference
     modeling and elicitation, constraint reasoning, and machine learning. We further
     report on a multifaceted evaluation of the perceived usefulness of the system.}

abstract = {Reaching a consensus on the team plans is vital to human-AI coordination. We suggest incorporating external models to assist humans in understanding the intentions of AI agents when the AI has no explainable plan to communicate. In this paper, we propose a two-stage paradigm that first trains a Theory of Mind (ToM) model from collected offline trajectories of the target agent and utilizes the model in the process of human-AI collaboration by real-timely displaying the future action predictions of the target agent. We further implement a transformer-based predictor as the ToM model and develop an extended online human-AI collaboration platform for experiments. Experimental results validate that our ToM model can significantly improve team performance, demonstrating the potential of our paradigm in human-AI collaboration.},

abstract = {The development of human-robot systems able to leverage the strengths of both humans and their robotic counterparts has been greatly sought after because of the foreseen, broad-ranging impact across industry and research. We believe the true potential of these systems cannot be reached unless the robot is able to act with a high level of autonomy, reducing the burden of manual tasking or teleoperation. To achieve this level of autonomy, robots must be able to work fluidly with its human partners, inferring their needs without explicit commands. This inference requires the robot to be able to detect and classify the heterogeneity of its partners. We propose a framework for learning from heterogeneous demonstration based upon Bayesian inference and evaluate a suite of approaches on a real-world dataset of gameplay from StarCraft II. This evaluation provides evidence that our Bayesian approach can outperform conventional methods by up to 12.8\%.},
