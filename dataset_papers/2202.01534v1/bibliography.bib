% NIPS years are wierd... 

% For instance, let's examine NIPS24, this is NIPS 2011, as correctly stated on http://papers.nips.cc/
% However, http://nips.cc/Conferences/2011/ mentions that it is the
%  "Twenty-Fifth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems" 
% in fact, it is the 25th meeting, but proceedings of first meeting are called different 
% -> so "Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 24"!
%
% this is verifyable by comparint the paper lists:
% http://nips.cc/Conferences/2011/Program/accepted-papers.php
% http://papers.nips.cc/book/advances-in-neural-information-processing-systems-24-2011
%
% boils down to: trust http://papers.nips.cc/ and don't get distracted by "the x-th conference"

% NIPS years are wierd... 

% For instance, let's examine NIPS24, this is NIPS 2011, as correctly stated on http://papers.nips.cc/
% However, http://nips.cc/Conferences/2011/ mentions that it is the
%  "Twenty-Fifth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems" 
% in fact, it is the 25th meeting, but proceedings of first meeting are called different 
% -> so "Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 24"!
%
% this is verifyable by comparint the paper lists:
% http://nips.cc/Conferences/2011/Program/accepted-papers.php
% http://papers.nips.cc/book/advances-in-neural-information-processing-systems-24-2011
%
% boils down to: trust http://papers.nips.cc/ and don't get distracted by "the x-th conference"

The states of this internal process are not directly observable by the controller; rather, he has available a set of observable outputs that are only probabilistically related to the internal state of the system. The formulation is illustrated by a simple machine-maintenance example, and other specific application areas are also discussed. The paper demonstrates that, if there are only a finite number of control intervals remaining, then the optimal payoff function is a piecewise-linear, convex function of the current state probabilities of the internal Markov process. In addition, an algorithm for utilizing this property to calculate the optimal control policy and payoff function for any finite horizon is outlined. These results are illustrated by a numerical example for the machine-maintenance problem.},

The optimization approach for these partially observable Markov processes is a generalization of the well-known policy iteration technique for finding optimal stationary policies for completely observable Markov processes. The state space for the problem is the space of state occupancy probability distributions (the unit simplex). The development of the algorithm introduces several new ideas, including the class of finitely transient policies, which are shown to possess piecewise linear cost functions. The paper develops easily implemented approximations to stationary policies based on these finitely transient policies and shows that the concave hull of an approximation can be included in the well-known Howard policy improvement algorithm with subsequent convergence. The paper closes with a detailed example illustrating the application of the algorithm to the two-state partially observable Markov process.},

Specifically, our motivating hypothesis is that to deal with dynamic and unpredictable environments it is important to have agents that learn the right situations in which to attempt coordination and the right coordination method to use in those situations. In particular, the efficacy of learning is evaluated when agents have varying types and amounts of information when those coordinating decisions are taken. This hypothesis is evaluated empirically, in a grid-world scenario in which a) an agent?s predictions about the other agents in the environment are approximately correct and b) an agent cannot correctly predict the others?
behaviour. The results presented show when, where and why learning is effective when it comes to making a decision about selecting a coordination mechanism.}

@article{Beard06IEEE,
    abstract = {{Numerous applications require aerial surveillance. Civilian applications include monitoring forest fires, oil fields, and pipelines and tracking wildlife. Applications to homeland security include border patrol and monitoring the perimeter of nuclear power plants. Military applications are numerous. The current approach to these applications is to use a single manned vehicle for surveillance. However, manned vehicles are typically large and expensive. In addition, hazardous environments and operator fatigue can potentially threaten the life of the pilot. Therefore, there is a critical need for automating aerial surveillance using unmanned air vehicles (UAVs). This paper gives an overview of a cooperative control strategy for aerial surveillance that has been successfully flight tested on small (48-in wingspan) UAVs. Our approach to cooperative control problems can be summarized in four steps: 1) the definition of a cooperation constraint and cooperation objective; 2) the definition of a coordination variable as the minimal amount of information needed to effect cooperation; 3) the design of a centralized cooperation strategy; and 4) the use of consensus schemes to transform the centralized strategy into a decentralized algorithm. The effectiveness of the solution will be shown using both high-fidelity simulation and actual flight tests.}},

    abstract = { Solving the SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) problem is one way to enable a robot to explore, map, and navigate in a previously unknown environment. Smoothing approaches have been investigated as a viable alternative to extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based solutions to the problem. In particular, approaches have been looked at that factorize either the associated information matrix or the measurement Jacobian into square root form. Such techniques have several significant advantages over the EKF: they are faster yet exact; they can be used in either batch or incremental mode; are better equipped to deal with non-linear process and measurement models; and yield the entire robot trajectory, at lower cost for a large class of SLAM problems. In addition, in an indirect but dramatic way, column ordering heuristics automatically exploit the locality inherent in the geographic nature of the SLAM problem. This paper presents the theory underlying these methods, along with an interpretation of factorization in terms of the graphical model associated with the SLAM problem. Both simulation results and actual SLAM experiments in large-scale environments are presented that underscore the potential of these methods as an alternative to EKF-based approaches. }

    abstract = {In theory, a comparison of two experimental effects requires a statistical test on their difference. In practice, this comparison is often based on an incorrect procedure involving two separate tests in which researchers conclude that effects differ when one effect is significant (P < 0.05) but the other is not (P > 0.05). We reviewed 513 behavioral, systems and cognitive neuroscience articles in five top-ranking journals (Science, Nature, Nature Neuroscience, Neuron and The Journal of Neuroscience) and found that 78 used the correct procedure and 79 used the incorrect procedure. An additional analysis suggests that incorrect analyses of interactions are even more common in cellular and molecular neuroscience. We discuss scenarios in which the erroneous procedure is particularly beguiling.},

To meet this challenge, we first introduce a novel continuous-time DEC-MDP model that exploits transition independence in domains with temporal constraints. Moreimportantly, we present a new locally optimal algorithm called SPAC. Compared to the best previous algorithm, SPAC finds solutions of comparable quality substantially faster; SPAC also scales to larger teams of agents.},

    abstract ={The partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) provides a principled mathematical model for integrating perception and planning, a major challenge in robotics. While there are efficient algorithms for moderately large discrete POMDPs, continuous models are often more natural for robotic tasks, and currently there are no practical algorithms that handle continuous POMDPs at an interesting scale. This paper presents an algorithm for continuous-state, continuous-observation POMDPs. We provide experimental results demonstrating its potential in robot planning and learning under uncertainty and a theoretical analysis of its performance. A direct benefit of the algorithm is to simplify model construction.},

To learn the parameters of such policies we develop connections between black box variational inference and existing policy search approaches.  We then explain how such learning can be implemented in a probabilistic programming system.  Using our own novel implementation of such a system we demonstrate both conciseness of policy representation and automatic policy parameter learning for a set of canonical reinforcement learning problems.}

  abstract = 	 {We propose a new reinforcement learning algorithm for partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP) based on spectral decomposition methods. While spectral methods have been previously employed for consistent learning of (passive) latent variable models such as hidden Markov models, POMDPs are more challenging  since the learner interacts with the environment and possibly changes the future observations in the process. We devise a learning algorithm running through episodes, in each episode we employ spectral techniques to learn the POMDP parameters from a trajectory generated by a fixed policy. At the end of the episode, an optimization oracle returns the optimal memoryless planning policy which maximizes the expected reward based on the estimated POMDP model. We prove an order-optimal regret bound w.r.t. the optimal memoryless policy and efficient scaling with respect to the dimensionality of observation and action spaces.}

  abstract = 	 {Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been successfully applied to the problem of \emph{policy imitation} in a model-free setup. However, the computation graph of GANs, that include a stochastic policy as the generative model, is no longer differentiable end-to-end, which requires the use of high-variance gradient estimation. In this paper, we introduce the Model-based Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (MGAIL) algorithm. We show how to use a forward model to make the computation fully differentiable, which enables training policies using the exact gradient of the discriminator. The resulting algorithm trains competent policies using relatively fewer expert samples and interactions with the environment. We test it on both discrete and continuous action domains and report results that surpass the state-of-the-art.}

		the world and learn good behaviors. In many real world tasks,
		this exploration can take far too long, and the agent must make
		decisions about which states to explore, and which states not
		to explore. Bayesian methods attempt to address this problem,
		but take too much computation time to run in reasonably sized
		domains. In this paper, we present TEXPLORE, the first algorithm
		to perform targeted exploration in real time in large domains.
		The algorithm learns multiple possible models of the domain
		that generalize action effects across states. We experiment with
		possible ways of adding intrinsic motivation to the agent to drive
		exploration. TEXPLORE is fully implemented and tested in a novel
		domain called Fuel World that is designed to reflect the type of
		targeted exploration needed in the real world. We show that
		our algorithm significantly outperforms representative examples
		of both model-free and model-based RL algorithms from the
		literature and is able to quickly learn to perform well in a large
		world in real-time.",

abstract="The use of robots in society could be expanded by using reinforcement learning (RL) to allow robots to learn and adapt to new situations online. RL is a paradigm for learning sequential decision making tasks, usually formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). For an RL algorithm to be practical for robotic control tasks, it must learn in very few samples, while continually taking actions in real-time. In addition, the algorithm must learn efficiently in the face of noise, sensor/actuator delays, and continuous state features. In this article, we present texplore, the first algorithm to address all of these challenges together. texplore is a model-based RL method that learns a random forest model of the domain which generalizes dynamics to unseen states. The agent explores states that are promising for the final policy, while ignoring states that do not appear promising. With sample-based planning and a novel parallel architecture, texplore can select actions continually in real-time whenever necessary. We empirically evaluate the importance of each component of texplore in isolation and then demonstrate the complete algorithm learning to control the velocity of an autonomous vehicle in real-time.",

  abstract = {Partially-Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) are a problem class with
      significant applicability to robotics when considering the uncertainty present in the real
      world, however, they quickly become intractable for large state and action spaces. A method
      to create a less complex but accurate action model approximation is proposed and evaluated
      using a state-of-the-art POMDP solver. We apply this general and powerful formulation to a
      robotic navigation task under state and sensing uncertainty. Results show that this method
      can provide a useful action model that yields a policy with similar overall expected reward
      compared to the true action model, often with significant computational savings. In some
      cases, our reduced complexity model can solve problems where the true model is too complex
      to find a policy that accomplishes the task. We conclude that this technique of building
      problem-dependent approximations can provide significant computational advantages and can
      help expand the complexity of problems that can be considered using current POMDP
      techniques.},
