  abstract = 	 {One of the most natural and important questions in statistical learning is: how well can a distribution be approximated from its samples. Surprisingly, this question has so far been resolved for only one loss, the KL-divergence and even in this case, the estimator used is ad hoc and not well understood. We study distribution approximations for general loss measures.  For \ell_2^2 we determine the best approximation possible, for \ell_1 and χ^2 we derive tight bounds on the best approximation, and when the probabilities are bounded away from zero, we resolve the question for all sufficiently smooth loss measures, thereby providing a coherent understanding of the rate at which distributions can be approximated from their samples.}

In these models, neither the subutility function of observable attributes nor the distribution of the unobservable random terms is specified parametrically. Sets of nonparametric functions that possess properties that are often implied by economic theory and satisfy the restrictions required to identify the models are described. We use the identification results to develop nonparametric strongly-consistent estimators for the subutility function of observable attributes. The results concern models in which the distribution of the unobservable random terms both depend and do not depend on the observable characteristics."

    abstract = 	 {Causal effect identification is the task of determining whether a causal distribution is computable from the combination of an observational distribution and substantive knowledge about the domain under investigation. One of the most studied versions of this problem assumes that knowledge is articulated in the form of a fully known causal diagram, which is arguably a strong assumption in many settings. In this paper, we relax this requirement and consider that the knowledge is articulated in the form of an equivalence class of causal diagrams, in particular, a partial ancestral graph (PAG). This is attractive because a PAG can be learned directly from data, and the scientist does not need to commit to a particular, unique diagram. There are different sufficient conditions for identification in PAGs, but none is complete. We derive a complete algorithm for identification given a PAG. This implies that whenever the causal effect is identifiable, the algorithm returns a valid identification expression; alternatively, it will throw a failure condition, which means that the effect is provably not identifiable. We further provide a graphical characterization of non-identifiability of causal effects in PAGs.}

In this paper we show that it can also be a powerful representational tool for a wide variety of causal hypotheses in such domains. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, as with Causal Bayesian Networks (CBNs), the identifiability of the effects of causal manipulations when observations of the system are incomplete can be verified simply by reference to the topology of the CEG. We close the paper with a proof of a Back Door Theorem for CEGs, analogous to Pearl's Back Door Theorem for CBNs."

Our focus is on causal identifiability — finding conditions for when the effects of a manipulation can be estimated from a subset of events observable in the unmanipulated system. CEG analogues of Pearlʼs Back Door and Front Door theorems are presented, applicable to the class of singular manipulations, which includes both Pearlʼs basic Do intervention and the class of functional manipulations possible on Bayesian Networks. These theorems are shown to be more flexible than their Bayesian Network counterparts, both in the types of manipulation to which they can be applied, and in the nature of the conditioning sets which can be used."
