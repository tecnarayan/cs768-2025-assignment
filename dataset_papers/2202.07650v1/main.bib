We create SciERC, a dataset that includes annotations for all three tasks and develop a unified framework called SciIE with shared span representations. The multi-task setup reduces cascading errors between tasks and leverages cross-sentence relations through coreference links. Experiments show that our multi-task model outperforms previous models in scientific information extraction without using any domain-specific features. We further show that the framework supports construction of a scientific knowledge graph, which we use to analyze information in scientific literature.",

The method, based on the ordered p-values of the individual tests, is less conservative than the classical Bonferroni procedure but is still simple to apply. A simulation study shows that the probability of a type I error of the procedure does not exceed the nominal significance level, α, for a variety of multivariate normal and multivariate gamma test statistics. For independent tests the procedure has type I error probability equal to α. The method appears particularly advantageous over the classical Bonferroni procedure when several highly-correlated test statistics are involved.}",

We prove that these special cases are indeed special, applying only to specific significance levels, and obtain a strong bound on the average deviation of the Simes corrected P-value from the true probability over any interval of P-values. From this, it is argued that Simes' procedure should be expected to perform well except for pathological examples.},
