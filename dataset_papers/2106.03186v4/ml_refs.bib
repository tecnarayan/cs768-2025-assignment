volume={10},
number={9},
pages={647-658},
abstract={Long-term, high-resolution imaging studies of neuronal structure in vivo have revealed that structural plasticity is an ongoing process in the adult brain of mammals, even under baseline conditions.The large-scale structure of cortical neurons, which consists of axonal and dendritic branches, is relatively stable under most conditions. By contrast, small synaptic structures, such as dendritic spines and axonal boutons are highly dynamic, displaying size changes and changes in cytoskeletal dynamics.Although most dendritic spines and axonal boutons are maintained over a large fraction of the animal's life, a subpopulation appears and disappears. For both spines and boutons the turnover is balanced, leaving the total density unchanged under baseline conditions.The sizes of spines and synapses are maintained and regulated through dynamic interactions between their molecular constituents, which are dymaically re-allocated among synapses.New spines are mostly transient. They rarely turn into persistent spines. Persistent spines always bear synapses.Changes in sensory experience and learning cause the stabilization of new spines in cortical areas that display functional changes, indicating that synapse formation and elimination probably contribute to experience-dependent rewiring of cortical circuits.Structural plasticity might have a role in functional network alterations in neurodegenerative and memory disorders, and may also underlie spontaneous recovery of function after local brain injury and peripheral nerve lesions.},
