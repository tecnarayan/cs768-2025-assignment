However, with the advent of affordable 3D acquisition technology and the growing popularity of 3D content, its relevance is steadily increasing. Just as in the 2D case, 3D data is often partial, noisy and without prior segmentation. Moreover, the object is rarely observed in a canonical frame of reference with respect to orientation (or scale). We propose a method, using Hough-voting for local 3D features, which is orientation (and scale) invariant.},
