Choosing the optimizer is considered to be among the most crucial design
decisions in deep learning, and it is not an easy one. The growing literature
now lists hundreds of optimization methods. In the absence of clear theoretical
guidance and conclusive empirical evidence, the decision is often made based on
anecdotes. In this work, we aim to replace these anecdotes, if not with a
conclusive ranking, then at least with evidence-backed heuristics. To do so, we
perform an extensive, standardized benchmark of fifteen particularly popular
deep learning optimizers while giving a concise overview of the wide range of
possible choices. Analyzing more than $50,000$ individual runs, we contribute
the following three points: (i) Optimizer performance varies greatly across
tasks. (ii) We observe that evaluating multiple optimizers with default
parameters works approximately as well as tuning the hyperparameters of a
single, fixed optimizer. (iii) While we cannot discern an optimization method
clearly dominating across all tested tasks, we identify a significantly reduced
subset of specific optimizers and parameter choices that generally lead to
competitive results in our experiments: Adam remains a strong contender, with
newer methods failing to significantly and consistently outperform it. Our
open-sourced results are available as challenging and well-tuned baselines for
more meaningful evaluations of novel optimization methods without requiring any
further computational efforts.
