	abstract = {In this paper we prove two theorems characterizing the radial sum of star bodies. By doing so we demonstrate an interesting phenomenon: essentially the same conditions, on two different spaces, can uniquely characterize very different operations. In our first theorem we characterize the radial sum by its induced homothety, and our list of assumptions is identical to the assumptions of the corresponding theorem which characterizes the Minkowski sum for convex bodies. In our second theorem give a different characterization from a short list of natural properties, without assuming the homothety has any specific form. For this theorem one has to add an assumption to the corresponding theorem for convex bodies, as we demonstrate by a simple example.},

We propose a sparse version of naive Bayes, which can be used for feature selection. This leads to a combinatorial maximum-likelihood problem, for which we provide an exact solution in the case of binary data, or a bound in the multinomial case. We prove that our bound becomes tight as the marginal contribution of additional features decreases. Both binary and multinomial sparse models are solvable in time almost linear in problem size, representing a very small extra relative cost compared to the classical naive Bayes. Numerical experiments on text data show that the naive Bayes feature selection method is as statistically effective as state-of-the-art feature selection methods such as recursive feature elimination, \$l\_1\$-penalized logistic regression and LASSO, while being orders of magnitude faster. For a large data set, having more than with \$1.6\$ million training points and about \$12\$ million features, and with a non-optimized CPU implementation, our sparse naive Bayes model can be trained in less than 15 seconds.},

Also we obtain a formula for the recession function of the marginal function for the first time. This formula seems to be important and new also in the finite dimensional case. The convex version of the stability result is used to reobtain formulae for the conjugates, ϵ-subdifferentials and recession functions of some convex functions, results which are comparable with those of McLinden. It is also shown that in some cases one can perturbe the objective function of a family of convex problems such that the resulting problems have optimal solutions; the behaviour of the values of these perturbed problems and their solutions is also investigated. Another result establishes the relationship between conically compact sets introduced by Isac and Théra and asymptotic cones.},

The system’s response f pushes forward ̺ to a new measure f ◦ ̺ which we would like to study. However, we might not have access to f , but to its approximation g. We thus arrive at a fundamental question – if f and g are close in Lq, does the measure g ◦ ̺ approximate f ◦ ̺ well, and in what sense? Previously, it was demonstrated that the answer to this question might be negative in terms of the Lp distance between probability density functions (PDF). Instead, we show in this paper that the Wasserstein metric is the proper framework for this question. We bound the Wasserstein distance Wp(f ◦ ̺, g ◦ ̺) from above by f − g q , and provide lower bounds for the cases where p = 1, 2. From a numerical analysis standpoint, since the Wasserstein distance is related to the cumulative distribution functions (CDF), we show that the latter is well approximated by methods such as spline interpolation and generalized polynomial chaos (gPC).},

These distances, based on optimal transportation between probability measures, include Wasserstein’s distances as particular cases.

Any loss that is not proper, or can not be transformed to be proper via a link function is inadmissible. All admissible losses for n-class problems can be obtained in terms of a convex body in {\textbackslash}mathbbR{\textasciicircum}n.  We show this explicitly and show how some existing results simplify when viewed from this perspective.  This  allows the development of a rich algebra of losses induced by binary operations on convex bodies (that return a convex body).  Furthermore it allows us to define an “inverse loss” which provides a universal “substitution function” for the Aggregating Algorithm.  In doing so we show a formal connection between proper losses and norms.},

Of course, all continuous maps are both compactness- and connectedness-preserving and the natural question about when the converse of this holds, i.e. under what conditions is such a map continuous, has a long history. Our main result is that any non-trivial product function, i.e. one having at least two non-constant factors, that has connected domain, \$T\_1\$ range, and is connectedness-preserving must actually be continuous. The analogous statement badly fails if we replace in it the occurrences of "connected" by "compact". We also present, however, several interesting results and examples concerning maps that are compactness-preserving and/or continuum-preserving.},

Moreover, a metric space is compact if and only if every sequence has a converging subsequence. However, in a general topological space these equivalences may fail. Unfortunately this fact is sometimes overlooked in introductory courses on general topology, leaving many students with misconceptions, e.g. that compactness would always be equal to sequence compactness. The aim of this article is to show how sequences might fail to characterize topological properties such as openness, continuity and compactness correctly. Moreover, I will define nets and show how they succeed where sequences fail.},

We provide a novel, explicit and complete characterisation of the convexity of any proper composite loss in terms of its link and its “weight function” associated with its proper CPE loss.},

	abstract = {Set-valued analysis is an essential tool for the mathematical formulation of many real-life situations, e.g., equilibrium theory in mathematical economics. This work offers the first comprehensive treatment in book form of the fairly new subdiscipline of enlargements of maximal monotone operators, including several important new results in the field. In the last decades, with the development of nonsmooth optimization, effective algorithms have been developed to solve these kinds of problems, such as nonsmooth variational inequalities. Several of these methods, such as bundle methods for variational problems, are fully developed and analyzed in this book. The first chapters provide a self-contained review of the basic notions and fundamental results in set-valued analysis, including set convergence and continuity of set-valued mappings together with many important results in infinite-dimensional convex analysis, leading to the classical fixed point results due to Ekeland, Caristi and Kakutani. Next, an in-depth introduction to monotone operators is developed, emphasizing results related to maximality of subdifferentials and of sums of monotone operators. Building on this foundational material, the second part of the monograph contains new results (all of them established during the last decade) on the concept of enlargements of monotone operators, with applications to variational inequalities, bundle-type methods, augmented Lagrangian methods, and proximal point algorithms},

This problem has been widely studied and O({\textbackslash}sqrtT) and O({\textbackslash}logT) regret bounds can be achieved for convex losses and strictly convex losses with bounded first and second derivatives respectively. In special cases like the Aggregating Algorithm with mixable losses and the Weighted Average Algorithm with exp-concave losses, it is possible to achieve O(1) regret bounds. But mixability and exp-concavity are roughly equivalent under certain conditions. Thus by understanding the underlying relationship between these two notions we can gain the best of both algorithms (strong theoretical performance guarantees of the Aggregating Algorithm and the computational efficiency of the Weighted Average Algorithm). In this paper we provide a complete characterization of the exp-concavity of any proper composite loss. Using this characterization and the mixability condition of proper losses, we show that it is possible to transform (re-parameterize) any β-mixable binary proper loss into a β-exp-concave composite loss with the same β. In the multi-class case, we propose an approximation approach for this transformation.},

	abstract = {We describe and develop a close relationship between two problems that have customarily been regarded as distinct: that of maximizing entropy, and that of minimizing worst-case expected loss. Using a formulation grounded in the equilibrium theory of zero-sum games between Decision Maker and Nature, these two problems are shown to be dual to each other, the solution to each providing that to the other. Although Topsoe described this connection for the Shannon entropy over 20 years ago, it does not appear to be widely known even in that important special case. We here generalize this theory to apply to arbitrary decision problems and loss functions. We indicate how an appropriate generalized definition of entropy can be associated with such a problem, and we show that, subject to certain regularity conditions, the above-mentioned duality continues to apply in this extended context. This simultaneously provides a possible rationale for maximizing entropy and a tool for finding robust Bayes acts. We also describe the essential identity between the problem of maximizing entropy and that of minimizing a related discrepancy or divergence between distributions. This leads to an extension, to arbitrary discrepancies, of a well-known minimax theorem for the case of Kullback-Leibler divergence (the "redundancy-capacity theorem" of information theory). For the important case of families of distributions having certain mean values specified, we develop simple sufficient conditions and methods for identifying the desired solutions. We use this theory to introduce a new concept of "generalized exponential family" linked to the specific decision problem under consideration, and we demonstrate that this shares many of the properties of standard exponential families. Finally, we show that the existence of an equilibrium in our game can be rephrased in terms of a "Pythagorean property" of the related divergence, thus generalizing previously announced results for Kullback-Leibler and Bregman divergences.},

It is proved that if \$n{\textbackslash}ge 2\$, with three trivial exceptions, an operation between origin-symmetric compact convex sets is continuous in the Hausdorff metric, \$GL(n)\$ covariant, and associative if and only if it is \$L\_p\$ addition for some \$1{\textbackslash}le p{\textbackslash}le {\textbackslash}infty \$. It is also demonstrated that if \$n{\textbackslash}ge 2\$, an operation \$*\$ between compact convex sets is continuous in the Hausdorff metric, \$GL(n)\$ covariant, and has the identity property (i.e., \$K*{\textbackslash}lbrace o{\textbackslash}rbrace =K={\textbackslash}lbrace o{\textbackslash}rbrace *K\$ for all compact convex sets \$K\$, where \$o\$ denotes the origin) if and only if it is Minkowski addition. Some analogous results for operations between star sets are obtained. Various characterizations are given of operations that are projection covariant, meaning that the operation can take place before or after projection onto subspaces, with the same effect. Several other new lines of investigation are followed. A relatively little-known but seminal operation called \$M\$-addition is generalized and systematically studied for the first time. Geometric-analytic formulas that characterize continuous and \$GL(n)\$-covariant operations between compact convex sets in terms of \$M\$-addition are established. It is shown that if \$n{\textbackslash}ge 2\$, an \$o\$-symmetrization of compact convex sets (i.e., a map from the compact convex sets to the origin-symmetric compact convex sets) is continuous in the Hausdorff metric, \$GL(n)\$ covariant, and translation invariant if and only if it is of the form \${\textbackslash}lambda DK\$ for some \${\textbackslash}lambda {\textbackslash}ge 0\$, where \$DK=K+(−K)\$ is the difference body of \$K\$. The term “polynomial volume” is introduced for the property of operations \$∗\$ between compact convex or star sets that the volume of \$rK*sL, r,s{\textbackslash}ge 0\$, is a polynomial in the variables \$r\$ and \$s\$. It is proved that if \$n{\textbackslash}ge 2\$, with three trivial exceptions, an operation between origin-symmetric compact convex sets is continuous in the Hausdorff metric, \$GL(n)\$ covariant, associative, and has polynomial volume if and only if it is Minkowski addition.},

	abstract = {A decision problem is defined in terms of an outcome space, an action space and a loss function. Starting from these simple ingredients, we can construct: Proper Scoring Rule; Entropy Function; Divergence Function; Riemannian Metric; and Unbiased Estimating Equation. From an abstract viewpoint, the loss function defines a duality between the outcome and action spaces, while the correspondence between a distribution and its Bayes act induces a self-duality. Together these determine a “decision geometry” for the family of distributions on outcome space. This allows generalisation of many standard statistical concepts and properties. In particular we define and study generalised exponential families. Several examples are analysed, including a general Bregman geometry.},

	abstract = {The last few years have seen a staggering number of empirical studies of the robustness of neural networks in a model of adversarial perturbations of their inputs. Most rely on an adversary which carries out local modifications within prescribed balls. None however has so far questioned the broader picture: how to frame a \textit{resource-bounded} adversary so that it can be \textit{severely detrimental} to learning, a non-trivial problem which entails at a minimum the choice of loss and classifiers. We suggest a formal answer for losses that satisfy the minimal statistical requirement of being \textit{proper}. We pin down a simple sufficient property for any given class of adversaries to be detrimental to learning, involving a central measure of “harmfulness” which generalizes the well-known class of integral probability metrics. A key feature of our result is that it holds for \textit{all} proper losses, and for a popular subset of these, the optimisation of this central measure appears to be \textit{independent of the loss}. When classifiers are Lipschitz – a now popular approach in adversarial training –, this optimisation resorts to \textit{optimal transport} to make a low-budget compression of class marginals. Toy experiments reveal a finding recently separately observed: training against a sufficiently budgeted adversary of this kind \textit{improves} generalization.},

	title = {Distributionally robust stochastic optimization with wasserstein distance},
	abstract = {Distributionally robust stochastic optimization (DRSO) is an approach to optimization under uncertainty in which, instead of assuming that there is an underlying probability distribution that is known exactly, one hedges against a chosen set of distributions. In this paper, we consider sets of distributions that are within a chosen Wasserstein distance from a nominal distribution. We argue that such a choice of sets has two advantages: (1) The resulting distributions hedged against are more reasonable than those resulting from other popular choices of sets, such as \{{\textbackslash}Phi\}-divergence ambiguity set. (2) The problem of determining the worst-case expectation has desirable tractability properties. We derive a dual reformulation of the corresponding DRSO problem and construct approximate worst-case distributions (or an exact worst-case distribution if it exists) explicitly via the first-order optimality conditions of the dual problem. Our contributions are five-fold. (i) We identify necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a worst-case distribution, which is naturally related to the growth rate of the objective function. (ii) We show that the worst-case distributions resulting from an appropriate Wasserstein distance have a concise structure and a clear interpretation. (iii) Using this structure, we show that data-driven DRSO problems can be approximated to any accuracy by robust optimization problems, and thereby many DRSO problems become tractable by using tools from robust optimization. (iv) To the best of our knowledge, our proof of strong duality is the first constructive proof for DRSO problems, and we show that the constructive proof technique is also useful in other contexts. (v) Our strong duality result holds in a very general setting, and we show that it can be applied to infinite dimensional process control problems and worst-case value-at-risk analysis.},

Hence, our representations allow us to view regularization as a result of introducing an artificial adversary that perturbs the empirical distribution to account for out-of-sample effects in loss estimation. In addition, we introduce RWPI (robust Wasserstein profile inference), a novel inference methodology which extends the use of methods inspired by empirical likelihood to the setting of optimal transport costs (of which Wasserstein distances are a particular case). We use RWPI to show how to optimally select the size of uncertainty regions, and as a consequence we are able to choose regularization parameters for these machine learning estimators without the use of cross validation. Numerical experiments are also given to validate our theoretical findings.},

This bound is highly conservative and depends on unstable quantities, and we relax it in several directions to show that non convexity can have a much milder impact on finite sum minimization problems such as empirical risk minimization and multi-task classification. As a byproduct, we show a new version of Maurey's classical approximate Carath{\textbackslash}'eodory lemma where we sample a significant fraction of the coefficients, without replacement, as well as a result on sampling constraints using an approximate Helly theorem, both of independent interest.},

By the composition property of Lipschitz functions, it suffices to ensure that each individual affine transformation or nonlinear activation is 1-Lipschitz. The challenge is to do this while maintaining the expressive power. We identify a necessary property for such an architecture: each of the layers must preserve the gradient norm during backpropagation. Based on this, we propose to combine a gradient norm preserving activation function, GroupSort, with norm-constrained weight matrices. We show that norm-constrained GroupSort architectures are universal Lipschitz function approximators. Empirically, we show that norm-constrained GroupSort networks achieve tighter estimates of Wasserstein distance than their ReLU counterparts and can achieve provable adversarial robustness guarantees with little cost to accuracy.},

Our evaluation study shows that, in isolation, our method performs comparatively to state-of-the-art regularisation techniques.

However, an accompanying burst of formal convergence guarantees has not followed; all results pay the price of heavy assumptions which are often unrealistic or hard to check. The \textit{Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)} literature — seemingly orthogonal to the aforementioned pursuit — has had the side effect of a renewed interest in variational divergence minimisation (notably f-GAN). We show how to combine this latter approach and the classical boosting theory in supervised learning to get the first density estimation algorithm that provably achieves geometric convergence under very weak assumptions. We do so by a trick allowing to combine \textit{classifiers} as the sufficient statistics of an exponential family. Our analysis includes an improved variational characterisation of f-GAN.},

	abstract = {Variational inference is a popular technique to approximate a possibly intractable Bayesian posterior with a more tractable one. Recently, boosting variational inference has been proposed as a new paradigm to approximate the posterior by a mixture of densities by greedily adding components to the mixture. However, as is the case with many other variational inference algorithms, its theoretical properties have not been studied. In the present work, we study the convergence properties of this approach from a modern optimization viewpoint by establishing connections to the classic Frank-Wolfe algorithm. Our analyses yields novel theoretical insights regarding the sufficient conditions for convergence, explicit rates, and algorithmic simplifications. Since a lot of focus in previous works for variational inference has been on tractability, our work is especially important as a much needed attempt to bridge the gap between probabilistic models and their corresponding theoretical properties.},

However, when Bayes’ rule does not result in tractable closed-form, most approximate inference algorithms lack either scalability or rigorous guarantees. To tackle this challenge, we propose a simple yet provable algorithm, Particle Mirror Descent (PMD), to iteratively approximate the posterior density. PMD is inspired by stochastic functional mirror descent where one descends in the density space using a small batch of data points at each iteration, and by particle filtering where one uses samples to approximate a function. We prove result of the first kind that, with m particles, PMD provides a posterior density estimator that converges in terms of KL-divergence to the true posterior in rate O(1/). We demonstrate competitive empirical performances of PMD compared to several approximate inference algorithms in mixture models, logistic regression, sparse Gaussian processes and latent Dirichlet allocation on large scale datasets.},

	abstract = {We propose a black-box variational inference method to approximate intractable distributions with an increasingly rich approximating class. Our method, variational boosting, iteratively refines an existing variational approximation by solving a sequence of optimization problems, allowing a trade-off between computation time and accuracy. We expand the variational approximating class by incorporating additional covariance structure and by introducing new components to form a mixture. We apply variational boosting to synthetic and real statistical models, and show that the resulting posterior inferences compare favorably to existing variational algorithms.},

@article{Guo_BoostingVariational_2017,
	title = {Boosting variational inference},
	abstract = {Variational inference (VI) provides fast approximations of a Bayesian posterior in part because it formulates posterior approximation as an optimization problem: to find the closest distribution to the exact posterior over some family of distributions. For practical reasons, the family of distributions in VI is usually constrained so that it does not include the exact posterior, even as a limit point. Thus, no matter how long VI is run, the resulting approximation will not approach the exact posterior. We propose to instead consider a more flexible approximating family consisting of all possible finite mixtures of a parametric base distribution (e.g., Gaussian). For efficient inference, we borrow ideas from gradient boosting to develop an algorithm we call boosting variational inference (BVI). BVI iteratively improves the current approximation by mixing it with a new component from the base distribution family and thereby yields progressively more accurate posterior approximations as more computing time is spent. Unlike a number of common VI variants including mean-field VI, BVI is able to capture multimodality, general posterior covariance, and nonstandard posterior shapes.},

	abstract = {Effective regularisation of neural networks is essential to combat overfitting due to the large number of parameters involved. We present an empirical analogue to the Lipschitz constant of a feed-forward neural network, which we refer to as the maximum gain. We hypothesise that constraining the gain of a network will have a regularising effect, similar to how constraining the Lipschitz constant of a network has been shown to improve generalisation. A simple algorithm is provided that involves rescaling the weight matrix of each layer after each parameter update. We conduct a series of studies on common benchmark datasets, and also a novel dataset that we introduce to enable easier significance testing for experiments using convolutional networks. Performance on these datasets compares favourably with other common regularisation techniques. Data related to this paper is available at: https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/{\textasciitilde}ml/sins10/.},

Parseval networks are empirically and theoretically motivated by an analysis of the robustness of the predictions made by deep neural networks when their input is subject to an adversarial perturbation. The most important feature of Parseval networks is to maintain weight matrices of linear and convolutional layers to be (approximately) Parseval tight frames, which are extensions of orthogonal matrices to non-square matrices. We describe how these constraints can be maintained efficiently during SGD. We show that Parseval networks match the state-of-the-art regarding accuracy on CIFAR-10/100 and Street View House Numbers (SVHN), while being more robust than their vanilla counterpart against adversarial examples. Incidentally, Parseval networks also tend to train faster and make a better usage of the full capacity of the networks.},

We propose a systematic algorithm for computing universal perturbations, and show that state-of-the-art deep neural networks are highly vulnerable to such perturbations, albeit being quasi-imperceptible to the human eye. We further empirically analyze these universal perturbations and show, in particular, that they generalize very well across neural networks. The surprising existence of universal perturbations reveals important geometric correlations among the high-dimensional decision boundary of classifiers. It further outlines potential security breaches with the existence of single directions in the input space that adversaries can possibly exploit to break a classifier on most natural images.},
