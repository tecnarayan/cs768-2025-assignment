abstract="We shall now consider the local behavior of curvature on an n-surface. The way in which an n-surface curves around in ℝn+1 is measured by the way the normal direction changes as we move from point to point on the surfacc. In order to measure the rate of changc of the normal direction, we need to be able to differentiate vector fields on n-surfaces.",
