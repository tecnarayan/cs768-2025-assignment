We present a new algorithm to generate minimal, stable, and symbolic
corrections to an input that will cause a neural network with ReLU activations
to change its output. We argue that such a correction is a useful way to
provide feedback to a user when the network's output is different from a
desired output. Our algorithm generates such a correction by solving a series
of linear constraint satisfaction problems. The technique is evaluated on three
neural network models: one predicting whether an applicant will pay a mortgage,
one predicting whether a first-order theorem can be proved efficiently by a
solver using certain heuristics, and the final one judging whether a drawing is
an accurate rendition of a canonical drawing of a cat.
