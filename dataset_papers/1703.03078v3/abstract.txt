Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for real-world robotic applications
need a data-efficient learning process and the ability to handle complex,
unknown dynamical systems. These requirements are handled well by model-based
and model-free RL approaches, respectively. In this work, we aim to combine the
advantages of these two types of methods in a principled manner. By focusing on
time-varying linear-Gaussian policies, we enable a model-based algorithm based
on the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) that can be integrated into the
model-free framework of path integral policy improvement (PI2). We can further
combine our method with guided policy search (GPS) to train arbitrary
parameterized policies such as deep neural networks. Our simulation and
real-world experiments demonstrate that this method can solve challenging
manipulation tasks with comparable or better performance than model-free
methods while maintaining the sample efficiency of model-based methods. A video
