abstract = {In this paper, we present an efficient method for dynamic calibration and 3D reconstruction using homographic transformation for a structured light system. We assume that the parameters of the projector are pre-calibrated and kept constant while the camera is allowed to be automatically adjusted or its parameters can be totally unknown. We firstly investigate into the image-to-world transformation in our system. Then we propose a solution for the dynamic image-to-world transformation. One advantage of our method is that the procedure for initial calibration and recalibration of the system is simple and accurate. Another is that, in the 3D measurement and reconstruction, only one image is needed and the computational cost is low compared with traditional methods. Our method can be used in a dynamic as well as static environment. Simulation and real experiments have been conducted using our system and the reconstructed results turn out to be satisfactory.}
