In overparametrized models, the noise in stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
implicitly regularizes the optimization trajectory and determines which local
minimum SGD converges to. Motivated by empirical studies that demonstrate that
training with noisy labels improves generalization, we study the implicit
regularization effect of SGD with label noise. We show that SGD with label
noise converges to a stationary point of a regularized loss $L(\theta) +\lambda
R(\theta)$, where $L(\theta)$ is the training loss, $\lambda$ is an effective
regularization parameter depending on the step size, strength of the label
noise, and the batch size, and $R(\theta)$ is an explicit regularizer that
penalizes sharp minimizers. Our analysis uncovers an additional regularization
effect of large learning rates beyond the linear scaling rule that penalizes
large eigenvalues of the Hessian more than small ones. We also prove extensions
to classification with general loss functions, SGD with momentum, and SGD with
general noise covariance, significantly strengthening the prior work of Blanc
et al. to global convergence and large learning rates and of HaoChen et al. to
general models.
