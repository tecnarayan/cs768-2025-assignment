Given a matrix M of low-rank, we consider the problem of reconstructing it
from noisy observations of a small, random subset of its entries. The problem
arises in a variety of applications, from collaborative filtering (the `Netflix
problem') to structure-from-motion and positioning. We study a low complexity
algorithm introduced by Keshavan et al.(2009), based on a combination of
spectral techniques and manifold optimization, that we call here OptSpace. We
prove performance guarantees that are order-optimal in a number of
circumstances.
