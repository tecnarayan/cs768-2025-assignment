  abstract = 	 {Being able to efficiently and accurately select the top-$k$ elements with differential privacy is an integral component of various private data analysis tasks. In this paper, we present the oneshot Laplace mechanism, which generalizes the well-known Report Noisy Max&nbsp;\cite{dwork2014algorithmic} mechanism to reporting noisy top-$k$ elements. We show that the oneshot Laplace mechanism with a noise level of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{k}/\eps)$ is approximately differentially private. Compared to the previous peeling approach of running Report Noisy Max $k$ times, the oneshot Laplace mechanism only adds noises and computes the top $k$ elements once, hence much more efficient for large $k$. In addition, our proof of privacy relies on a novel coupling technique that bypasses the composition theorems so without the linear dependence on $k$ which is inherent to various composition theorems. Finally, we present a novel application of efficient top-$k$ selection in the classical problem of ranking from pairwise comparisons.}

Differential privacy requires that our choice of these $k$ columns does not depend too much on any on individualâ€™s dataset. This problem can be solved using the well known exponential mechanism and composition properties of differential privacy. In the high-accuracy regime, where we require the error of the selection procedure to be to be smaller than the so-called sampling error $Î±â‰ˆ\sqrt\ln(d)/n$, this procedure succeeds given a dataset of size $n â‰³k \ln(d)$. We prove a matching lower bound, showing that a dataset of size $n â‰³k \ln(d)$ is necessary for private top-$k$ selection in this high-accuracy regime. Our lower bound shows that selecting the $k$ largest columns requires more data than simply estimating the value of those $k$ columns, which can be done using a dataset of size just $n â‰³k$. } }
