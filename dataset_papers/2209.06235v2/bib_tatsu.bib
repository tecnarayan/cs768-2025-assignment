  abstract	= {Word embedding models have been shown to be effective in
		  performing a wide variety of Natural Language Processing
		  (NLP) tasks such as identifying audiences for web
		  advertisements, parsing resum\'{e}s to select promising job
		  candidates, and translating documents from one language to
		  another. However, it has been demonstrated that NLP systems
		  learn gender bias from the corpora of documents on which
		  they are trained. It is increasingly common for pre-trained
		  models to be used as a starting point for building
		  applications in a wide range of areas including critical
		  decision making applications. It is also very easy to use a
		  pre-trained model as the basis for a new application
		  without careful consideration of the original nature of the
		  training set. In this paper, we quantify the degree to
		  which gender bias differs with the corpora used for
		  training. We look especially at the impact of starting with
		  a pre-trained model and fine-tuning with additional data.
		  Specifically, we calculate a measure of direct gender bias
		  on several pre-trained models including BERT’s Wikipedia
		  and Book corpus models as well as on several fine-tuned
		  General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE)
		  benchmarks. In addition, we evaluate the bias from several
		  more extreme corpora including the Jigsaw identity toxic
		  dataset that includes toxic speech biased against race,
		  gender, religion, and disability and the RtGender dataset
		  that includes speech specifically labelled by gender. Our
		  results reveal that the direct gender bias of the Jigsaw
		  toxic identity dataset is surprisingly close to that of the
		  base pre-trained Google model, but the RtGender dataset has
		  significantly higher direct gender bias than the base
		  model. When the bias learned by an NLP system can vary
		  significantly with the corpora used for training, it
		  becomes important to consider and report these details,
		  especially for use in critical decision-making
		  applications.},

  abstract	= {This paper describes a testing methodology for
		  quantitatively assessing the risk that rare or unique
		  training-data sequences are unintentionally memorized by
		  generative sequence models--a common type of
		  machine-learning model. Because such models are sometimes
		  trained on sensitive data (e.g., the text of users' private
		  messages), this methodology can benefit privacy by allowing
		  deep-learning practitioners to select means of training
		  that minimize such memorization.In experiments, we show
		  that unintended memorization is a persistent, hard-to-avoid
		  issue that can have serious consequences. Specifically, for
		  models trained without consideration of memorization, we
		  describe new, efficient procedures that can extract unique,
		  secret sequences, such as credit card numbers. We show that
		  our testing strategy is a practical and easy-to-use first
		  line of defense, e.g., by describing its application to
		  quantitatively limit data exposure in Google's Smart
		  Compose, a commercial text-completion neural network
		  trained on millions of users' email messages.},

  abstract	= {Large pre-trained neural networks such as BERT have had
		  great recent success in NLP, motivating a growing body of
		  research investigating what aspects of language they are
		  able to learn from unlabeled data. Most recent analysis has
		  focused on model outputs (e.g., language model surprisal)
		  or internal vector representations (e.g., probing
		  classifiers). Complementary to these works, we propose
		  methods for analyzing the attention mechanisms of
		  pre-trained models and apply them to BERT. BERT{'}s
		  attention heads exhibit patterns such as attending to
		  delimiter tokens, specific positional offsets, or broadly
		  attending over the whole sentence, with heads in the same
		  layer often exhibiting similar behaviors. We further show
		  that certain attention heads correspond well to linguistic
		  notions of syntax and coreference. For example, we find
		  heads that attend to the direct objects of verbs,
		  determiners of nouns, objects of prepositions, and
		  coreferent mentions with remarkably high accuracy. Lastly,
		  we propose an attention-based probing classifier and use it
		  to further demonstrate that substantial syntactic
		  information is captured in BERT{'}s attention.}

		  neurons. Specifically, we examine the fill-in-the-blank
		  cloze task for BERT. Given a relational fact, we propose a
		  knowledge attribution method to identify the neurons that
		  express the fact. We find that the activation of such
		  knowledge neurons is positively correlated to the
		  expression of their corresponding facts. In our case
		  studies, we attempt to leverage knowledge neurons to edit
		  (such as update, and erase) specific factual knowledge
		  without fine-tuning. Our results shed light on
		  understanding the storage of knowledge within pretrained
		  Transformers.}

		  BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder
		  Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language
		  representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et
		  al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-train deep
		  bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by
		  jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all
		  layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be
		  fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create
		  state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as
		  question answering and language inference, without
		  substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT
		  is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains
		  new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language
		  processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5
		  (7.7 point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to
		  86.7{\%} (4.6{\%} absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1
		  question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute
		  improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point

		  generation, we introduce the Bias in Open-Ended Language
		  Generation Dataset (BOLD), a large-scale dataset that
		  consists of 23,679 English text generation prompts for bias

		  automated metrics for toxicity, psycholinguistic norms, and
		  text gender polarity to measure social biases in open-ended
		  text generation from multiple angles. An examination of
		  text generated from three popular language models reveals
		  that the majority of these models exhibit a larger social
		  bias than human-written Wikipedia text across all domains.
		  With these results we highlight the need to benchmark

		  generate content inconsistent with the source document,
		  i.e. unfaithful. Existing automatic metrics do not capture
		  such mistakes effectively. We tackle the problem of
		  evaluating faithfulness of a generated summary given its
		  source document. We first collected human annotations of
		  faithfulness for outputs from numerous models on two
		  datasets. We find that current models exhibit a trade-off
		  between abstractiveness and faithfulness: outputs with less
		  word overlap with the source document are more likely to be
		  unfaithful. Next, we propose an automatic question
		  answering (QA) based metric for faithfulness, FEQA, which
		  leverages recent advances in reading comprehension. Given
		  question-answer pairs generated from the summary, a QA
		  model extracts answers from the document; non-matched
		  answers indicate unfaithful information in the summary.
		  Among metrics based on word overlap, embedding similarity,
		  and learned language understanding models, our QA-based
		  metric has significantly higher correlation with human
		  faithfulness scores, especially on highly abstractive
		  summaries.}

		  summarization evaluation methods along five dimensions: 1)
		  we re-evaluate 12 automatic evaluation metrics in a
		  comprehensive and consistent fashion using neural
		  summarization model outputs along with expert and
		  crowd-sourced human annotations, 2) we consistently
		  benchmark 23 recent summarization models using the
		  aforementioned automatic evaluation metrics, 3) we assemble
		  the largest collection of summaries generated by models
		  trained on the CNN/DailyMail news dataset and share it in a
		  unified format, 4) we implement and share a toolkit that
		  provides an extensible and unified API for evaluating
		  summarization models across a broad range of automatic
		  metrics, 5) we assemble and share the largest and most
		  diverse, in terms of model types, collection of human
		  judgments of model-generated summaries on the CNN/Daily
		  Mail dataset annotated by both expert judges and crowd
		  source workers. We hope that this work will help promote a

		  to remarkably fluent summaries, factual errors in generated
		  summaries still severely limit their use in practice. In
		  this paper, we evaluate summaries produced by
		  state-of-the-art models via crowdsourcing and show that
		  such errors occur frequently, in particular with more
		  abstractive models. We study whether textual entailment
		  predictions can be used to detect such errors and if they
		  can be reduced by reranking alternative predicted
		  summaries. That leads to an interesting downstream
		  application for entailment models. In our experiments, we
		  find that out-of-the-box entailment models trained on NLI
		  datasets do not yet offer the desired performance for the
		  downstream task and we therefore release our annotations as
		  additional test data for future extrinsic evaluations of
		  NLI.}

  abstract	= {Existing open-domain dialog models are generally trained
		  to minimize the perplexity of target human responses.
		  However, some human replies are more engaging than others,
		  spawning more followup interactions. Current conversational
		  models are increasingly capable of producing turns that are
		  context-relevant, but in order to produce compelling
		  agents, these models need to be able to predict and
		  optimize for turns that are genuinely engaging. We leverage
		  social media feedback data (number of replies and upvotes)
		  to build a large-scale training dataset for feedback
		  prediction. To alleviate possible distortion between the
		  feedback and engagingness, we convert the ranking problem
		  to a comparison of response pairs which involve few
		  confounding factors. We trained DialogRPT, a set of GPT-2
		  based models on 133M pairs of human feedback data and the
		  resulting ranker outperformed several baselines.
		  Particularly, our ranker outperforms the conventional
		  dialog perplexity baseline with a large margin on
		  predicting Reddit feedback. We finally combine the feedback
		  prediction models and a human-like scoring model to rank
		  the machine-generated dialog responses. Crowd-sourced human
		  evaluation shows that our ranking method correlates better
		  with real human preferences than baseline models.}

  abstract	= {Modern deep learning models for NLP are notoriously
		  opaque. This has motivated the development of methods for
		  interpreting such models, e.g., via gradient-based saliency
		  maps or the visualization of attention weights. Such
		  approaches aim to provide explanations for a particular
		  model prediction by highlighting important words in the
		  corresponding input text. While this might be useful for
		  tasks where decisions are explicitly influenced by
		  individual tokens in the input, we suspect that such
		  highlighting is not suitable for tasks where model
		  decisions should be driven by more complex reasoning. In
		  this work, we investigate the use of influence functions
		  for NLP, providing an alternative approach to interpreting
		  neural text classifiers. Influence functions explain the
		  decisions of a model by identifying influential training
		  examples. Despite the promise of this approach, influence
		  functions have not yet been extensively evaluated in the
		  context of NLP, a gap addressed by this work. We conduct a
		  comparison between influence functions and common
		  word-saliency methods on representative tasks. As
		  suspected, we find that influence functions are
		  particularly useful for natural language inference, a task
		  in which {`}saliency maps{'} may not have clear
		  interpretation. Furthermore, we develop a new quantitative
		  measure based on influence functions that can reveal
		  artifacts in training data.}

		  language models like BERT has become a dominating approach
		  for most NLP tasks. Simply fine-tuning those large language
		  models on downstream tasks or combining it with
		  task-specific pretraining is often not robust. In
		  particular, the performance considerably varies as the
		  random seed changes or the number of pretraining and/or
		  fine-tuning iterations varies, and the fine-tuned model is
		  vulnerable to adversarial attack. We propose a simple yet
		  effective adapter-based approach to mitigate these issues.
		  Specifically, we insert small bottleneck layers (i.e.,
		  adapter) within each layer of a pretrained model, then fix
		  the pretrained layers and train the adapter layers on the
		  downstream task data, with (1) task-specific unsupervised
		  pretraining and then (2) task-specific supervised training
		  (e.g., classification, sequence labeling). Our experiments
		  demonstrate that such a training scheme leads to improved
		  stability and adversarial robustness in transfer learning
		  to various downstream tasks.}

  abstract	= {Unsupervised learning of syntactic structure is typically
		  performed using generative models with discrete latent
		  variables and multinomial parameters. In most cases, these
		  models have not leveraged continuous word representations.
		  In this work, we propose a novel generative model that
		  jointly learns discrete syntactic structure and continuous
		  word representations in an unsupervised fashion by
		  cascading an invertible neural network with a structured
		  generative prior. We show that the invertibility condition
		  allows for efficient exact inference and marginal
		  likelihood computation in our model so long as the prior is
		  well-behaved. In experiments we instantiate our approach
		  with both Markov and tree-structured priors, evaluating on
		  two tasks: part-of-speech (POS) induction, and unsupervised
		  dependency parsing without gold POS annotation. On the Penn
		  Treebank, our Markov-structured model surpasses
		  state-of-the-art results on POS induction. Similarly, we
		  find that our tree-structured model achieves
		  state-of-the-art performance on unsupervised dependency
		  parsing for the difficult training condition where neither
		  gold POS annotation nor punctuation-based constraints are
		  available.}

		  knowledge in word representations. However, current methods
		  for detecting syntactic knowledge do not test whether
		  syntax trees are represented in their entirety. In this
		  work, we propose a structural probe, which evaluates
		  whether syntax trees are embedded in a linear
		  transformation of a neural network{'}s word representation
		  space. The probe identifies a linear transformation under
		  which squared L2 distance encodes the distance between
		  words in the parse tree, and one in which squared L2 norm
		  encodes depth in the parse tree. Using our probe, we show
		  that such transformations exist for both ELMo and BERT but
		  not in baselines, providing evidence that entire syntax
		  trees are embedded implicitly in deep models{'} vector
		  geometry.}

  abstract	= {Merchants selling products on the Web often ask their
		  customers to review the products that they have purchased
		  and the associated services. As e-commerce is becoming more
		  and more popular, the number of customer reviews that a
		  product receives grows rapidly. For a popular product, the
		  number of reviews can be in hundreds or even thousands.
		  This makes it difficult for a potential customer to read
		  them to make an informed decision on whether to purchase
		  the product. It also makes it difficult for the
		  manufacturer of the product to keep track and to manage
		  customer opinions. For the manufacturer, there are
		  additional difficulties because many merchant sites may
		  sell the same product and the manufacturer normally
		  produces many kinds of products. In this research, we aim
		  to mine and to summarize all the customer reviews of a
		  product. This summarization task is different from
		  traditional text summarization because we only mine the
		  features of the product on which the customers have
		  expressed their opinions and whether the opinions are
		  positive or negative. We do not summarize the reviews by
		  selecting a subset or rewrite some of the original
		  sentences from the reviews to capture the main points as in
		  the classic text summarization. Our task is performed in
		  three steps: (1) mining product features that have been
		  commented on by customers; (2) identifying opinion
		  sentences in each review and deciding whether each opinion
		  sentence is positive or negative; (3) summarizing the
		  results. This paper proposes several novel techniques to
		  perform these tasks. Our experimental results using reviews
		  of a number of products sold online demonstrate the
		  effectiveness of the techniques.},

  abstract	= {Recent work has presented intriguing results examining the
		  knowledge contained in language models (LMs) by having the
		  LM fill in the blanks of prompts such as {``}Obama is a
		  {\_}{\_} by profession{''}. These prompts are usually
		  manually created, and quite possibly sub-optimal; another
		  prompt such as {``}Obama worked as a {\_}{\_} {''} may
		  result in more accurately predicting the correct
		  profession. Because of this, given an inappropriate prompt,
		  we might fail to retrieve facts that the LM does know, and
		  thus any given prompt only provides a lower bound estimate
		  of the knowledge contained in an LM. In this paper, we
		  attempt to more accurately estimate the knowledge contained
		  in LMs by automatically discovering better prompts to use
		  in this querying process. Specifically, we propose
		  mining-based and paraphrasing-based methods to
		  automatically generate high-quality and diverse prompts, as
		  well as ensemble methods to combine answers from different
		  prompts. Extensive experiments on the LAMA benchmark for
		  extracting relational knowledge from LMs demonstrate that
		  our methods can improve accuracy from 31.1{\%} to 39.6{\%},
		  providing a tighter lower bound on what LMs know. We have
		  released the code and the resulting LM Prompt And Query
		  Archive (LPAQA) at https://github.com/jzbjyb/LPAQA.}

		  These codes also allow CTRL to predict which parts of the

  abstract	= {How can we explain the predictions of a black-box model?
		  In this paper, we use influence functions — a classic
		  technique from robust statistics — to trace a model’s
		  prediction through the learning algorithm and back to its
		  training data, thereby identifying training points most
		  responsible for a given prediction. To scale up influence
		  functions to modern machine learning settings, we develop a
		  simple, efficient implementation that requires only oracle
		  access to gradients and Hessian-vector products. We show
		  that even on non-convex and non-differentiable models where
		  the theory breaks down, approximations to influence
		  functions can still provide valuable information. On linear
		  models and convolutional neural networks, we demonstrate
		  that influence functions are useful for multiple purposes:
		  understanding model behavior, debugging models, detecting
		  dataset errors, and even creating
		  visually-indistinguishable training-set attacks.}

  abstract	= {Class-conditional language models (CC-LMs) can be used to
		  generate natural language with specific attributes, such as
		  style or sentiment, by conditioning on an attribute label,
		  or control code. However, we find that these models
		  struggle to control generation when applied to
		  out-of-domain prompts or unseen control codes. To overcome
		  these limitations, we propose generative discriminator
		  (GeDi) guided contrastive generation, which uses CC-LMs as
		  generative discriminators (GeDis) to efficiently guide
		  generation from a (potentially much larger) LM towards a
		  desired attribute. In our human evaluation experiments, we
		  show that GeDis trained for sentiment control on movie
		  reviews are able to control the tone of book text. We also
		  demonstrate that GeDis are able to detoxify generation and
		  control topic while maintaining the same level of
		  linguistic acceptability as direct generation from GPT-2
		  (1.5B parameters). Lastly, we show that a GeDi trained on
		  only 4 topics can generalize to new control codes from word
		  embeddings, allowing it to guide generation towards wide
		  array of topics.},

		  systems still suffer from faithfulness errors. While prior
		  work has proposed models that improve faithfulness, it is
		  unclear whether the improvement comes from an increased
		  level of extractiveness of the model outputs as one naive
		  way to improve faithfulness is to make summarization models
		  more extractive. In this work, we present a framework for
		  evaluating the effective faithfulness of summarization
		  systems, by generating a faithfulness-abstractiveness
		  trade-off curve that serves as a control at different
		  operating points on the abstractiveness spectrum. We then
		  show that the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) baseline
		  as well as recently proposed methods for improving
		  faithfulness, fail to consistently improve over the control
		  at the same level of abstractiveness. Finally, we learn a
		  selector to identify the most faithful and abstractive
		  summary for a given document, and show that this system can
		  attain higher faithfulness scores in human evaluations
		  while being more abstractive than the baseline system on
		  two datasets. Moreover, we show that our system is able to
		  achieve a better faithfulness-abstractiveness trade-off
		  than the control at the same level of abstractiveness.}

  abstract	= {We present BART, a denoising autoencoder for pretraining
		  sequence-to-sequence models. BART is trained by (1)
		  corrupting text with an arbitrary noising function, and (2)
		  learning a model to reconstruct the original text. It uses
		  a standard Tranformer-based neural machine translation
		  architecture which, despite its simplicity, can be seen as
		  generalizing BERT (due to the bidirectional encoder), GPT
		  (with the left-to-right decoder), and other recent
		  pretraining schemes. We evaluate a number of noising
		  approaches, finding the best performance by both randomly
		  shuffling the order of sentences and using a novel
		  in-filling scheme, where spans of text are replaced with a
		  single mask token. BART is particularly effective when fine
		  tuned for text generation but also works well for
		  comprehension tasks. It matches the performance of RoBERTa
		  on GLUE and SQuAD, and achieves new state-of-the-art
		  results on a range of abstractive dialogue, question
		  answering, and summarization tasks, with gains of up to 3.5
		  ROUGE. BART also provides a 1.1 BLEU increase over a
		  back-translation system for machine translation, with only
		  target language pretraining. We also replicate other
		  pretraining schemes within the BART framework, to
		  understand their effect on end-task performance.}

  abstract	= {Contextual word representations derived from large-scale
		  neural language models are successful across a diverse set
		  of NLP tasks, suggesting that they encode useful and
		  transferable features of language. To shed light on the
		  linguistic knowledge they capture, we study the
		  representations produced by several recent pretrained
		  contextualizers (variants of ELMo, the OpenAI transformer
		  language model, and BERT) with a suite of sixteen diverse
		  probing tasks. We find that linear models trained on top of
		  frozen contextual representations are competitive with
		  state-of-the-art task-specific models in many cases, but
		  fail on tasks requiring fine-grained linguistic knowledge
		  (e.g., conjunct identification). To investigate the
		  transferability of contextual word representations, we
		  quantify differences in the transferability of individual
		  layers within contextualizers, especially between recurrent
		  neural networks (RNNs) and transformers. For instance,
		  higher layers of RNNs are more task-specific, while
		  transformer layers do not exhibit the same monotonic trend.
		  In addition, to better understand what makes contextual
		  word representations transferable, we compare language
		  model pretraining with eleven supervised pretraining tasks.
		  For any given task, pretraining on a closely related task
		  yields better performance than language model pretraining
		  (which is better on average) when the pretraining dataset
		  is fixed. However, language model pretraining on more data
		  gives the best results.}

  abstract	= {It is well known that the standard likelihood training and
		  approximate decoding objectives in neural text generation
		  models lead to less human-like responses for open-ended
		  tasks such as language modeling and story generation. In
		  this paper we have analyzed limitations of these models for
		  abstractive document summarization and found that these
		  models are highly prone to hallucinate content that is
		  unfaithful to the input document. We conducted a large
		  scale human evaluation of several neural abstractive
		  summarization systems to better understand the types of
		  hallucinations they produce. Our human annotators found
		  substantial amounts of hallucinated content in all model
		  generated summaries. However, our analysis does show that
		  pretrained models are better summarizers not only in terms
		  of raw metrics, i.e., ROUGE, but also in generating
		  faithful and factual summaries as evaluated by humans.
		  Furthermore, we show that textual entailment measures
		  better correlate with faithfulness than standard metrics,
		  potentially leading the way to automatic evaluation metrics
		  as well as training and decoding criteria.}

		  often factually unreliable outputs. This motivated a surge
		  of metrics attempting to measure the factuality of
		  automatically generated summaries. Due to the lack of
		  common benchmarks, these metrics cannot be compared.
		  Moreover, all these methods treat factuality as a binary
		  concept and fail to provide deeper insights on the kinds of
		  inconsistencies made by different systems. To address these
		  limitations, we devise a typology of factual errors and use
		  it to collect human annotations of generated summaries from
		  state-of-the-art summarization systems for the CNN/DM and
		  XSum datasets. Through these annotations we identify the
		  proportion of different categories of factual errors and
		  benchmark factuality metrics, showing their correlation
		  with human judgement as well as their specific strengths
		  and weaknesses.}

		  bidirectional language models (biLMs) have recently been
		  shown to provide significant improvements to the state of
		  the art for a wide range of NLP tasks. However, many
		  questions remain as to how and why these models are so
		  effective. In this paper, we present a detailed empirical
		  study of how the choice of neural architecture (e.g. LSTM,
		  CNN, or self attention) influences both end task accuracy
		  and qualitative properties of the representations that are
		  learned. We show there is a tradeoff between speed and
		  accuracy, but all architectures learn high quality
		  contextual representations that outperform word embeddings
		  for four challenging NLP tasks. Additionally, all
		  architectures learn representations that vary with network
		  depth, from exclusively morphological based at the word
		  embedding layer through local syntax based in the lower
		  contextual layers to longer range semantics such
		  coreference at the upper layers. Together, these results
		  suggest that unsupervised biLMs, independent of
		  architecture, are learning much more about the structure of
		  language than previously appreciated.}

		  textual corpora led to a surge of improvements for
		  downstream NLP tasks. Whilst learning linguistic knowledge,
		  these models may also be storing relational knowledge
		  present in the training data, and may be able to answer
		  queries structured as {``}fill-in-the-blank{''} cloze
		  statements. Language models have many advantages over
		  structured knowledge bases: they require no schema
		  engineering, allow practitioners to query about an open
		  class of relations, are easy to extend to more data, and
		  require no human supervision to train. We present an
		  in-depth analysis of the relational knowledge already
		  present (without fine-tuning) in a wide range of
		  state-of-the-art pretrained language models. We find that
		  (i) without fine-tuning, BERT contains relational knowledge
		  competitive with traditional NLP methods that have some
		  access to oracle knowledge, (ii) BERT also does remarkably
		  well on open-domain question answering against a supervised
		  baseline, and (iii) certain types of factual knowledge are
		  learned much more readily than others by standard language
		  model pretraining approaches. The surprisingly strong
		  ability of these models to recall factual knowledge without
		  any fine-tuning demonstrates their potential as
		  unsupervised open-domain QA systems. The code to reproduce
		  our analysis is available at

		  entity-relation triples, a format widely used for knowledge
		  representation and semantics description. DART consists of
		  82,191 examples across different domains with each input
		  being a semantic RDF triple set derived from data records
		  in tables and the tree ontology of the schema, annotated
		  with sentence descriptions that cover all facts in the
		  triple set. This hierarchical, structured format with its
		  open-domain nature differentiates DART from other existing
		  table-to-text corpora. We conduct an analysis of DART on
		  several state-of-the-art text generation models, showing
		  that it introduces new and interesting challenges compared
		  to existing datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
		  finetuning pretrained language models on DART facilitates
		  out-of-domain generalization on the WebNLG 2017 dataset.
		  DART is available at https://github.com/Yale-LILY/dart.},

  abstract	= {Neural sequence-to-sequence models have provided a viable
		  new approach for abstractive text summarization (meaning
		  they are not restricted to simply selecting and rearranging
		  passages from the original text). However, these models
		  have two shortcomings: they are liable to reproduce factual
		  details inaccurately, and they tend to repeat themselves.
		  In this work we propose a novel architecture that augments
		  the standard sequence-to-sequence attentional model in two
		  orthogonal ways. First, we use a hybrid pointer-generator
		  network that can copy words from the source text via
		  pointing, which aids accurate reproduction of information,
		  while retaining the ability to produce novel words through
		  the generator. Second, we use coverage to keep track of
		  what has been summarized, which discourages repetition. We
		  apply our model to the CNN / Daily Mail summarization task,
		  outperforming the current abstractive state-of-the-art by
		  at least 2 ROUGE points.}

		  two agents is a difficult task, especially in open-domain
		  chit-chat style dialogue. There have been recent efforts to
		  develop automatic dialogue evaluation metrics, but most of
		  them do not generalize to unseen datasets and/or need a
		  human-generated reference response during inference, making
		  it infeasible for online evaluation. Here, we propose an
		  unreferenced automated evaluation metric that uses large
		  pre-trained language models to extract latent
		  representations of utterances, and leverages the temporal
		  transitions that exist between them. We show that our model
		  achieves higher correlation with human annotations in an
		  online setting, while not requiring true responses for
		  comparison during inference.}

		  structural barriers nonwhite immigrants face. By comparing
		  nonwhite immigrants with native-born Americans, we can
		  better understand how racial logics affect the
		  identification of racial minorities in the United States.
		  Drawing on 153 interviews with Indian, Caribbean, Chinese,
		  Filipino, and Mexican immigrants, and comparing their
		  narratives to those of black native-born respondents, the
		  authors find similar understandings of American identity
		  across immigrant groups as well as barriers to recognition
		  as American shared by immigrants and native-born blacks.
		  Immigrant narratives continue to reify the United States as
		  a white nation, thus leading to their exclusion by default.

		  deep network to its input features, a problem previously
		  studied by several other works. We identify two fundamental
		  axioms— Sensitivity and Implementation Invariance that
		  attribution methods ought to satisfy. We show that they are
		  not satisfied by most known attribution methods, which we
		  consider to be a fundamental weakness of those methods. We
		  use the axioms to guide the design of a new attribution
		  method called Integrated Gradients. Our method requires no
		  modification to the original network and is extremely
		  simple to implement; it just needs a few calls to the
		  standard gradient operator. We apply this method to a
		  couple of image models, a couple of text models and a
		  chemistry model, demonstrating its ability to debug
		  networks, to extract rules from a network, and to enable
		  users to engage with models better.},

		  represents the steps of the traditional NLP pipeline in an

		  responsible for each step appear in the expected sequence:
		  POS tagging, parsing, NER, semantic roles, then
		  coreference. Qualitative analysis reveals that the model
		  can and often does adjust this pipeline dynamically,
		  revising lower-level decisions on the basis of
		  disambiguating information from higher-level

		  generated. We show that error exponents for particular
		  language models are bounded in terms of their perplexity, a
		  standard measure of language generation performance. Under
		  the assumption that human language is stationary and
		  ergodic, the formulation is extended from considering
		  specific language models to considering maximum likelihood
		  language models, among the class of k-order Markov
		  approximations; error probabilities are characterized. Some

  abstract	= {To measure how well pretrained representations encode some
		  linguistic property, it is common to use accuracy of a
		  probe, i.e. a classifier trained to predict the property
		  from the representations. Despite widespread adoption of
		  probes, differences in their accuracy fail to adequately
		  reflect differences in representations. For example, they
		  do not substantially favour pretrained representations over
		  randomly initialized ones. Analogously, their accuracy can
		  be similar when probing for genuine linguistic labels and
		  probing for random synthetic tasks. To see reasonable
		  differences in accuracy with respect to these random
		  baselines, previous work had to constrain either the amount
		  of probe training data or its model size. Instead, we
		  propose an alternative to the standard probes,
		  information-theoretic probing with minimum description
		  length (MDL). With MDL probing, training a probe to predict
		  labels is recast as teaching it to effectively transmit the
		  data. Therefore, the measure of interest changes from probe
		  accuracy to the description length of labels given
		  representations. In addition to probe quality, the
		  description length evaluates {``}the amount of effort{''}
		  needed to achieve the quality. This amount of effort
		  characterizes either (i) size of a probing model, or (ii)
		  the amount of data needed to achieve the high quality. We
		  consider two methods for estimating MDL which can be easily
		  implemented on top of the standard probing pipelines:
		  variational coding and online coding. We show that these
		  methods agree in results and are more informative and
		  stable than the standard probes.}

		  state-of-the-art results across all tasks, on four datasets

		  different techniques to construct span representations.
		  Contextualized embeddings like BERT perform well at
		  capturing relationships among entities in the same or
		  adjacent sentences, while dynamic span graph updates model
		  long-range cross-sentence relationships. For instance,
		  propagating span representations via predicted coreference
		  links can enable the model to disambiguate challenging

		  \textit{probe} learns to solve specific linguistic tasks
		  (e.g., dependency parsing) in a supervised manner using
		  feature representations (e.g., contextualized embeddings).
		  The effectiveness of such \textit{probing} tasks is taken
		  as evidence that the pre-trained model encodes linguistic
		  knowledge. However, this approach of evaluating a language
		  model is undermined by the uncertainty of the amount of
		  knowledge that is learned by the probe itself.
		  Complementary to those works, we propose a parameter-free
		  probing technique for analyzing pre-trained language models
		  (e.g., BERT). Our method does not require direct
		  supervision from the probing tasks, nor do we introduce
		  additional parameters to the probing process. Our
		  experiments on BERT show that syntactic trees recovered
		  from BERT using our method are significantly better than
		  linguistically-uninformed baselines. We further feed the
		  empirically induced dependency structures into a downstream
		  sentiment classification task and find its improvement
		  compatible with or even superior to a human-designed
		  dependency schema.}

		  To build connections between existing many-shot intents and
		  few-shot intents, we consider an intent as a combination of
		  a domain and an action, and propose a composed variational
		  natural language generator (CLANG), a transformer-based
		  conditional variational autoencoder. CLANG utilizes two
		  latent variables to represent the utterances corresponding
		  to two different independent parts (domain and action) in
		  the intent, and the latent variables are composed together
		  to generate natural examples. Additionally, to improve the
		  generator learning, we adopt the contrastive regularization
		  loss that contrasts the in-class with the out-of-class
		  utterance generation given the intent. To evaluate the
		  quality of the generated utterances, experiments are
		  conducted on the generalized few-shot intent detection
		  task. Empirical results show that our proposed model
		  achieves state-of-the-art performances on two real-world
		  intent detection datasets.},

  abstract	= {Automatic evaluation metrics are a crucial component of
		  dialog systems research. Standard language evaluation
		  metrics are known to be ineffective for evaluating dialog.
		  As such, recent research has proposed a number of novel,
		  dialog-specific metrics that correlate better with human
		  judgements. Due to the fast pace of research, many of these
		  metrics have been assessed on different datasets and there
		  has as yet been no time for a systematic comparison between
		  them. To this end, this paper provides a comprehensive
		  assessment of recently proposed dialog evaluation metrics
		  on a number of datasets. In this paper, 23 different
		  automatic evaluation metrics are evaluated on 10 different
		  datasets. Furthermore, the metrics are assessed in
		  different settings, to better qualify their respective
		  strengths and weaknesses. This comprehensive assessment
		  offers several takeaways pertaining to dialog evaluation
		  metrics in general. It also suggests how to best assess
		  evaluation metrics and indicates promising directions for
		  future work.}

		  know{''}) could correspond to a large variety of input
		  utterances. Previous generative conversational models
		  usually employ a single model to learn the relationship
		  between different utterance-response pairs, thus tend to
		  favor general and trivial responses which appear
		  frequently. To address this problem, we propose a novel
		  controlled response generation mechanism to handle
		  different utterance-response relationships in terms of
		  specificity. Specifically, we introduce an explicit
		  specificity control variable into a sequence-to-sequence
		  model, which interacts with the usage representation of
		  words through a Gaussian Kernel layer, to guide the model
		  to generate responses at different specificity levels. We
		  describe two ways to acquire distant labels for the
		  specificity control variable in learning. Empirical studies
		  show that our model can significantly outperform the
		  state-of-the-art response generation models under both
		  automatic and human evaluations.}

		  objectives on large text corpora has shown great success
		  when fine-tuned on downstream NLP tasks including text
		  summarization. However, pre-training objectives tailored
		  for abstractive text summarization have not been explored.
		  Furthermore there is a lack of systematic evaluation across
		  diverse domains. In this work, we propose pre-training
		  large Transformer-based encoder-decoder models on massive
		  text corpora with a new self-supervised objective. In
		  PEGASUS, important sentences are removed/masked from an
		  input document and are generated together as one output
		  sequence from the remaining sentences, similar to an
		  extractive summary. We evaluated our best PEGASUS model on
		  12 downstream summarization tasks spanning news, science,
		  stories, instructions, emails, patents, and legislative
		  bills. Experiments demonstrate it achieves state-of-the-art
		  performance on all 12 downstream datasets measured by ROUGE
		  scores. Our model also shows surprising performance on
		  low-resource summarization, surpassing previous
		  state-of-the-art results on 6 datasets with only 1000
		  examples. Finally we validated our results using human
		  evaluation and show that our model summaries achieve human
		  performance on multiple datasets.}
