Safety in terms of collision avoidance for multi-robot systems is a difficult
challenge under uncertainty, non-determinism and lack of complete information.
This paper aims to propose a collision avoidance method that accounts for both
measurement uncertainty and motion uncertainty. In particular, we propose
Probabilistic Safety Barrier Certificates (PrSBC) using Control Barrier
Functions to define the space of admissible control actions that are
probabilistically safe with formally provable theoretical guarantee. By
formulating the chance constrained safety set into deterministic control
constraints with PrSBC, the method entails minimally modifying an existing
controller to determine an alternative safe controller via quadratic
programming constrained to PrSBC constraints. The key advantage of the approach
is that no assumptions about the form of uncertainty are required other than
finite support, also enabling worst-case guarantees. We demonstrate
effectiveness of the approach through experiments on realistic simulation
environments.
