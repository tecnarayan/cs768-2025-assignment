	abstract = {An understanding of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) signal transduction is a key goal in the effort to provide a molecular basis for the lethal effect of LPS during septic shock and point the way to novel therapies. Rapid progress in this field during the last 6 years has resulted in the discovery of not only the receptor for LPS {\textendash} Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) {\textendash} but also in a better appreciation of the complexity of the signalling pathways activated by LPS. Soon after the discovery of TLR4, the formation of a receptor complex in response to LPS, consisting of dimerized TLR4 and MD-2, was described. Intracellular events following the formation of this receptor complex depend on different sets of adapters. An early response, which is dependent on MyD88 and MyD88-like adapter (Mal), leads to the activation of nuclear factor-$\kappa$B (NF-$\kappa$B). A later response to LPS makes use of TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-$\beta$ (TRIF) and TRIF-related adapter molecule (TRAM), and leads to the late activation of NF-$\kappa$B and IRF3, and to the induction of cytokines, chemokines, and other transcription factors. As LPS signal transduction is an area of intense research and rapid progress, this review is intended to sum up our present understanding of the events following LPS binding to TLR4, and we also attempt to create a model of the signalling pathways activated by LPS.},

The goal of this contribution is to perform a dimension reduction of such data, where the new directions should allow for interpretability. An approach named principal balances turned out to be successful for low dimensions. Here, the concept of sparse principal component analysis is proposed for constructing principal directions, the so-called sparse principal balances. They are sparse (contain many zeros), build an orthonormal basis in the sample space of the compositional data, are efficient for dimension reduction and are applicable to high-dimensional data.},

The most significant achievement of working within the CoDa analysis framework is that the implications of the constraints on the data are acknowledged and dealt with, not ignored. The full composition was reduced based on collinearity of elements, principal components analysis (PCA) and scalings from a backwards linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Thus, a descriptive subcomposition was used for the final discrimination, using LDA, and proved to be more successful than using the full composition. The classification based on the LDA model showed a mean error rate of 2.9\% when validated using a 10 repeat, three-fold cross-validation.

However, this comes at the cost of high technical noise, including cell-specific biases in capture efficiency and library generation. One strategy for removing these biases is to add a constant amount of spike-in RNA to each cell and to scale the observed expression values so that the coverage of spike-in transcripts is constant across cells. This approach has previously been criticized as its accuracy depends on the precise addition of spike-in RNA to each sample. Here, we perform mixture experiments using two different sets of spike-in RNA to quantify the variance in the amount of spike-in RNA added to each well in a plate-based protocol. We also obtain an upper bound on the variance due to differences in behavior between the two spike-in sets. We demonstrate that both factors are small contributors to the total technical variance and have only minor effects on downstream analyses, such as detection of highly variable genes and clustering. Our results suggest that scaling normalization using spike-in transcripts is reliable enough for routine use in single-cell RNA sequencing data analyses.},

Cell fusion experiments establish that increased cellular content itself can directly increase transcription. Quantitative analysis shows that this mechanism measures the ratio of cellular volume to DNA content, most likely through sequestration of a transcriptional factor to DNA. Analysis of transcriptional bursts reveals a separate mechanism for gene dosage compensation after DNA replication that enables proper transcriptional output during early and late S phase.

	abstract = {Background
RNA-seq is revolutionizing the way we study transcriptomes. mRNA can be surveyed without prior knowledge of gene transcripts. Alternative splicing of transcript isoforms and the identification of previously unknown exons are being reported. Initial reports of differences in exon usage, and splicing between samples as well as quantitative differences among samples are beginning to surface. Biological variation has been reported to be larger than technical variation. In addition, technical variation has been reported to be in line with expectations due to random sampling. However, strategies for dealing with technical variation will differ depending on the magnitude. The size of technical variance, and the role of sampling are examined in this manuscript.

Results
In this study three independent Solexa/Illumina experiments containing technical replicates are analyzed. When coverage is low, large disagreements between technical replicates are apparent. Exon detection between technical replicates is highly variable when the coverage is less than 5 reads per nucleotide and estimates of gene expression are more likely to disagree when coverage is low. Although large disagreements in the estimates of expression are observed at all levels of coverage.

Conclusions
Technical variability is too high to ignore. Technical variability results in inconsistent detection of exons at low levels of coverage. Further, the estimate of the relative abundance of a transcript can substantially disagree, even when coverage levels are high. This may be due to the low sampling fraction and if so, it will persist as an issue needing to be addressed in experimental design even as the next wave of technology produces larger numbers of reads. We provide practical recommendations for dealing with the technical variability, without dramatic cost increases.},

These residuals are the difference between the original observations and the predictions of them using less than a full set of principal components. Specifically, procedures are proposed for testing the residuals associated with a single observation vector and for an overall test for a group of observations. In this development, it is assumed that the underlying covariance matrix is known; this is reasonable for many quality control applications where the proposed procedures may be quite useful in detecting outliers in the data. A numerical example is included.},

	abstract = {Neuronal calcium sensor-1 (NCS-1) is a Ca(2+) sensor protein that has been implicated in the regulation of various aspects of neuronal development and neurotransmission. It exerts its effects through interactions with a range of target proteins one of which is interleukin receptor accessory protein like-1 (IL1RAPL1) protein. Mutations in IL1RAPL1 have recently been associated with autism spectrum disorders and a missense mutation (R102Q) on NCS-1 has been found in one individual with autism. We have examined the effect of this mutation on the structure and function of NCS-1. From use of NMR spectroscopy, it appeared that the R102Q affected the structure of the protein particularly with an increase in the extent of conformational exchange in the C-terminus of the protein. Despite this change NCS-1(R102Q) did not show changes in its affinity for Ca(2+) or binding to IL1RAPL1 and its intracellular localisation was unaffected. Assessment of NCS-1 dynamics indicated that it could rapidly cycle between cytosolic and membrane pools and that the cycling onto the plasma membrane was specifically changed in NCS-1(R102Q) with the loss of a Ca(2+) -dependent component. From these data we speculate that impairment of the normal cycling of NCS-1 by the R102Q mutation could have subtle effects on neuronal signalling and physiology in the developing and adult brain.},

The resulting rich data provide a major opportunity to develop an integrated picture of commonalities, differences, and emergent themes across tumour lineages. The Pan-Cancer initiative compares the first twelve tumour types profiled by TCGA. Analysis of the molecular aberrations and their functional roles across tumour types will teach us how to extend therapies effective in one cancer type to others with a similar genomic profile.},

Motivated by the recent theory on direct information sampling called compressed sensing (CS), we propose a framework for detecting anomalies from these large-scale data mining applications where the full information is not practically possible to obtain. Exploiting the fact that the intrinsic dimension of the data in these applications are typically small relative to the raw dimension and the fact that compressed sensing is capable of capturing most information with few measurements, our work show that spectral methods that used for volume anomaly detection can be directly applied to the CS data with guarantee on performance. Our theoretical contributions are supported by extensive experimental results on large datasets which show satisfactory performance.},

These sources of noise must be modeled and removed to accurately measure biological variability and to obtain correct statistical inference when performing high-throughput genomic analysis. We introduced surrogate variable analysis (sva) for estimating these artifacts by (i) identifying the part of the genomic data only affected by artifacts and (ii) estimating the artifacts with principal components or singular vectors of the subset of the data matrix. The resulting estimates of artifacts can be used in subsequent analyses as adjustment factors to correct analyses. Here I describe a version of the sva approach specifically created for count data or FPKMs from sequencing experiments based on appropriate data transformation. I also describe the addition of supervised sva (ssva) for using control probes to identify the part of the genomic data only affected by artifacts. I present a comparison between these versions of sva and other methods for batch effect estimation on simulated data, real count-based data and FPKM-based data. These updates are available through the sva Bioconductor package and I have made fully reproducible analysis using these methods available from: https://github.com/jtleek/svaseq.},

While these data offer new opportunities to identify the mechanisms underlying disease, the comparison of data from different sources remains challenging, due to differences in sample and data processing. Here, we developed a pipeline that processes and unifies RNA-seq data from different studies, which includes uniform realignment, gene expression quantification, and batch effect removal. We find that uniform alignment and quantification is not sufficient when combining RNA-seq data from different sources and that the removal of other batch effects is essential to facilitate data comparison. We have processed data from GTEx and TCGA and successfully corrected for study-specific biases, enabling comparative analysis between TCGA and GTEx.

The distance based on the major components that account for 50 \% of the total variation and the minor components with eigenvalues less than 0.20 is shown to work well.

	abstract = {With the surge of next generation high-throughput technologies, RNA-seq data is playing an increasingly important role in disease diagnosis, in which normalization is assumed as an essential procedure to produce comparable samples. Recent studies have seen different normalization methods proposed to remove various technical biases in RNA sequencing. However, there are no previous studies evaluating the impacts of normalization on RNA-seq disease diagnosis. In this study, we investigate this problem by analyzing structured big data: RNA-seq data acquired from the TCGA portal for its popularity in RNA-seq disease diagnosis. We propose a novel normalization effect test algorithm, diagnostic index (d-index), and data entropy to analyze and evaluate the impacts of normalization on RNA-seq disease diagnosis by using state-of-the-art machine learning models. Furthermore, we present an original visualization analysis to compare the performance of normalized data versus raw data. We have found that normalized data yields generally an equivalent or even lower level diagnosis than its raw data. Moreover, some normalization approaches (e.g. RPKM) even bring negative effects in disease diagnosis. On the other hand, raw data seems to have the potential to decipher pathological status better or at least comparable than when the data is normalized. Our visualization analysis also shows that some normalization methods even bring {\textquoteleft}outliers{\textquoteright}, which unavoidably decreases sample detectability in diagnosis. More importantly, our data entropy analysis shows that normalized data usually demonstrates equivalent or lower entropy values than raw data. Those data with high entropy values tend to achieve better diagnosis than those with low entropy values. In addition, we found that high-dimensional imbalance (HDI) data is unaffected by any normalization procedures in diagnosis, and fails almost all machine learning models by only recognizing majority types in spite of raw or normalized data. Our results suggest that normalized data may not demonstrate statistically significant advantages in disease diagnosis than its raw form. It further implies that normalization may not be an indispensable procedure in RNA-seq disease diagnosis or at least some normalization processes may not be. Instead, raw data may perform better for capturing more original transcriptome patterns in different pathological conditions.},

The early diagnosis and prognosis of a cancer type have become a necessity in cancer research, as it can facilitate the subsequent clinical management of patients. The importance of classifying cancer patients into high or low risk groups has led many research teams, from the biomedical and the bioinformatics field, to study the application of machine learning (ML) methods. Therefore, these techniques have been utilized as an aim to model the progression and treatment of cancerous conditions. In addition, the ability of ML tools to detect key features from complex datasets reveals their importance. A variety of these techniques, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Bayesian Networks (BNs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Decision Trees (DTs) have been widely applied in cancer research for the development of predictive models, resulting in effective and accurate decision making. Even though it is evident that the use of ML methods can improve our understanding of cancer progression, an appropriate level of validation is needed in order for these methods to be considered in the everyday clinical practice. In this work, we present a review of recent ML approaches employed in the modeling of cancer progression. The predictive models discussed here are based on various supervised ML techniques as well as on different input features and data samples. Given the growing trend on the application of ML methods in cancer research, we present here the most recent publications that employ these techniques as an aim to model cancer risk or patient outcomes.},

	abstract = {Mammography is the best available tool for screening for the early detection of breast cancer. Mammographic screening has been shown to be effective in reducing breast cancer mortality rates: screening programs have reduced mortality rates by 30{\textendash}70\%. Mammograms are difficult to interpret, especially in the screening context. The sensitivity of screening mammography is affected by image quality and the radiologist's level of expertise. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) technology can improve the performance of radiologists, by increasing sensitivity to rates comparable to those obtained by double reading, in a cost-effective manner. Current research is directed toward the development of digital imaging and image analysis systems that can detect mammographic features, classify them, and provide visual prompts to the radiologist. Radiologists would like the ability to change the contrast of a mammogram, either manually or with pre-selected settings. Computer techniques for detecting, classifying, and annotating diagnostic features on the images would be desirable. This paper presents an overview of digital image processing and pattern analysis techniques to address several areas in CAD of breast cancer, including: contrast enhancement, detection and analysis of calcifications, detection and analysis of masses and tumors, analysis of bilateral asymmetry, and detection of architectural distortion. Although a few commercial CAD systems have been released, the detection of subtle signs of breast cancer such as global bilateral asymmetry and focal architectural distortion remains a difficult problem. We present some of our recent works on the development of image processing and pattern analysis techniques for these applications.},

	abstract = {In the approach to compositional data analysis originated by John Aitchison, a set of linearly independent logratios (i.e., ratios of compositional parts, logarithmically transformed) explains all the variability in a compositional data set. Such a set of ratios can be represented by an acyclic connected graph of all the parts, with edges one less than the number of parts. There are many such candidate sets of ratios, each of which explains 100\% of the compositional logratio variance. A simple choice consists in using additive logratios, and it is demonstrated how to identify one set that can serve as a substitute for the original data set in the sense of best approximating the essential multivariate structure. When all pairwise ratios of parts are candidates for selection, a smaller set of ratios can be determined by automatic selection, but preferably assisted by expert knowledge, which explains as much variability as required to reveal the underlying structure of the data. Conventional univariate statistical summary measures as well as multivariate methods can be applied to these ratios. Such a selection of a small set of ratios also implies the choice of a subset of parts, that is, a subcomposition, which explains a maximum percentage of variance. This approach of ratio selection, designed to simplify the task of the practitioner, is illustrated on an archaeometric data set as well as three further data sets in an {\textquotedblleft}Appendix{\textquotedblright}. Comparisons are also made with existing proposals for selecting variables in compositional data analysis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Liver metastasis is common in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC), and is correlated with poor outcome. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs involved in cancer development and progression, but their role in CRC liver metastasis has not been extensively investigated.
RESULTS: Thirteen miRNAs were deregulated in pCRCs compared to their matched liver metastases. Seventeen miRNAs were chosen for validation, which confirmed significantly reduced expression of miR-99b-5p, miR-377 and miR-200c and increased expression of miR-196b-5p in the tissue of liver metastasis. Furthermore, miR-200c and miR-196b-5p were positively correlated with shorter overall survival in pCRC patients with liver metastasis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Firstly, affymetrix microarrays involving 1036 miRNAs were performed in two pairs of primary CRCs (pCRCs) and their matched liver metastases. Secondly, validation of the results was carried out on an independent cohort of 48 pairs of pCRCs and matched liver metastases using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assay.
CONCLUSIONS: We discovered a pCRC liver metastasis-specific miRNA panel including miR-377, miR-99b-5p, miR-200c and miR-196b-5p through intensive validation. These miRNAs may function as prognostic factors in patients with metastatic CRC.},

MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs involved in regulating normal physiological processes as well as cancer pathogenesis.

They can thus act as oncogenes or tumor suppressors depending on the function of their target genes. MicroRNAs have shown great promise for use in anti-metastatic cancer therapy.

MicroRNAs have been proposed as markers of the prognosis or treatment response in colorectal cancer. Recently, a 2-microRNA signature (let-7i and miR-10b) was proposed to identify colorectal cancer patients at risk of developing distant metastasis. We assessed the prognostic value of this signature and additional candidate microRNAs in an independent, clinically well-defined, prospectively collected cohort of primary colon cancer patients including stage I-II colon cancer without and stage III colon cancer with adjuvant treatment. The 2-microRNA signature specifically predicted hepatic recurrence in the stage I-II group, but not the overall ability to develop distant metastasis. The addition of miR-30b to the 2-microRNA signature allowed the prediction of both distant metastasis and hepatic recurrence in patients with stage I-II colon cancer who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy. Available gene expression data allowed us to associate miR-30b expression with axon guidance and let-7i expression with cell adhesion, migration, and motility.},

Compared to the first two categories, the weighting methods have been underutilized even though they are usually the simplest ones. In this article, we constructed three different genes' connectivity information-based weights for each gene and then conducted feature selection upon the resulting weighted gene expression profiles. Using both simulations and a real-world application, we have demonstrated that when the data-driven connectivity information constructed from the data of specific disease under study is considered, the resulting weighted gene expression profiles slightly outperform the original expression profiles. In summary, a big challenge faced by the weighting method is how to estimate pathway knowledge-based weights more accurately and precisely. Only until the issue is conquered successfully will wide utilization of the weighting methods be impossible.},

The estimates have the attractive property of being invariant under groupwise orthogonal reparameterizations. We extend the group lasso to logistic regression models and present an efficient algorithm, that is especially suitable for high dimensional problems, which can also be applied to generalized linear models to solve the corresponding convex optimization problem. The group lasso estimator for logistic regression is shown to be statistically consistent even if the number of predictors is much larger than sample size but with sparse true underlying structure. We further use a two-stage procedure which aims for sparser models than the group lasso, leading to improved prediction performance for some cases. Moreover, owing to the two-stage nature, the estimates can be constructed to be hierarchical. The methods are used on simulated and real data sets about splice site detection in DNA sequences.},

	abstract = {Background
A tremendous amount of efforts have been devoted to identifying genes for diagnosis and prognosis of diseases using microarray gene expression data. It has been demonstrated that gene expression data have cluster structure, where the clusters consist of co-regulated genes which tend to have coordinated functions. However, most available statistical methods for gene selection do not take into consideration the cluster structure.

Results
We propose a supervised group Lasso approach that takes into account the cluster structure in gene expression data for gene selection and predictive model building. For gene expression data without biological cluster information, we first divide genes into clusters using the K-means approach and determine the optimal number of clusters using the Gap method. The supervised group Lasso consists of two steps. In the first step, we identify important genes within each cluster using the Lasso method. In the second step, we select important clusters using the group Lasso. Tuning parameters are determined using V-fold cross validation at both steps to allow for further flexibility. Prediction performance is evaluated using leave-one-out cross validation. We apply the proposed method to disease classification and survival analysis with microarray data.

Conclusion
We analyze four microarray data sets using the proposed approach: two cancer data sets with binary cancer occurrence as outcomes and two lymphoma data sets with survival outcomes. The results show that the proposed approach is capable of identifying a small number of influential gene clusters and important genes within those clusters, and has better prediction performance than existing methods.},

While these data offer new opportunities to identify the mechanisms underlying disease, the comparison of data from different sources remains challenging, due to differences in sample and data processing. Here, we developed a pipeline that processes and unifies RNA-seq data from different studies, which includes uniform realignment, gene expression quantification, and batch effect removal. We find that uniform alignment and quantification is not sufficient when combining RNA-seq data from different sources and that the removal of other batch effects is essential to facilitate data comparison.

APE provides both utility functions for reading and writing data and manipulating phylogenetic trees, as well as several advanced methods for phylogenetic and evolutionary analysis (e.g. comparative and population genetic methods). APE takes advantage of the many R functions for statistics and graphics, and also provides a flexible framework for developing and implementing further statistical methods for the analysis of evolutionary processes.

	abstract = {Amalgamation of parts of a composition has been extensively used as a technique of analysis to achieve reduced dimension, as was discussed during the CoDaWork'03 meeting (Girona, Spain, 2003). It was shown to be a non-linear operation in the simplex that does not preserve distances under perturbation. The discussion motivated the introduction in the present paper of concepts such as group of parts, balance between groups, and sequential binary partition, which are intended to provide tools of compositional data analysis for dimension reduction. Key concepts underlying this development are the established tools of subcomposition, coordinates in an orthogonal basis of the simplex, balancing element and, in general, the Aitchison geometry in the simplex. Main new results are: a method to analyze grouped parts of a compositional vector through the adequate coordinates in an ad hoc orthonormal basis; and the study of balances of groups of parts (inter-group analysis) as an orthogonal projection similar to that used in standard subcompositional analysis (intra-group analysis). A simulated example compares results when testing equal centers of two populations using amalgamated parts and balances; it shows that, in certain circumstances, results from both analysis can disagree.},

In the present study, we sought to combine two discovery-based approaches: (1) white matter query language was used to parcellate the brain's white matter into tracts connecting pairs of 34, bilateral cortical regions and (2) the diffusion imaging characteristics of the resulting tracts were analyzed using a machine-learning method called support vector machine in order to optimize the selection of a set of imaging features that maximally discriminated 22q11.2DS and comparison subjects. With this unique approach, we both confirmed previously-recognized 22q11.2DS-related abnormalities in the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), and identified, for the first time, 22q11.2DS-related anomalies in the middle longitudinal fascicle and the extreme capsule, which may have been overlooked in previous, hypothesis-guided studies.

We demonstrate that analyses of community-level structure can be applied to PhILR transformed data with performance on benchmarks rivaling or surpassing standard tools. Additionally, by decomposing distance in the PhILR transformed space, we identified neighboring clades that may have adapted to distinct human body sites. Decomposing variance revealed that covariation of bacterial clades within human body sites increases with phylogenetic relatedness. Together, these findings illustrate how the PhILR transform combines statistical and phylogenetic models to overcome compositional data challenges and enable evolutionary insights relevant to microbial communities.},

	abstract = {Compositional data analysis requires selecting an orthonormal basis with which to work on coordinates. In most cases this selection is based on a data driven criterion. Principal component analysis provides bases that are, in general, functions of all the original parts, each with a different weight hindering their interpretation. For interpretative purposes, it would be better to have each basis component as a ratio or balance of the geometric means of two groups of parts, leaving irrelevant parts with a zero weight. This is the role of principal balances, defined as a sequence of orthonormal balances which successively maximize the explained variance in a data set. The new algorithm to compute principal balances requires an exhaustive search along all the possible sets of orthonormal balances. To reduce computational time, the sets of possible partitions for up to 15 parts are stored. Two other suboptimal, but feasible, algorithms are also introduced: (i) a new search for balances following a constrained principal component approach and (ii) the hierarchical cluster analysis of variables. The latter is a new approach based on the relation between the variation matrix and the Aitchison distance. The properties and performance of these three algorithms are illustrated using a typical data set of geochemical compositions and a simulation exercise.},

	abstract = {Advances in sequencing technologies have enabled novel insights into microbial niche differentiation, from analyzing environmental samples to understanding human diseases and informing dietary studies. However, identifying the microbial taxa that differentiate these samples can be challenging. These issues stem from the compositional nature of 16S rRNA gene data (or, more generally, taxon or functional gene data); the changes in the relative abundance of one taxon influence the apparent abundances of the others. Here we acknowledge that inferring properties of individual bacteria is a difficult problem and instead introduce the concept of balances to infer meaningful properties of subcommunities, rather than properties of individual species. We show that balances can yield insights about niche differentiation across multiple microbial environments, including soil environments and lung sputum. These techniques have the potential to reshape how we carry out future ecological analyses aimed at revealing differences in relative taxonomic abundances across different samples.
IMPORTANCE By explicitly accounting for the compositional nature of 16S rRNA gene data through the concept of balances, balance trees yield novel biological insights into niche differentiation.

In this work we focus on the identification of microbial signatures, groups of microbial taxa that are predictive of a phenotype of interest.

Thus, instead of defining a microbial signature as a linear combination in real space corresponding to the abundances of a group of taxa, we consider microbial signatures given by the geometric means of data from two groups of taxa whose relative abundances, or balance, are associated with the response variable of interest. In this work we present \textit{selbal}, a greedy stepwise algorithm for selection of balances or microbial signatures that preserves the principles of compositional data analysis.

	abstract = {Objective
Feature selection is a technique widely used in data mining. The aim is to select the best subset of features relevant to the problem being considered. In this paper, we consider feature selection for the classification of gene datasets. Gene data is usually composed of just a few dozen objects described by thousands of features. For this kind of data, it is easy to find a model that fits the learning data. However, it is not easy to find one that will simultaneously evaluate new data equally well as learning data. This overfitting issue is well known as regards classification and regression, but it also applies to feature selection.
Methods and materials
We address this problem and investigate its importance in an empirical study of four feature selection methods applied to seven high-dimensional gene datasets. We chose datasets that are well studied in the literature{\textemdash}colon cancer, leukemia and breast cancer. All the datasets are characterized by a significant number of features and the presence of exactly two decision classes. The feature selection methods used are ReliefF, minimum redundancy maximum relevance, support vector machine-recursive feature elimination and relaxed linear separability.
Results
Our main result reveals the existence of positive feature selection bias in all 28 experiments (7 datasets and 4 feature selection methods). Bias was calculated as the difference between validation and test accuracies and ranges from 2.6\% to as much as 41.67\%. The validation accuracy (biased accuracy) was calculated on the same dataset on which the feature selection was performed. The test accuracy was calculated for data that was not used for feature selection (by so called external cross-validation).
Conclusions
This work provides evidence that using the same dataset for feature selection and learning is not appropriate. We recommend using cross-validation for feature selection in order to reduce selection bias.},

	abstract = {With accumulating research on the interconnections among different types of genomic regulations, researchers have found that multidimensional genomic studies outperform one-dimensional studies in multiple aspects. Among many sources of multidimensional genomic data, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) provides the public with comprehensive profiling data on {\textgreater}30 cancer types, making it an ideal test bed for conducting and comparing different analyses. In this article, the analysis goal is to apply several existing methods and associate multidimensional genomic measurements with cancer outcomes in particular prognosis, with special focus on the predictive power of genomic signatures. We exploit clinical data and four types of genomic measurement including mRNA gene expression, DNA methylation, microRNA and copy number alterations for breast invasive carcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, acute myeloid leukemia and lung squamous cell carcinoma collected by TCGA. To accommodate the high dimensionality, we extract important features using Principal Component Analysis, Partial Least Squares and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso), which are representative of dimension reduction and variable selection techniques and have been extensively adopted, and fit Cox survival models with combined important features. We calibrate the predictive power of each type of genomic measurement for the prognosis of four cancer types and find that the results vary across cancers. Our analysis also suggests that for most of the cancers in our study and the adopted methods, there is no substantial improvement in prediction when adding other genomic measurement after gene expression and clinical covariates have been included in the model. This is consistent with the findings that molecular features measured at the transcription level affect clinical outcomes more directly than those measured at the DNA/epigenetic level.},

	abstract = {A causal role of mutations in multiple general transcription factors in neurodevelopmental disorders including autism suggested that alterations in global levels of gene expression regulation might also relate to disease risk in sporadic cases of autism. This premise can be tested by evaluating for changes in the overall distribution of gene expression levels. For instance, in mice, variability in hippocampal-dependent behaviors was associated with variability in the pattern of the overall distribution of gene expression levels, as assessed by variance in the distribution of gene expression levels in the hippocampus. We hypothesized that a similar change in variance might be found in children with autism. Gene expression microarrays covering greater than 47,000 unique RNA transcripts were done on RNA from peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) of children with autism (n?=?82) and controls (n?=?64). Variance in the distribution of gene expression levels from each microarray was compared between groups of children. Also tested was whether a risk factor for autism, increased paternal age, was associated with variance. A decrease in the variance in the distribution of gene expression levels in PBL was associated with the diagnosis of autism and a risk factor for autism, increased paternal age. Traditional approaches to microarray analysis of gene expression suggested a possible mechanism for decreased variance in gene expression. Gene expression pathways involved in transcriptional regulation were down-regulated in the blood of children with autism and children of older fathers. Thus, results from global and gene specific approaches to studying microarray data were complimentary and supported the hypothesis that alterations at the global level of gene expression regulation are related to autism and increased paternal age. Global regulation of transcription, thus, represents a possible point of convergence for multiple etiologies of autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders.},

	abstract = {Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) is a spectrum of highly heritable neurodevelopmental disorders in which known mutations contribute to disease risk in 20\% of cases. Here, we report the results of the largest blood transcriptome study to date that aims to identify differences in 170 ASD cases and 115 age/sex-matched controls and to evaluate the utility of gene expression profiling as a tool to aid in the diagnosis of ASD. The differentially expressed genes were enriched for the neurotrophin signaling, long-term potentiation/depression, and notch signaling pathways. We developed a 55-gene prediction model, using a cross-validation strategy, on a sample cohort of 66 male ASD cases and 33 age-matched male controls (P1). Subsequently, 104 ASD cases and 82 controls were recruited and used as a validation set (P2). This 55-gene expression signature achieved 68\% classification accuracy with the validation cohort (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC): 0.70 [95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.62-0.77]). Not surprisingly, our prediction model that was built and trained with male samples performed well for males (AUC 0.73, 95\% CI 0.65-0.82), but not for female samples (AUC 0.51, 95\% CI 0.36-0.67). The 55-gene signature also performed robustly when the prediction model was trained with P2 male samples to classify P1 samples (AUC 0.69, 95\% CI 0.58-0.80). Our result suggests that the use of blood expression profiling for ASD detection may be feasible. Further study is required to determine the age at which such a test should be deployed, and what genetic characteristics of ASD can be identified.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Parkinson disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the accumulation of alpha-synuclein (SNCA) and other proteins in aggregates termed "Lewy Bodies" within neurons. PD has both genetic and environmental risk factors, and while processes leading to aberrant protein aggregation are unknown, past work points to abnormal levels of SNCA and other proteins. Although several genome-wide studies have been performed for PD, these have focused on DNA sequence variants by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and on RNA levels (microarray transcriptomics), while genome-wide proteomics analysis has been lacking.
METHODS: This study employed two state-of-the-art technologies, three-stage Mass Spectrometry Tandem Mass Tag Proteomics (12 PD, 12 controls) and RNA-sequencing transcriptomics (29 PD, 44 controls), evaluated in the context of PD GWAS implicated loci and microarray transcriptomics (19 PD, 24 controls). The technologies applied for this study were performed in a set of overlapping prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area 9) samples obtained from PD patients and sex and age similar neurologically healthy controls.
RESULTS: After appropriate filters, proteomics robustly identified 3558 unique proteins, with 283 of these (7.9 \%) significantly different between PD and controls (q-value {\textless} 0.05). RNA-sequencing identified 17,580 protein-coding genes, with 1095 of these (6.2 \%) significantly different (FDR p-value {\textless} 0.05); only 166 of the FDR significant protein-coding genes (0.94 \%) were present among the 3558 proteins characterized. Of these 166, eight genes (4.8 \%) were significant in both studies, with the same direction of effect. Functional enrichment analysis of the proteomics results strongly supports mitochondrial-related pathways, while comparable analysis of the RNA-sequencing results implicates protein folding pathways and metallothioneins. Ten of the implicated genes or proteins co-localized to GWAS loci. Evidence implicating SNCA was stronger in proteomics than in RNA-sequencing analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: We report the largest analysis of proteomics in PD to date, and the first to combine this technology with RNA-sequencing to investigate GWAS implicated loci. Notably, differentially expressed protein-coding genes were more likely to not be characterized in the proteomics analysis, which lessens the ability to compare across platforms. Combining multiple genome-wide platforms offers novel insights into the pathological processes responsible for this disease by identifying pathways implicated across methodologies.},

The overall correlation between mRNA and protein abundances across all conditions was low (0.46), but for differentially expressed proteins (n~= 202), the median mRNA-protein correlation was 0.88. We used these data to model translation efficiencies and found that they vary more than 400-fold between genes. Non-linear regression analysis detected that mRNA abundance and translation elongation were the dominant factors controlling protein synthesis, explaining 61\% and 15\% of its variance.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Peripheral inflammation is often associated with major depressive disorder (MDD), and immunological biomarkers of depression remain a focus of investigation.
METHODS: We used microarray data on whole blood from two independent case-control studies of MDD: the GlaxoSmithKline-High-Throughput Disease-specific target Identification Program [GSK-HiTDiP] study (113 patients and 57 healthy control subjects) and the Janssen-Brain Resource Company study (94 patients and 100 control subjects). Genome-wide differential gene expression analysis (18,863 probes) resulted in a p value for each gene in each study. A Bayesian method identified the largest p-value threshold (q~=~.025) associated with twice the number of genes differentially expressed in both studies compared with the number of coincidental case-control differences expected by chance.
RESULTS: A total of 165 genes were differentially expressed in both studies with concordant direction of fold change. The 90 genes overexpressed (or UP genes) in MDD were significantly enriched for immune response to infection, were concentrated in a module of the gene coexpression network associated with innate immunity, and included clusters of genes with correlated expression in monocytes, monocyte-derived dendritic cells, and neutrophils. In contrast, the 75 genes underexpressed (or DOWN genes) in MDD were associated with the adaptive immune response and included clusters of genes with correlated expression in T cells, natural killer cells, and erythroblasts. Consistently, the MDD patients with overexpression of UP genes also had underexpression of DOWN genes (correlation {\textgreater} .70 in both studies).
CONCLUSIONS: MDD was replicably associated with proinflammatory activation of the peripheral innate immune system, coupled with relative inactivation of the adaptive immune system, indicating the potential of transcriptional biomarkers for immunological stratification of patients with depression.},

We apply our methods to samples from four families with multiple cases of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Analysis of intra- and inter-individual variation demonstrates that family membership has a pronounced effect on the structural and functional composition of the gastrointestinal microbiome. In the context of T1DM, consistent taxonomic differences were absent across families, but certain human exocrine pancreatic proteins were found at lower levels. The associated microbial functional signatures were linked to metabolic traits in distinct taxa.

	abstract = {The gender difference in cancer susceptibility is one of the most consistent findings in cancer epidemiology. Hematologic malignancies are generally more common in males and this can be generalized to most other cancers. Similar gender differences in non-malignant diseases including autoimmunity, are attributed to hormonal or behavioral differences. Even in early childhood, however, where these differences would not apply, there are differences in cancer incidence between males and females. In childhood, few cancers are more common in females, but overall, males have higher susceptibility. In Hodgkin lymphoma, the gender ratio reverses toward adolescence. The pattern that autoimmune disorders are more common in females, but cancer and infections in males suggests that the known differences in immunity may be responsible for this dichotomy. Besides immune surveillance, genome surveillance mechanisms also differ in efficiency between males and females. Other obvious differences include hormonal ones and the number of X chromosomes. Some of the differences may even originate from exposures during prenatal development. This review will summarize well-documented examples of gender effect in cancer susceptibility, discuss methodological issues in exploration of gender differences, and present documented or speculated mechanisms. The gender differential in susceptibility can give important clues for the etiology of cancers and should be examined in all genetic and non-genetic association studies.},

	abstract = {Background: Protein-coding RNAs (mRNA) have been the primary target of most transcriptome studies in the past, but in recent years, attention has expanded to include long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA). lncRNAs are typically expressed at low levels, and are inherently highly variable. This is a fundamental challenge for differential expression (DE) analysis. In this study, the performance of 14 popular tools for testing DE in RNA-seq data along with their normalization methods is comprehensively evaluated, with a particular focus on lncRNAs and low abundant mRNAs. Results: Thirteen performance metrics were used to evaluate DE tools and normalization methods using simulations and analyses of six diverse RNA-seq datasets. Non-parametric procedures are used to simulate gene expression data in such a way that realistic levels of expression and variability are preserved in the simulated data. Throughout the assessment, we kept track of the results for mRNA and lncRNA separately. All statistical models exhibited inferior performance for lncRNAs compared to mRNAs across all simulated scenarios and analysis of benchmark RNA-seq datasets. No single tool uniformly outperformed the others. Conclusion: Overall, the linear modeling with empirical Bayes moderation (limma) and the nonparametric approach (SAMSeq) showed best performance: good control of the false discovery rate (FDR) and reasonable sensitivity. However, for achieving a sensitivity of at least 50{\textbackslash}\%, more than 80 samples are required when studying expression levels in a realistic clinical settings such as in cancer research. About half of the methods showed severe excess of false discoveries, making these methods unreliable for differential expression analysis and jeopardizing reproducible science.

We conducted multi-omic phenotyping of healthy subjects (N=136), in order to investigate the interaction between diet, the microbiome, and the metabolome in a cross-sectional sample. We analyzed the nutrient composition of self-reported diet (3-day food records and food frequency questionnaires). We profiled the gut and oral microbiome (16S rRNA) from stool and saliva, and applied metabolomic profiling to plasma and stool samples in a subset of individuals (N=75). We analyzed these multi-omic data to investigate the relationship between diet, the microbiome, and the gut and circulating metabolome. On a global level, we observed significant relationships, particularly between long-term diet, the gut microbiome and the metabolome. Intake of plant-derived nutrients as well as consumption of artificial sweeteners were associated with significant differences in circulating metabolites, particularly bile acids, which were dependent on gut enterotype, indicating that microbiome composition mediates the effect of diet on host physiology. Our analysis identifies dietary compounds and phytochemicals that may modulate bacterial abundance within the gut and interact with microbiome composition to alter host metabolism.},

The aetiology of IBD is partly attributed to a deregulated immune response to gut microbiome dysbiosis. Cross-sectional studies have revealed microbial signatures for different IBD subtypes, including ulcerative colitis, colonic Crohn's disease and ileal Crohn's disease. Although IBD is dynamic, microbiome studies have primarily focused on single time points or a few individuals. Here, we dissect the long-term dynamic behaviour of the gut microbiome in IBD and differentiate this from normal variation. Microbiomes of IBD subjects fluctuate more than those of healthy individuals, based on deviation from a newly defined healthy plane (HP). Ileal Crohn's disease subjects deviated most from the HP, especially subjects with surgical resection. Intriguingly, the microbiomes of some IBD subjects periodically visited the HP then deviated away from it. Inflammation was not directly correlated with distance to the healthy plane, but there was some correlation between observed dramatic fluctuations in the gut microbiome and intensified medication due to a flare of the disease. These results will help guide therapies that will redirect the gut microbiome towards a healthy state and maintain remission in IBD.},

The gut microbiota closely interacts with the host immune system, but its functional impact in CD is unclear.

Here we employed metagenomic shotgun sequencing to provide a detailed characterization of the compositional and functional features of the CD microbiota, comprising also unannotated bacteria, and investigated its modulation by exclusive enteral nutrition. Based on signature taxa, CD microbiotas clustered into 2 distinct metacommunities, indicating individual variability in CD microbiome structure. Metacommunity-specific functional shifts in CD showed enrichment in producers of the pro-inflammatory hexa-acylated lipopolysaccharide variant and a reduction in the potential to synthesize short-chain fatty acids. Disruption of ecological networks was evident in CD, coupled with reduction in growth rates of many bacterial species. Short-term exclusive enteral nutrition elicited limited impact on the overall composition of the CD microbiota, although functional changes occurred following treatment. The microbiotas in CD patients can be stratified into 2 distinct metacommunities, with the most severely perturbed metacommunity exhibiting functional potentials that deviate markedly from that of the healthy individuals, with possible implication in relation to CD pathogenesis.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A decade of microbiome studies has linked IBD to an alteration in the gut microbial community of genetically predisposed subjects. However, existing profiles of gut microbiome dysbiosis in adult IBD patients are inconsistent among published studies, and did not allow the identification of microbial signatures for CD and UC. Here, we aimed to compare the faecal microbiome of CD with patients having UC and with non-IBD subjects in a longitudinal study.
DESIGN: We analysed a cohort of 2045 non-IBD and IBD faecal samples from four countries (Spain, Belgium, the UK and Germany), applied a 16S rRNA sequencing approach and analysed a total dataset of 115 million sequences.
RESULTS: In the Spanish cohort, dysbiosis was found significantly greater in patients with CD than with UC, as shown by a more reduced diversity, a less stable microbial community and eight microbial groups were proposed as a specific microbial signature for CD. Tested against the whole cohort, the signature achieved an overall sensitivity of 80\% and a specificity of 94\%, 94\%, 89\% and 91\% for the detection of CD versus healthy controls, patients with anorexia, IBS and UC, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Although UC and CD share many epidemiologic, immunologic, therapeutic and clinical features, our results showed that they are two distinct subtypes of IBD at the microbiome level. For the first time, we are proposing microbiomarkers to discriminate between CD and non-CD independently of geographical regions.},

We propose that a microbiome's interaction with its human host is not necessarily dependent upon the presence or absence of particular bacterial species, but instead is dependent on its community metabolome; an emergent property of the microbiome.
RESULTS: Using data from a previously published, longitudinal study of microbiome populations of the human gut, we extrapolated information about microbiome community enzyme profiles and metabolome models. Using machine learning techniques, we demonstrated that the aggregate predicted community enzyme function profiles and modeled metabolomes of a microbiome are more predictive of dysbiosis than either observed microbiome community composition or predicted enzyme function profiles.
CONCLUSIONS: Specific enzyme functions and metabolites predictive of dysbiosis provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of microbiome-host interactions. The ability to use machine learning to predict dysbiosis from microbiome community interaction data provides a potentially powerful tool for understanding the links between the human microbiome and human health, pointing to potential microbiome-based diagnostics and therapeutic interventions.},

	abstract = {Background Pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is challenging to diagnose because of the non-specificity of symptoms; an unequivocal diagnosis can only be made using colonoscopy, which clinicians are reluctant to recommend for children. Diagnosis of pediatric IBD is therefore frequently delayed, leading to inappropriate treatment plans and poor outcomes. We investigated the use of 16S rRNA sequencing of fecal samples and new analytical methods to assess differences in the microbiota of children with IBD and other gastrointestinal disorders. Methodology/Principal Findings We applied synthetic learning in microbial ecology (SLiME) analysis to 16S sequencing data obtained from i) published surveys of microbiota diversity in IBD and ii) fecal samples from 91 children and young adults who were treated in the gastroenterology program of Children{\textquoteright}s Hospital (Boston, USA). The developed method accurately distinguished control samples from those of patients with IBD; the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) value was 0.83 (corresponding to 80.3\% sensitivity and 69.7\% specificity at a set threshold). The accuracy was maintained among data sets collected by different sampling and sequencing methods. The method identified taxa associated with disease states and distinguished patients with Crohn{\textquoteright}s disease from those with ulcerative colitis with reasonable accuracy. The findings were validated using samples from an additional group of 68 patients; the validation test identified patients with IBD with an AUC value of 0.84 (e.g. 92\% sensitivity, 58.5\% specificity). Conclusions/Significance Microbiome-based diagnostics can distinguish pediatric patients with IBD from patients with similar symptoms. Although this test can not replace endoscopy and histological examination as diagnostic tools, classification based on microbial diversity is an effective complementary technique for IBD detection in pediatric patients.},

Interindividual variation and an inability to detect less abundant bacteria have made it difficult to correlate specific bacteria with disease.
METHODS: We used 454 pyrotag sequencing to determine the compositions of microbial communities in feces samples collected from a cohort of 40 twin pairs who were concordant or discordant for CD or UC, and in mucosal samples from a subset of the cohort. The cohort primarily comprised patients who were in remission, but also some with active disease.
RESULTS: The profiles of the microbial community differed with disease phenotypes; relative amounts of bacterial populations correlated with IBD phenotypes. The microbial compositions of individuals with CD differed from those of healthy individuals, but were similar between healthy individuals and individuals with UC. Profiles from individuals with CD that predominantly involved the ileum differed from those with CD that predominantly involved the colon; several bacterial populations increased or decreased with disease type. Changes specific to patients with ileal CD included the disappearance of core bacteria, such as Faecalibacterium and Roseburia, and increased amounts of Enterobacteriaceae and Ruminococcus gnavus.
CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial populations differ in abundance among individuals with different phenotypes of CD. Specific species of bacteria are associated with ileal CD; further studies should investigate their role in pathogenesis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis result from alterations in intestinal microbes and the immune system. However, the precise dysfunctions of microbial metabolism in the gastrointestinal microbiome during IBD remain unclear. We analyzed the microbiota of intestinal biopsies and stool samples from 231 IBD and healthy subjects by 16S gene pyrosequencing and followed up a subset using shotgun metagenomics. Gene and pathway composition were assessed, based on 16S data from phylogenetically-related reference genomes, and associated using sparse multivariate linear modeling with medications, environmental factors, and IBD status.
RESULTS: Firmicutes and Enterobacteriaceae abundances were associated with disease status as expected, but also with treatment and subject characteristics. Microbial function, though, was more consistently perturbed than composition, with 12\% of analyzed pathways changed compared with 2\% of genera. We identified major shifts in oxidative stress pathways, as well as decreased carbohydrate metabolism and amino acid biosynthesis in favor of nutrient transport and uptake. The microbiome of ileal Crohn's disease was notable for increases in virulence and secretion pathways.
CONCLUSIONS: This inferred functional metagenomic information provides the first insights into community-wide microbial processes and pathways that underpin IBD pathogenesis.},

An axis defined by an increased abundance in bacteria which include~Enterobacteriaceae, Pasteurellacaea, Veillonellaceae, and Fusobacteriaceae, and decreased abundance in Erysipelotrichales, Bacteroidales, and Clostridiales, correlates strongly with disease status. Microbiome comparison between CD patients with and without antibiotic exposure indicates that antibiotic use amplifies the microbial dysbiosis associated with CD.

An association between the increased incidence of IBD and environmental factors linked to socioeconomic development has been persistently detected in different parts of the world. The lifestyle in developed countries might impair the natural patterns of microbial colonization of the human gut. The interaction of microbes with mucosal immune compartments in the gut seems to have a major role in priming and regulating immunity. In IBD, mucosal lesions are generated by an excessive or dysregulated immune response against commensal microbes in the gut. In individuals with a genetic susceptibility to IBD, abnormal microbial colonization of the gastrointestinal tract might be the origin of such dysregulation. Developments in gene-sequencing technologies, as well as increased availability of powerful bioinformatic tools, have enabled novel insights into the microbial composition of the human gut microbiota and the effect of microbial communities on human physiology and disease. Studies that used these technologies indicate that dysbiosis (that is, abnormal microbiota composition) and decreased complexity of the gut microbial ecosystem are common features in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. Whether such changes are a cause or a consequence of the disease remains to be elucidated.},

Enhanced technologies can increase our understanding of the interactions between the host and its resident microbiota and their respective roles in IBD from both a large-scale pathway view and at the metabolic level. We review important microbiome studies of patients with IBD and describe what we have learned about the mechanisms of intestinal microbiota dysfunction.

While IBD has been associated with dramatic changes in the gut microbiota, changes in the gut metabolome-the molecular interface between host and microbiota-are less well understood. To address this gap, we performed untargeted metabolomic and shotgun metagenomic profiling of cross-sectional stool samples from discovery (n = 155) and validation (n = 65) cohorts of CD, UC and non-IBD control patients. Metabolomic and metagenomic profiles were broadly correlated with faecal calprotectin levels (a measure of gut inflammation). Across {\textgreater}8,000 measured metabolite features, we identified chemicals and chemical classes that were differentially abundant in IBD, including enrichments for sphingolipids and bile acids, and depletions for triacylglycerols and tetrapyrroles. While {\textgreater} 50\% of differentially abundant metabolite features were uncharacterized, many could be assigned putative roles through metabolomic 'guilt by association' (covariation with known metabolites). Differentially abundant species and functions from the metagenomic profiles reflected adaptation to oxidative stress in the IBD gut, and were individually consistent with previous findings. Integrating these data, however, we identified 122 robust associations between differentially abundant species and well-characterized differentially abundant metabolites, indicating possible mechanistic relationships that are perturbed in IBD. Finally, we found that metabolome- and metagenome-based classifiers of IBD status were highly accurate and, like the vast majority of individual trends, generalized well to the independent validation cohort. Our findings thus provide an improved understanding of perturbations of the microbiome-metabolome interface in IBD, including identification of many potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets.},

We examine applications of deep learning to a variety of biomedical problems-patient classification, fundamental biological processes and treatment of patients-and discuss whether deep learning will be able to transform these tasks or if the biomedical sphere poses unique challenges. Following from an extensive literature review, we find that deep learning has yet to revolutionize biomedicine or definitively resolve any of the most pressing challenges in the field, but promising advances have been made on the prior state of the art. Even though improvements over previous baselines have been modest in general, the recent progress indicates that deep learning methods will provide valuable means for speeding up or aiding human investigation. Though progress has been made linking a specific neural network's prediction to input features, understanding how users should interpret these models to make testable hypotheses about the system under study remains an open challenge. Furthermore, the limited amount of labelled data for training presents problems in some domains, as do legal and privacy constraints on work with sensitive health records. Nonetheless, we foresee deep learning enabling changes at both bench and bedside with the potential to transform several areas of biology and medicine.},

In total, LinkedOmics has more than a billion data points. To allow comprehensive analysis of these data, we developed three analysis modules in the LinkedOmics web application. The LinkFinder module allows flexible exploration of associations between a molecular or clinical attribute of interest and all other attributes, providing the opportunity to analyze and visualize associations between billions of attribute pairs for each cancer cohort. The LinkCompare module enables easy comparison of the associations identified by LinkFinder, which is particularly useful in multi-omics and pan-cancer analyses. The LinkInterpreter module transforms identified associations into biological understanding through pathway and network analysis. Using five case studies, we demonstrate that LinkedOmics provides a unique platform for biologists and clinicians to access, analyze and compare cancer multi-omics data within and across tumor types.

	abstract = {Microbiota composition and its metabolic capacity are very important for host health. Evidence suggests that gut microbiome is involved in the metabolites production by host-microbiome interaction. These metabolites can be absorbed in blood and excreted in exhaled air. Although, profiles of gut microbiota and exhaled metabolites were associated with gastrointestinal diseases, a direct link between them has not yet been investigated. The aim of the study was to investigate the relation between volatiles in breath and gut microbiome in active and quiescent Crohn's disease (CD) via a multivariate statistical approach. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) was used to assess the relation between exhaled metabolites and faecal bacterial species. From 68 CD patients, 184 repeated faecal and breath samples were collected (92 active and 92 quiescent disease). The microbiota composition was assessed by the pyrosequencing of the 16 S rRNA V1-V3 gene region and breath metabolites by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. In active disease, CCA analysis identified 18 metabolites significantly correlated with 19 faecal bacterial taxa (R~=~0.91 p-value 3.5*10-4). In quiescent disease 17 volatile metabolites were correlated with 17 bacterial taxa (R~=~0.96 p-value 2.8*10-4). Nine metabolites and three bacteria taxa overlapped in active and inactive CD. This is the first study that shows a significant relation between gut microbiome and exhaled metabolites, and was found to differ between active and quiescent CD, indicating various underlying mechanisms. Unravelling this link is essential to increase our understanding on the functional effects of the microbiome and may provide new leads for microbiome-targeted intervention.},

Along with the speedy development of omics studies, there is an increasing interest in discovering the biological associations between microbes and host metabolites. This raises the need of finding proper statistical methods that facilitate the correlation analysis across different omics studies. Here, we comprehensively evaluated six different correlation methods, i.e., Pearson correlation, Spearman correlation, Sparse Correlations for Compositional data (SparCC), Correlation inference for Compositional data through Lasso (CCLasso), Mutual Information Coefficient (MIC), and Cosine similarity methods, for the correlations detection between microbes and metabolites. Three simulated and two real-world data sets (from public databases and our lab) were used to examine the performance of each method regarding its specificity, sensitivity, similarity, accuracy, and stability with different sparsity. Our results indicate that although each method has its own pros and cons in different scenarios, Spearman correlation and MIC outperform the others with their overall performances.

HINs are applied in many fields, such as science research, e-commerce, recommendation systems, and bioinformatics. Particularly, HINs have been utilized in biomedical research. Algorithms have been proposed to calculate the correlations between drugs and targets and between diseases and genes. Recently, the interaction between drugs and human genes has become an important subject in the research on drug efficacy and human genomics. In previous studies, numerous prediction methods machine learning and statistical prediction models were proposed to explore this interaction on the biological network. In the current work, we introduce a representation learning method into the biological heterogeneous network and use the representation learning models metapath2vec and metapath2vec++ on our dataset. We combine the adverse drug reaction (ADR) data in the drug{\textendash}gene network with causal relationship between drugs and ADRs. This paper first presents an analysis of the importance of predicting drug{\textendash}gene relationships and discusses the existing prediction methods. Second, the skip-gram model, which is commonly used in representation learning for natural language processing tasks, is explained. Third, the metapath2vec and metapath2vec++ models for the example of drug{\textendash}gene-ADR network are described. Next, the kernelized Bayesian matrix factorization algorithm is used to complete the prediction. Finally, the experimental results of both models are compared with Katz, CATAPULT, and matrix factorization, the prediction visualized by the receiver operating characteristic curves are presented, and the area under the ROC values for three varying algorithm parameters are calculated.},

	abstract = {Human colorectal cancer cell lines are used widely to investigate tumor biology, experimental therapy, and biomarkers. However, to what extent these established cell lines represent and maintain the genetic diversity of primary cancers is uncertain. In this study, we profiled 70 colorectal cancer cell lines for mutations and DNA copy number by whole-exome sequencing and SNP microarray analyses, respectively. Gene expression was defined using RNA-Seq. Cell line data were compared with those published for primary colorectal cancers in The Cancer Genome Atlas. Notably, we found that exome mutation and DNA copy-number spectra in colorectal cancer cell lines closely resembled those seen in primary colorectal tumors. Similarities included the presence of two hypermutation phenotypes, as defined by signatures for defective DNA mismatch repair and DNA polymerase $\varepsilon$ proofreading deficiency, along with concordant mutation profiles in the broadly altered WNT, MAPK, PI3K, TGF$\beta$, and p53 pathways. Furthermore, we documented mutations enriched in genes involved in chromatin remodeling (ARID1A, CHD6, and SRCAP) and histone methylation or acetylation (ASH1L, EP300, EP400, MLL2, MLL3, PRDM2, and TRRAP). Chromosomal instability was prevalent in nonhypermutated cases, with similar patterns of chromosomal gains and losses. Although paired cell lines derived from the same tumor exhibited considerable mutation and DNA copy-number differences, in silico simulations suggest that these differences mainly reflected a preexisting heterogeneity in the tumor cells. In conclusion, our results establish that human colorectal cancer lines are representative of the main subtypes of primary tumors at the genomic level, further validating their utility as tools to investigate colorectal cancer biology and drug responses.

In this work we focus on the identification of microbial signatures, groups of microbial taxa that are predictive of a phenotype of interest. We do this by acknowledging the compositional nature of the microbiome and the fact that it carries relative information. Thus, instead of defining a microbial signature as a linear combination in real space corresponding to the abundances of a group of taxa, we consider microbial signatures given by the geometric means of data from two groups of taxa whose relative abundances, or balance, are associated with the response variable of interest. In this work we present selbal, a greedy stepwise algorithm for selection of balances or microbial signatures that preserves the principles of compositional data analysis. We illustrate the algorithm with 16S rRNA abundance data from a Crohn{\textquoteright}s microbiome study and an HIV microbiome study.

Initial cross-sectional studies provided contradictory associations between microbial richness and HIV serostatus and suggested shifts from Bacteroides to Prevotella predominance following HIV-1 infection, which have not been found in animal models or in studies matched for HIV-1 transmission groups. In two independent cohorts of HIV-1-infected subjects and HIV-1-negative controls in Barcelona (n = 156) and Stockholm (n = 84), men who have sex with men (MSM) predominantly belonged to the Prevotella-rich enterotype whereas most non-MSM subjects were enriched in Bacteroides, independently of HIV-1 status, and with only a limited contribution of diet effects. Moreover, MSM had a significantly richer and more diverse fecal microbiota than non-MSM individuals. After stratifying for sexual orientation, there was no solid evidence of an HIV-specific dysbiosis. However, HIV-1 infection remained consistently associated with reduced bacterial richness, the lowest bacterial richness being observed in subjects with a virological-immune discordant response to antiretroviral therapy. Our findings indicate that HIV gut microbiome studies must control for HIV risk factors and suggest interventions on gut bacterial richness as possible novel avenues to improve HIV-1-associated immune dysfunction.},

An axis defined by an increased abundance in bacteria which include~Enterobacteriaceae, Pasteurellacaea, Veillonellaceae, and Fusobacteriaceae, and decreased abundance in Erysipelotrichales, Bacteroidales, and Clostridiales, correlates strongly with disease status. Microbiome comparison between CD patients with and without antibiotic exposure indicates that antibiotic use amplifies the microbial dysbiosis associated with CD.

Although individuals diagnosed early have a greater than 90~\% chance of survival, more than one-third of individuals do not adhere to screening recommendations partly because the standard diagnostics, colonoscopy and sigmoidoscopy, are expensive and invasive. Thus, there is a great need to improve the sensitivity of non-invasive tests to detect early stage cancers and adenomas. Numerous studies have identified shifts in the composition of the gut microbiota associated with the progression of CRC, suggesting that the gut microbiota may represent a reservoir of biomarkers that would complement existing non-invasive methods such as the widely used fecal immunochemical test (FIT).},

In this work we focused on the diagnosis of inherited metabolic disorders (IMDs) in plasma samples using a targeted metabolomic approach.

The compounds were measured in a multiple reaction monitoring mode. We analyzed 50 control samples and 34 samples with defects in amino acid metabolism (phenylketonuria, maple syrup urine disease, tyrosinemia I, argininemia, homocystinuria, carbamoyl phosphate synthetase deficiency, ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, nonketotic hyperglycinemia), organic acidurias (methylmalonic aciduria, propionic aciduria, glutaric aciduria I, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric aciduria, isovaleric aciduria), and mitochondrial defects (medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency, carnitine palmitoyltransferase II deficiency). The controls were distinguished from the patient samples by principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering. Approximately 80\% of patients were clearly detected by absolute metabolite concentrations, the sum of variance for first two principle components was in the range of 44-55\%. Other patient samples were assigned due to the characteristic ratio of metabolites (the sum of variance for first two principle components 77 and 83\%). This study has revealed that targeted metabolomic tools with automated and unsupervised processing can be applied for the diagnosis of various IMDs.},

The SOM arranges multivariate data based on their similarity to each other by allowing pattern recognition leading to easier interpretation of higher dimensional data. The SOM algorithm allows for selection of different map topologies, distances and parameters, which determine how the data will be organized on the map. In the particular case of compositional data (such as elemental, mineralogical, or maceral abundance), the sample space is governed by Aitchison geometry and extra steps are required prior to their SOM analysis. Following the principle of working on log-ratio coordinates, the simplicial operations and the Aitchison distance, which are appropriate elements for the SOM, are presented. With this structure developed, a SOM using Aitchison geometry is applied to properly interpret elemental data from combustion products (bottom ash, fly ash, and economizer fly ash) in a Wyoming coal-fired power plant. Results from this effort provide knowledge about the differences between the ash composition in the coal combustion process.},

However, these aims are often complicated by difficulties stemming from high-dimensionality, non-normality, sparsity, and the compositional nature of microbiome data sets. A key tool in microbiome analysis is beta diversity, defined by the distances between microbial samples. Many different distance metrics have been proposed, all with varying discriminatory power on data with differing characteristics. Here, we propose a compositional beta diversity metric rooted in a centered log-ratio transformation and matrix completion called robust Aitchison PCA. We demonstrate the benefits of compositional transformations upstream of beta diversity calculations through simulations. Additionally, we demonstrate improved effect size, classification accuracy, and robustness to sequencing depth over the current methods on several decreased sample subsets of real microbiome data sets. Finally, we highlight the ability of this new beta diversity metric to retain the feature loadings linked to sample ordinations revealing salient intercommunity niche feature importance.
IMPORTANCE By accounting for the sparse compositional nature of microbiome data sets, robust Aitchison PCA can yield high discriminatory power and salient feature ranking between microbial niches.

For apparently historical reasons, the common approach is either to use simple proportions (which does not address heteroscedasticity) or to use rarefying of counts, even though both of these approaches are inappropriate for detection of differentially abundant species. Well-established statistical theory is available that simultaneously accounts for library size differences and biological variability using an appropriate mixture model. Moreover, specific implementations for DNA sequencing read count data (based on a Negative Binomial model for instance) are already available in RNA-Seq focused R packages such as edgeR and DESeq. Here we summarize the supporting statistical theory and use simulations and empirical data to demonstrate substantial improvements provided by a relevant mixture model framework over simple proportions or rarefying. We show how both proportions and rarefied counts result in a high rate of false positives in tests for species that are differentially abundant across sample classes. Regarding microbiome sample-wise clustering, we also show that the rarefying procedure often discards samples that can be accurately clustered by alternative methods. We further compare different Negative Binomial methods with a recently-described zero-inflated Gaussian mixture, implemented in a package called metagenomeSeq. We find that metagenomeSeq performs well when there is an adequate number of biological replicates, but it nevertheless tends toward a higher false positive rate. Based on these results and well-established statistical theory, we advocate that investigators avoid rarefying altogether. We have provided microbiome-specific extensions to these tools in the R package, phyloseq.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have suggested that the gut microbiome may be an important factor in the development of colorectal cancer. Abnormalities in the gut microbiome have been reported in patients with colorectal cancer; however, this microbial community has not been explored as a potential screen for early-stage disease. We characterized the gut microbiome in patients from three clinical groups representing the stages of colorectal cancer development: healthy, adenoma, and carcinoma. Analysis of the gut microbiome from stool samples revealed both an enrichment and depletion of several bacterial populations associated with adenomas and carcinomas. Combined with known clinical risk factors of colorectal cancer (e.g., BMI, age, race), data from the gut microbiome significantly improved the ability to differentiate between healthy, adenoma, and carcinoma clinical groups relative to risk factors alone. Using Bayesian methods, we determined that using gut microbiome data as a screening tool improved the pretest to posttest probability of adenoma more than 50-fold. For example, the pretest probability in a 65-year-old was 0.17\% and, after using the microbiome data, this increased to 10.67\% (1 in 9 chance of having an adenoma). Taken together, the results of our study demonstrate the feasibility of using the composition of the gut microbiome to detect the presence of precancerous and cancerous lesions. Furthermore, these results support the need for more cross-sectional studies with diverse populations and linkage to other stool markers, dietary data, and personal health information.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the potential for diagnosing colorectal cancer (CRC) from faecal metagenomes.
DESIGN: We performed metagenome-wide association studies on faecal samples from 74 patients with CRC and 54 controls from China, and validated the results in 16 patients and 24 controls from Denmark. We further validated the biomarkers in two published cohorts from France and Austria. Finally, we employed targeted quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays to evaluate diagnostic potential of selected biomarkers in an independent Chinese cohort of 47 patients and 109 controls.
RESULTS: Besides confirming known associations of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Peptostreptococcus stomatis with CRC, we found significant associations with several species, including Parvimonas micra and Solobacterium moorei. We identified 20 microbial gene markers that differentiated CRC and control microbiomes, and validated 4 markers in the Danish cohort. In the French and Austrian cohorts, these four genes distinguished CRC metagenomes from controls with areas under the receiver-operating curve (AUC) of 0.72 and 0.77, respectively. qPCR measurements of two of these genes accurately classified patients with CRC in the independent Chinese cohort with AUC=0.84 and OR of 23. These genes were enriched in early-stage (I-II) patient microbiomes, highlighting the potential for using faecal metagenomic biomarkers for early diagnosis of CRC.
CONCLUSIONS: We present the first metagenomic profiling study of CRC faecal microbiomes to discover and validate microbial biomarkers in ethnically different cohorts, and to independently validate selected biomarkers using an affordable clinically relevant technology. Our study thus takes a step further towards affordable non-invasive early diagnostic biomarkers for CRC from faecal samples.},

We identified a set of 40 features (p~{\textless} 0.006), which included 37 bacterial species that were used to construct a Random Forest classifier model to distinguish mild/moderate NAFLD from advanced fibrosis.

Initial cross-sectional studies provided contradictory associations between microbial richness and HIV serostatus and suggested shifts from Bacteroides to Prevotella predominance following HIV-1 infection, which have not been found in animal models or in studies matched for HIV-1 transmission groups. In two independent cohorts of HIV-1-infected subjects and HIV-1-negative controls in Barcelona (n~=~156) and Stockholm (n~=~84), men who have sex with men (MSM) predominantly belonged to the Prevotella-rich enterotype whereas most non-MSM subjects were enriched in Bacteroides, independently of HIV-1 status, and with only a limited contribution of diet effects. Moreover, MSM had a significantly richer and more diverse fecal microbiota than non-MSM individuals. After stratifying for sexual orientation, there was no solid evidence of an HIV-specific dysbiosis. However, HIV-1 infection remained consistently associated with reduced bacterial richness, the lowest bacterial richness being observed in subjects with a virological-immune discordant response to antiretroviral therapy. Our findings indicate that HIV gut microbiome studies must control for HIV risk factors and suggest interventions on gut bacterial richness as possible novel avenues to improve HIV-1-associated immune dysfunction.,

        , The human intestinal microbiota is essential for human health and well-being and is driven by genetic, lifestyle and environmental factors. Here, we show in two independent cohorts of HIV-1-infected subjects and HIV-1-negative controls in Europe that gay men often have a distinct composition of the human fecal microbiota, with increased microbial richness and diversity and enrichment in the Prevotella enterotype. This is independent of HIV-1 status, and with only a limited contribution of diet effects. After accounting for sexual orientation, however, HIV-1 infection remains associated to reduced bacterial richness, more so in subjects with suboptimal CD4~+ T-cell count recovery under antiretroviral therapy. Future studies should evaluate if interventions to increase gut bacterial richness could improve HIV-associated immune dysfunction.},

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and subsequent meta-analyses of CD and UC, as separate phenotypes implicated previously unsuspected mechanisms, such as autophagy, in pathogenesis and showed that some IBD loci are shared with other inflammatory diseases. Here we expand knowledge of relevant pathways by undertaking a meta-analysis of CD and UC genome-wide association scans, with validation of significant findings in more than 75,000 cases and controls. We identify 71 new associations, for a total of 163 IBD loci that meet genome-wide significance thresholds. Most loci contribute to both phenotypes, and both directional and balancing selection effects are evident. Many IBD loci are also implicated in other immune-mediated disorders, most notably with ankylosing spondylitis and psoriasis. We also observe striking overlap between susceptibility loci for IBD and mycobacterial infection. Gene co-expression network analysis emphasizes this relationship, with pathways shared between host responses to mycobacteria and those predisposing to IBD.},

	abstract = {OPINION STATEMENT: Despite recent major strides in our understanding of the genetic and microbial influences that contribute to the development of the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), their etiology continues to be enigmatic. Results from experiments in animal models of IBDs overwhelmingly support a causal role of the microbiota in these diseases, though whether such a cause-effect relationship exists in human IBDs is still uncertain. Therefore, virtually all currently approved and most often prescribed treatments for IBDs are directed toward the over-active immune response in these diseases rather than the intestinal bacteria. Nevertheless, there is an important need for non-immunosuppressive therapies that may present a more favorable risk-benefit profile such as those that selectively target the disruptions in gut microbiota that accompany IBDs. This need has led to clinical trials of various microbial-directed therapies including fecal microbial transplant, antibiotics, probiotics, and prebiotics. Unfortunately, these published studies, many of which are small, have generally failed to demonstrate a consistent benefit of these agents in IBDs, thus leading to slow acceptance of microbe-focused treatments for these conditions. In this article, we review and summarize the microbial basis for IBDs and the results of the most recent trials of fecal microbial transplant, antibiotics, probiotics, and prebiotics in IBDs. We also comment on possible safety concerns with these agents, speculate on why they have failed to show efficacy in certain clinical settings, and propose strategies to improve their usefulness.},

To assess the perturbations of gene expression in trisomy 21, and to eliminate the noise of genomic variability, we studied the transcriptome of fetal fibroblasts from a pair of monozygotic twins discordant for trisomy 21. Here we show that the differential expression between the twins is organized in domains along all chromosomes that are either upregulated or downregulated. These gene expression dysregulation domains (GEDDs) can be defined by the expression level of their gene content, and are well conserved in induced pluripotent stem cells derived from the twins{\textquoteright} fibroblasts. Comparison of the transcriptome of the Ts65Dn mouse model of Down{\textquoteright}s syndrome and normal littermate mouse fibroblasts also showed GEDDs along the mouse chromosomes that were syntenic in human. The GEDDs correlate with the lamina-associated (LADs) and replication domains of mammalian cells. The overall position of LADs was not altered in trisomic cells; however, the H3K4me3 profile of the trisomic fibroblasts was modified and accurately followed the GEDD pattern. These results indicate that the nuclear compartments of trisomic cells undergo modifications of the chromatin environment influencing the overall transcriptome, and that GEDDs may therefore contribute to some trisomy 21 phenotypes.},

Down syndrome (DS, trisomy 21) is associated with developmental abnormalities and increased leukemia risk. To reconcile chromatin alterations with transcriptome changes, we performed paired exogenous spike-in normalized RNA and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing in DS models. Absolute normalization unmasks global amplification of gene expression associated with trisomy 21. Overexpression of the nucleosome binding protein HMGN1 (encoded on chr21q22) recapitulates transcriptional changes seen with triplication of a Down syndrome critical region on distal~chromosome 21, and HMGN1 is necessary for B cell phenotypes in DS models. Absolute exogenous-normalized chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Rx) also reveals a global increase in histone H3K27 acetylation caused by HMGN1. Transcriptional amplification downstream of HMGN1 is enriched for stage-specific programs of B cells and B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, dependent on the developmental cellular context. These data offer a mechanistic explanation for DS transcriptional patterns and suggest that further study of HMGN1 and RNA amplification in diverse DS phenotypes is warranted.},

Single-cell sequencing can illuminate the genetic properties of brain cancers and reveal heterogeneity within a tumor. Patel et al. examined the genome sequence of single cells isolated from brain glioblastomas. The findings revealed shared chromosomal changes but also extensive transcription variation, including genes related to signaling, which represent potential therapeutic targets. The authors suggest that the variation in tumor cells reflects neural development and that such variation among cancer cells may prove to have clinical significance.
Science, this issue p. 1396
Human cancers are complex ecosystems composed of cells with distinct phenotypes, genotypes, and epigenetic states, but current models do not adequately reflect tumor composition in patients. We used single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to profile 430 cells from five primary glioblastomas, which we found to be inherently variable in their expression of diverse transcriptional programs related to oncogenic signaling, proliferation, complement/immune response, and hypoxia. We also observed a continuum of stemness-related expression states that enabled us to identify putative regulators of stemness in vivo. Finally, we show that established glioblastoma subtype classifiers are variably expressed across individual cells within a tumor and demonstrate the potential prognostic implications of such intratumoral heterogeneity. Thus, we reveal previously unappreciated heterogeneity in diverse regulatory programs central to glioblastoma biology, prognosis, and therapy.
Screening individual cancer cells within a brain tumor may help to guide treatment and predict prognosis.

Our analyses suggested that: (a) on a transcriptome level, whole blood shares significant gene expression similarities with multiple CNS tissues; (b) the median non-parametric correlation between transcripts present in both whole blood and CNS was around 0.5; (c) this correlation of 0.5 was intermediate relative to all tissues in the Novartis data set{\textemdash}less than for the maximum achievable value of 0.85, less than a set of immune tissues (0.64), comparable to a heterogeneous set of somatic tissues (0.57) but greater than muscle (0.48) and peripheral nervous system tissues (0.36); (d) about half of a set of candidate genes relevant to schizophrenia were expressed in both whole blood and prefrontal cortex; and (e) the expression levels of many classes of biologically relevant processes were not significantly different between whole blood and prefrontal cortex. These analyses suggest that gene expression in whole blood is neither perfectly correlated and useful nor perfectly uncorrelated and useless with gene expression in multiple brain tissues.

Upregulation of genes within this process can be indicative of a more aggressive phenotype and linked with worse outcome. In the present article we identify DNA damage related genes associated with worse outcome in breast cancer.
RESULTS: 2286 genes were differentially expressed between normal breast tissue and basal-like tumors, and 62 included in the DNA metabolic process function. Expression of RAD51, GINS1, TRIP13 and MCM2 were associated with detrimental relapse free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) in luminal tumors. The combined analyses of TRIP13+RAD51+MCM2 showed the worse association for RFS (HR 2.25 (1.51-3.35) log rank p= 4.1e-05) and TRIP13+RAD51 for OS (HR 5.13 (0.6-44.17) log rank p=0.098) in ER+/HER2- tumors. TRIP13 is amplified in 3.1\% of breast cancers.
METHODS: Transcriptomic analyses using public datasets evaluating expression values between normal breast tissue and TNBC identified upregulated genes. Genes included in the DNA metabolic process were selected and confirmed using data contained at oncomine (www.oncomine.org). Evaluation of the selected genes with RFS and OS was performed using the KM Plotter Online Tool (http://www.kmplot.com). Evaluation of molecular alterations was performed using cBioportal (www.cbioportal.org).
CONCLUSIONS: Expression of DNA metabolic related genes RAD51, GINS1, TRIP13 and MCM2 are associated with poor outcome. Combinations of some of these genes are linked to poor RFS or OS in luminal A, B and ER+HER2- tumors. Evaluation of its predictive capacity in prospective studies is required.},

Inherited variants (copy number variants and single nucleotide polymorphisms) and acquired somatic copy number aberrations (CNAs) were associated with expression in \~{}40\% of genes, with the landscape dominated by cis- and trans-acting CNAs.

	abstract = {Background
Control of DNA damage is frequently deregulated in solid tumors. Upregulation of genes within this process can be indicative of a more aggressive phenotype and linked with worse outcome. In the present article we identify DNA damage related genes associated with worse outcome in breast cancer.

Results
2286 genes were differentially expressed between normal breast tissue and basal-like tumors, and 62 included in the DNA metabolic process function. Expression of RAD51, GINS1, TRIP13 and MCM2 were associated with detrimental relapse free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) in luminal tumors. The combined analyses of TRIP13+RAD51+MCM2 showed the worse association for RFS (HR 2.25 (1.51-3.35) log rank p= 4.1e-05) and TRIP13+RAD51 for OS (HR 5.13 (0.6-44.17) log rank p=0.098) in ER+/HER2- tumors. TRIP13 is amplified in 3.1\% of breast cancers.

Methods
Transcriptomic analyses using public datasets evaluating expression values between normal breast tissue and TNBC identified upregulated genes. Genes included in the DNA metabolic process were selected and confirmed using data contained at oncomine (www.oncomine.org). Evaluation of the selected genes with RFS and OS was performed using the KM Plotter Online Tool (http://www.kmplot.com).

Conclusions
Expression of DNA metabolic related genes RAD51, GINS1, TRIP13 and MCM2 are associated with poor outcome. Combinations of some of these genes are linked to poor RFS or OS in luminal A, B and ER+HER2- tumors. Evaluation of its predictive capacity in prospective studies is required.},

	abstract = {BackgroundBreast cancer is a heterogeneous disease comprising several biologically different types, exhibiting diverse responses to treatment. In the past years, gene expression profiling has led to definition of several {\textquotedblleft}intrinsic subtypes{\textquotedblright} of breast cancer (basal-like, HER2-enriched, luminal-A, luminal-B and normal-like), and microarray based predictors such as PAM50 have been developed. Despite their advantage over traditional histopathological classification, precise identification of breast cancer subtypes, especially within the largest and highly variable luminal-A class, remains a challenge. In this study, we revisited the molecular classification of breast tumors using both expression and methylation data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).MethodsUnsupervised clustering was applied on 1148 and 679 breast cancer samples using RNA-Seq and DNA methylation data, respectively. Clusters were evaluated using clinical information and by comparison to PAM50 subtypes. Differentially expressed genes and differentially methylated CpGs were tested for enrichment using various annotation sets. Survival analysis was conducted on the identified clusters using the log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards model.ResultsThe clusters in both expression and methylation datasets had only moderate agreement with PAM50 calls, while our partitioning of the luminal samples had better five-year prognostic value than the luminal-A/luminal-B assignment as called by PAM50. Our analysis partitioned the expression profiles of the luminal-A samples into two biologically distinct subgroups exhibiting differential expression of immune-related genes, with one subgroup carrying significantly higher risk for five-year recurrence. Analysis of the luminal-A samples using methylation data identified a cluster of patients with poorer survival, characterized by distinct hyper-methylation of developmental genes. Cox multivariate survival analysis confirmed the prognostic significance of the two partitions after adjustment for commonly used factors such as age and pathological stage.ConclusionsModern genomic datasets reveal large heterogeneity among luminal breast tumors. Our analysis of these data provides two prognostic gene sets that dissect and explain tumor variability within the luminal-A subgroup, thus, contributing to the advancement of subtype-specific diagnosis and treatment.},

High CES values correlate with increased levels of genomic instability and several specific adverse tumour properties, and prognosticate poor patient survival for breast and lung cancers, especially early-stage tumours. They also signify high levels of genomic instability that sensitize cancer cells to additional genotoxicity. Thus, the CES signature forecasts patient response to adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND
The St. Gallen International Expert Consensus of 2011 proposes a new classification system for breast cancer based on its division into five subgroups. The criteria to identify these subtypes were recently refined at the 2013 Conference. In this respect, the authors of this paper have conducted a retrospective analysis of breast cancer subtypes, related to Ki-67 and involvement of the axillary lymph nodes (ALNs). The analysis was performed only in the cases of invasive breast cancer in the pT2 stages. The research and results of the paper have shown that investigating the value of these parameters could be of great benefit in future treatment strategies of invasive breast cancer.

METHODS
A retrospective analysis of breast cancer subtypes, tumor nodal metastatic staging, and histopathological grading of 108 cases has been performed according to the methods recommended and provided by the St. Gallen International Expert Consensus Report, 2011. The estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), and Ki-67 of 108 tumor samples were all investigated by immunohistochemistry according to the methods used to classify breast cancer subtypes as proposed in the St. Gallen Consensus Report, 2011. Invasive breast cancers (n = 108) were immunohistochemically classified as follows: 28 (25.92\%) as Luminal A, 51 (47.22\%) as Luminal B (HER2 negative), 21 (19.44\%) as Luminal B-like (HER2 negative), 2 (1.85\%) as HER2 positive, and 6 (5.55\%) as being a triple-negative subtype.

RESULTS
The conclusion was made that when Ki-67 was found to be higher, patients also showed a higher involvement in their ALNs. The chi-square test shows the difference to be significant (chi-square = 4.757; P = 0.029). Luminal B subtypes had the highest percentage (54.9\%) of involvement of lymph nodes when compared to the other four subtypes. The Luminal B subtype had a higher percentage (51.4\%) of involvement of lymph nodes than did Luminal A (10.7\%). The chi-square test also shows the difference to be significant (P {\textless} 0.05).

CONCLUSION
A combination of the Ki-67 index, HER negative tumors, PR negativity, and a low value that can be used to segregate ER positive pT2 tumors into prognostically significantly different clinical outcomes may be utilized clinically to guide patient management in accordance with these tumor characteristics.},

This review explores and summarizes the existing intrinsic subtypes, patient clinical features and management, commercial signature panels, as well as various information used for tumor classification.

	abstract = {The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), which include Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are multifactorial chronic conditions of the gastrointestinal tract. While IBD has been associated with dramatic changes in the gut microbiota, changes in the gut metabolome-the molecular interface between host and microbiota-are less well understood. To address this gap, we performed untargeted metabolomic and shotgun metagenomic profiling of cross-sectional stool samples from discovery (n = 155) and validation (n = 65) cohorts of CD, UC and non-IBD control patients. Metabolomic and metagenomic profiles were broadly correlated with faecal calprotectin levels (a measure of gut inflammation). Across {\textgreater}8,000 measured metabolite features, we identified chemicals and chemical classes that were differentially abundant in IBD, including enrichments for sphingolipids and bile acids, and depletions for triacylglycerols and tetrapyrroles. While {\textgreater} 50\% of differentially abundant metabolite features were uncharacterized, many could be assigned putative roles through metabolomic 'guilt by association' (covariation with known metabolites). Differentially abundant species and functions from the metagenomic profiles reflected adaptation to oxidative stress in the IBD gut, and were individually consistent with previous findings. Integrating these data, however, we identified 122 robust associations between differentially abundant species and well-characterized differentially abundant metabolites, indicating possible mechanistic relationships that are perturbed in IBD. Finally, we found that metabolome- and metagenome-based classifiers of IBD status were highly accurate and, like the vast majority of individual trends, generalized well to the independent validation cohort. Our findings thus provide an improved understanding of perturbations of the microbiome-metabolome interface in IBD, including identification of many potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets.},

These trans-eQTL signals confirmed and extended the previously reported KLF14-mediated network to 55 target genes, validated the CIITA regulation of class II MHC genes, and identified ZNF800 as a candidate master regulator. Finally, we observed similar expression-clinical trait correlations of genes associated with GWAS loci in both humans and a panel of genetically diverse mice.

Yet such sequence count data is often extremely sparse; that is, much of the data is zero values. Such zero values are well known to cause problems for statistical analyses. In this work we provide a systematic description of different processes that can give rise to zero values as well as the types of methods for addressing zeros in sequence count studies. Importantly, we systematically review how various models perform on each type of zero generating process. Our results demonstrate that zero-inflated models can have substantial biases in both simulated and real data settings. Additionally, we find that zeros due to biological absences can, for many applications, be approximated as originating from under sampling. Beyond these results, this work provides a paired categorization scheme for models and zero generating processes to facilitate discussions and future research into the analysis of sequence count data.},

	abstract = {Motivation: In single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) experiments, RNA transcripts are extracted and measured from isolated cells to understand gene expression at the cellular level. Measurements from this technology are affected by many technical artifacts, including batch effects. In analogous bulk gene expression experiments, external references, e.g., synthetic gene spike-ins often from the External RNA Controls Consortium (ERCC), may be incorpo- rated to the experimental protocol for use in adjusting measurements for technical artifacts. In scRNA-seq experiments, the use of external spike-ins is controversial due to dissimilarities with endogenous genes and uncertainty about sufficient precision of their introduction. Instead, endogenous genes with highly stable expression could be used as references within scRNA-seq to help normalize the data. First, however, a specific notion of stable expression at the single cell level needs to be formulated; genes could be stable in absolute expression, in proportion to cell volume, or in proportion to total gene expression. Different types of stable genes will be useful for different normalizations and will need different methods for discovery. Results: We compile gene sets whose products are associated with cellular structures and record these gene sets for future reuse and analysis. We find that genes whose final product are associated with the cytosolic ribosome have expressions that are highly stable with respect to the total RNA content. Notably, these genes appear to be stable in bulk measurements as well. Supplementary information: The Supplement is available on bioRxiv, and the gene set database is available through GitHub.},

	abstract = {Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) are one of the main cell populations that negatively regulate immune responses. However, the mechanism underlying the expansion of MDSC remains unclear. Using miRNA microarray and TaqMan probe-based quantitative RT-PCR assay, we identified microRNA (miR)-155 and miR-21 as the two most upregulated miRNAs during the induction of MDSC from the bone marrow cells by GM-CSF and IL-6. High levels of miR-155 and miR-21 also were detected in bone marrow and spleen MDSC isolated from tumor-bearing mice. Our results also showed that TGF-$\beta$ promoted the induction of MDSC through upregulating miR-155 and miR-21 expression. Overexpression of miR-155 and miR-21 enhanced whereas depletion of miR-155 and miR-21 reduced the frequencies of cytokine-induced MDSC. Subpopulation analysis indicated that miR-21 and miR-155 induced the expansion of both monocytic and granulocytic MDSC. Furthermore, miR-155 and miR-21 showed a synergistic effect on MDSC induction via targeting SHIP-1 and phosphatase and tensin homolog, respectively, leading to STAT3 activation. Finally, dexamethasone treatment strongly enhanced MDSC expansion through upregulating miR-155 and miR-21 expression, and the effect of dexamethasone on MDSC induction was abolished by depleting cellular miR-155 and miR-21. These results demonstrate a novel miR-155/miR-21-based regulatory mechanism that modulates functional MDSC induction.},

Here, we address the question of what can be done when it is relatively easy to obtain healthy patient samples, but when abnormalities corresponding to disease states may be rare and one-of-a-kind. The associated computational challenge, anomaly detection, is a well-studied machine-learning problem. However, due to the dimensionality and variability of expression data, existing methods based on feature space analysis or individual anomalously expressed genes are insufficient. We present a novel approach, CSAX, that identifies pathways in an individual sample in which the normal expression relationships are disrupted. To evaluate our approach, we have compiled and released a compendium of public expression data sets, reformulated to create a test bed for anomaly detection. We demonstrate the accuracy of CSAX on the data sets in our compendium, compare it to other leading methods, and show that CSAX aids in both identifying anomalies and explaining their underlying biology. We describe an approach to characterizing the difficulty of specific expression anomaly detection tasks. We then illustrate CSAX's value in two developmental case studies. Confirming prior hypotheses, CSAX highlights disruption of platelet activation pathways in a neonate with retinopathy of prematurity and identifies, for the first time, dysregulated oxidative stress response in second trimester amniotic fluid of fetuses with obese mothers. Our approach provides an important step toward identification of individual disease patterns in the era of precision medicine.},

	abstract = {BackgroundGastric cancer (GC) is a deadly malignancy worldwide. In the past, it has been shown that cellular signaling pathway alterations play a crucial role in the development of GC. In particular, deregulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway seems to affect multiple GC functions including growth, proliferation, metabolism, motility and angiogenesis. Targeting alterations in this pathway by microRNAs (miRNAs) represents a potential therapeutic strategy, especially in inhibitor-resistant tumors. The objective of this study was to evaluate the expression of 3 pre-selected miRNAs, miR-101-2, miR-125b-2 and miR-451a, in a series of primary GC tissues and matched non-GC tissues and in several GC-derived cell lines, and to subsequently evaluate the functional role of these miRNAs.MethodsTwenty-five primary GC samples, 25 matched non-GC samples and 3 GC-derived cell lines, i.e., AGS, MKN28 and MKN45, were included in this study. miRNA and target gene expression levels were assessed by quantitative RT-PCR and western blotting, respectively. Subsequently, cell viability, clone formation, cell death, migration and invasion assays were performed on AGS cells.ResultsmiR-101-2, miR-125b-2 and miR-451a were found to be down-regulated in the primary GC tissues and the GC-derived cell lines tested. MiRNA mimic transfections significantly reduced cell viability and colony formation, increased cell death and reduced cell migration and invasion in AGS cells. We also found that exogenous expression of miR-101-2, miR-125b-2 and miR-451a decreased the expression of their putative targets MTOR, PIK3CB and TSC1, respectively.ConclusionsOur expression analyses and in vitro functional assays suggest that miR-101-2, miR-125b-2 and miR-451a act as potential tumor suppressors in primary GCs as well as in GC-derived AGS cells.},

Here, we reported that miR-423-3p overexpressed in primary laryngeal carcinoma cell line where it plays a critical role in tumor progression. Suppression of miR-423-3p expression resulted in decreasing cell proliferation, clonogenicity, cell migration and invasion. By using in silico prediction algorithms for target identification, AdipoR2 (adiponectin receptor 2) and DUSP4 (MAP kinase phosphatase 2) were identified to be potential targets of miR-423-3p. Overexpression of miR-423-3p was associated with epigenetic silencing of AdipoR2 in human laryngeal carcinoma samples, which have been previously implicated in suppression of tumor proliferation and angiogenesis. Luciferase reporter assays and western blot further confirmed the direct interaction of miR-423-3p with AdipoR2. Our findings have demonstrated that miR-423-3p plays an important oncogenic role in laryngeal carcinoma progression, and further suggest that suppression of miR-423-3p expression might be useful for its clinical management.},

	abstract = {The metastasis of gastric cancer, one of the most common tumors, has a molecular mechanism that is still largely unclear. Here we investigated the role of possible tumor-suppressor miR-1296-5p in the cell migration and invasion of ERBB2-positive gastric cancer. It found that miR-1296-5p was significantly down-regulated in gastric cancer tissues. Moreover, it was down-regulated in lymph node metastatic gastric cancer tissues compared with non-metastatic gastric cancer tissues. The luciferase activity of ERBB2 3'-untranslated region-based reporters constructed in SNU-216 and NUGC-4 gastric cancer cells suggested that ERBB2 was the target gene of miR-1296-5p. Overexpressed miR-1296-5p reduced its target protein level and Rac1 activation, and inhibited the migration and invasion of SNU-216 and NUGC-4 gastric cancer cells. MiR-1296-5p was down-regulated in ERBB2-positive gastric cancer tissues compared with ERBB2-negative gastric cancer tissues. In ERBB2-positive gastric cancers, the miR-1296-5p expression was suppressed in a majority of metastatic lymph node tissues compared to non-metastatic gastric cancer samples. The migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells was inhibited by miR-1296-5p overexpression or herceptin treatment, and rescued by the overexpression of constitutively active Rac1-Q61L or ERBB2. Taken together, our findings first suggest that miR-1296-5p might be involved in the regulation on the migration and invasion of human gastric cancer cells at least in part via targeting ERBB2/Rac1 signaling pathway.},

Chemotherapy or hormonal therapy reduces the risk of distant metastases by approximately one-third; however, 70-80\% of patients receiving this treatment would have survived without it. None of the signatures of breast cancer gene expression reported to date allow for patient-tailored therapy strategies. Here we used DNA microarray analysis on primary breast tumours of 117 young patients, and applied supervised classification to identify a gene expression signature strongly predictive of a short interval to distant metastases ('poor prognosis' signature) in patients without tumour cells in local lymph nodes at diagnosis (lymph node negative). In addition, we established a signature that identifies tumours of BRCA1 carriers. The poor prognosis signature consists of genes regulating cell cycle, invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis. This gene expression profile will outperform all currently used clinical parameters in predicting disease outcome.

	abstract = {Prostate cancer is a major health problem worldwide due to its high incidence morbidity and mortality. There is currently a need of improved biomarkers, capable to distinguish mild versus aggressive forms of the disease, and thus guide therapeutic decisions. Although miRNAs deregulated in cancer represent exciting candidates as biomarkers, its scientific literature is frequently fragmented in dispersed studies. This problem is aggravated for miRNAs belonging to miRNA gene clusters with shared target genes. The miRNA cluster composed by hsa-mir-130b and hsa-mir-301b precursors was recently involved in prostate cancer pathogenesis, yet different studies assigned it opposite effects on the disease. We sought to elucidate the role of the human miR-130b/301b miRNA cluster in prostate cancer through a comprehensive data analysis of most published clinical cohorts. We interrogated methylomes, transcriptomes and patient clinical data, unifying previous reports and adding original analysis using the largest available cohort (TCGA-PRAD). We found that hsa-miR-130b-3p and hsa-miR-301b-3p are upregulated in neoplastic vs normal prostate tissue, as well as in metastatic vs primary sites. However, this increase in expression is not due to a decrease of the global DNA methylation of the genes in prostate tissues, as the promoter of the gene remains lowly methylated in normal and neoplastic tissue. A comparison of the levels of human miR-130b/301b and all the clinical variables reported for the major available cohorts, yielded positive correlations with malignance, specifically significant for T-stage, residual tumor status and primary therapy outcome. The assessment of the correlations between the hsa-miR-130b-3p and hsa-miR-301b-3p and candidate target genes in clinical samples, supports their repression of tumor suppressor genes in prostate cancer. Altogether, these results favor an oncogenic role of miR-130b/301b cluster in prostate cancer.},

An effort is underway to explore and investigate multiple reliable prognostic markers to improve management of BRCA patients and provide novel therapeutic targets. The aim of the study is to identify the prognostic miRNA signature in BRCA patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The miRNA-sequencing data and clinical information of BRCA patients were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database.
RESULTS: A total of 106 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified between BRCA tissues and matched normal tissues, including 81 up-regulated miRNAs and 25 down-regulated miRNAs. Then, we established a set of three-miRNA signature that was significantly associated with BRCA patients' survival. Using the prognostic three-miRNA signature, we classified the BRCA patients into high-risk and low-risk groups. Multivariate Cox regression demonstrated that the prognostic power of the three-miRNA signature was independent of other clinical variables. Functional enrichment analysis suggested that three prognostic miRNAs may be involved in known BRCA-related KEGG pathways and biological processes.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that three-miRNA signature could be a potential biomarker for predicting clinical outcomes for BRCA patients.},

	abstract = {Background
Microbial communities (microbiota) influence human and animal disease and immunity, geochemical nutrient cycling and plant productivity. Specific groups, including bacteria, archaea, eukaryotes or fungi, are amplified by PCR to assess the relative abundance of sub-groups (e.g. genera). However, neither the absolute abundance of sub-groups is revealed, nor can different amplicon families (i.e. OTUs derived from a specific pair of PCR primers such as bacterial 16S, eukaryotic 18S or fungi ITS) be compared. This prevents determination of the absolute abundance of a particular group and domain-level shifts in microbiota abundance can remain undetected.

Results
We have developed absolute quantitation of amplicon families using synthetic chimeric DNA spikes. Synthetic spikes were added directly to environmental samples, co-isolated and PCR-amplified, allowing calculation of the absolute abundance of amplicon families (e.g. prokaryotic 16S, eukaryotic 18S and fungal ITS per unit mass of sample).

Conclusions
Spikes can be adapted to any amplicon-specific group including rhizobia from soils, Firmicutes and Bifidobacteria from human gut or Enterobacteriaceae from food samples. Crucially, using highly complex soil samples, we show that the absolute abundance of specific groups can remain steady or increase, even when their relative abundance decreases. Thus, without absolute quantitation, the underlying pathology, physiology and ecology of microbial groups may be masked by their relative abundance.

After UV irradiation, the tissue is solubilized and the RNA partially digested, allowing a small fragment to remain attached to protein. RNA-protein complexes of interest are partially purified by immunoprecipitation and noncovalently associated RNA removed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). These purified RNA-protein complexes are isolated and treated with proteinase K, which removes protein but leaves intact RNA.

	abstract = {The modulation of DNA-protein interactions by methylation of protein-binding sites in DNA and the occurrence in genomic imprinting, X chromosome inactivation, and fragile X syndrome of different methylation patterns in DNA of different chromosomal origin have underlined the need to establish methylation patterns in individual strands of particular genomic sequences. We report a genomic sequencing method that provides positive identification of 5-methylcytosine residues and yields strand-specific sequences of individual molecules in genomic DNA. The method utilizes bisulfite-induced modification of genomic DNA, under conditions whereby cytosine is converted to uracil, but 5-methylcytosine remains nonreactive. The sequence under investigation is then amplified by PCR with two sets of strand-specific primers to yield a pair of fragments, one from each strand, in which all uracil and thymine residues have been amplified as thymine and only 5-methylcytosine residues have been amplified as cytosine. The PCR products can be sequenced directly to provide a strand-specific average sequence for the population of molecules or can be cloned and sequenced to provide methylation maps of single DNA molecules. We tested the method by defining the methylation status within single DNA strands of two closely spaced CpG dinucleotides in the promoter of the human kininogen gene. During the analysis, we encountered in sperm DNA an unusual methylation pattern, which suggests that the high methylation level of single-copy sequences in sperm may be locally modulated by binding of protein factors in germ-line cells.},

In cultured microbes, the genomic data come from a single clone, making sequence assembly and annotation tractable. In metagenomics, the data come from heterogeneous microbial communities, sometimes containing more than 10,000 species, with the sequence data being noisy and partial.

Metagenomics produces a taxonomical profile of the sample, metatranscriptomics helps us to obtain a functional profile, and metabolomics completes the picture by determining which byproducts are being released into the environment. Although each approach provides valuable information separately, we show that, when combined, they paint a more comprehensive picture.

The first decade of microbiome research was mainly characterized by usage of DNA sequencing-based 16S rDNA and shotgun metagenome sequencing, allowing for the elucidation of microbial composition and genome structure. Technological advances in RNA-seq have recently provided us with an ability to gain insight into the genes that are actively expressed in complex bacterial communities, enabling the elucidation of the functional changes that dictate the microbiome functions at given contexts, its interactions with the host, and functional alterations that accompany the conversion of a healthy microbiome toward a disease-driving configuration. Here, we highlight some of the key metatranscriptomics strategies that are implemented to determine microbiota gene expression and its regulation and discuss the advantages and potential challenges associated with these approaches.},

	abstract = {Background Differential expression analysis on the basis of RNA-Seq count data has become a standard tool in transcriptomics. Several studies have shown that prior normalization of the data is crucial for a reliable detection of transcriptional differences. Until now it has not been clear whether and how the transcriptomic approach can be used for differential expression analysis in metatranscriptomics. Methods We propose a model for differential expression in metatranscriptomics that explicitly accounts for variations in the taxonomic composition of transcripts across different samples. As a main consequence the correct normalization of metatranscriptomic count data under this model requires the taxonomic separation of the data into organism-specific bins. Then the taxon-specific scaling of organism profiles yields a valid normalization and allows us to recombine the scaled profiles into a metatranscriptomic count matrix. This matrix can then be analyzed with statistical tools for transcriptomic count data. For taxon-specific scaling and recombination of scaled counts we provide a simple R script. Results When applying transcriptomic tools for differential expression analysis directly to metatranscriptomic data with an organism-independent (global) scaling of counts the resulting differences may be difficult to interpret. The differences may correspond to changing functional profiles of the contributing organisms but may also result from a variation of taxonomic abundances. Taxon-specific scaling eliminates this variation and therefore the resulting differences actually reflect a different behavior of organisms under changing conditions. In simulation studies we show that the divergence between results from global and taxon-specific scaling can be drastic. In particular, the variation of organism abundances can imply a considerable increase of significant differences with global scaling. Also, on real metatranscriptomic data, the predictions from taxon-specific and global scaling can differ widely. Our studies indicate that in real data applications performed with global scaling it might be impossible to distinguish between differential expression in terms of transcriptomic changes and differential composition in terms of changing taxonomic proportions. Conclusions As in transcriptomics, a proper normalization of count data is also essential for differential expression analysis in metatranscriptomics. Our model implies a taxon-specific scaling of counts for normalization of the data. The application of taxon-specific scaling consequently removes taxonomic composition variations from functional profiles and therefore provides a clear interpretation of the observed functional differences.},

Faster, cheaper sequencing technologies and the ability to sequence uncultured microbes sampled directly from their habitats are expanding and transforming our view of the microbial world. Distilling meaningful information from the millions of new genomic sequences presents a serious challenge to bioinformaticians. In cultured microbes, the genomic data come from a single clone, making sequence assembly and annotation tractable. In metagenomics, the data come from heterogeneous microbial communities, sometimes containing more than 10,000 species, with the sequence data being noisy and partial. From sampling, to assembly, to gene calling and function prediction, bioinformatics faces new demands in interpreting voluminous, noisy, and often partial sequence data. Although metagenomics is a relative newcomer to science, the past few years have seen an explosion in computational methods applied to metagenomic-based research. It is therefore not within the scope of this article to provide an exhaustive review. Rather, we provide here a concise yet comprehensive introduction to the current computational requirements presented by metagenomics, and review the recent progress made.

Our approach centers on the idea of using the $\alpha$-transformation to transform the data and then to classify the transformed data via regularized discriminant analysis and the k-nearest neighbors algorithm. Using the $\alpha$-transformation generalizes two rival approaches in compositional data analysis, one (when $\alpha$=1) that treats the data as though they were Euclidean, ignoring the compositional constraint, and another (when $\alpha$ = 0) that employs Aitchison{\textquoteright}s centered log-ratio transformation. A numerical study with several real datasets shows that whether using $\alpha$ = 1 or $\alpha$ = 0 gives better classification performance depends on the dataset, and moreover that using an intermediate value of $\alpha$ can sometimes give better performance than using either 1 or 0.},

This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial.

	abstract = {A causal role of mutations in multiple general transcription factors in neurodevelopmental disorders including autism suggested that alterations in global levels of gene expression regulation might also relate to disease risk in sporadic cases of autism. This premise can be tested by evaluating for changes in the overall distribution of gene expression levels. For instance, in mice, variability in hippocampal-dependent behaviors was associated with variability in the pattern of the overall distribution of gene expression levels, as assessed by variance in the distribution of gene expression levels in the hippocampus. We hypothesized that a similar change in variance might be found in children with autism. Gene expression microarrays covering greater than 47,000 unique RNA transcripts were done on RNA from peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) of children with autism (n?=?82) and controls (n?=?64). Variance in the distribution of gene expression levels from each microarray was compared between groups of children. Also tested was whether a risk factor for autism, increased paternal age, was associated with variance. A decrease in the variance in the distribution of gene expression levels in PBL was associated with the diagnosis of autism and a risk factor for autism, increased paternal age. Traditional approaches to microarray analysis of gene expression suggested a possible mechanism for decreased variance in gene expression. Gene expression pathways involved in transcriptional regulation were down-regulated in the blood of children with autism and children of older fathers. Thus, results from global and gene specific approaches to studying microarray data were complimentary and supported the hypothesis that alterations at the global level of gene expression regulation are related to autism and increased paternal age. Global regulation of transcription, thus, represents a possible point of convergence for multiple etiologies of autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by abnormalities in reciprocal social interactions and language development and/or usage, and by restricted interests and repetitive behaviors. Differential gene expression of neurologically relevant genes in lymphoblastoid cell lines from monozygotic twins discordant in diagnosis or severity of autism suggested that epigenetic factors such as DNA methylation or microRNAs (miRNAs) may be involved in ASD.
METHODS: Global miRNA expression profiling using lymphoblasts derived from these autistic twins and unaffected sibling controls was therefore performed using high-throughput miRNA microarray analysis. Selected differentially expressed miRNAs were confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis, and the putative target genes of two of the confirmed miRNA were validated by knockdown and overexpression of the respective miRNAs.
RESULTS: Differentially expressed miRNAs were found to target genes highly involved in neurological functions and disorders in addition to genes involved in gastrointestinal diseases, circadian rhythm signaling, as well as steroid hormone metabolism and receptor signaling. Novel network analyses of the putative target genes that were inversely expressed relative to the relevant miRNA in these same samples further revealed an association with ASD and other co-morbid disorders, including muscle and gastrointestinal diseases, as well as with biological functions implicated in ASD, such as memory and synaptic plasticity. Putative gene targets (ID3 and PLK2) of two RT-PCR-confirmed brain-specific miRNAs (hsa-miR-29b and hsa-miR-219-5p) were validated by miRNA overexpression or knockdown assays, respectively. Comparisons of these mRNA and miRNA expression levels between discordant twins and between case-control sib pairs show an inverse relationship, further suggesting that ID3 and PLK2 are in vivo targets of the respective miRNA. Interestingly, the up-regulation of miR-23a and down-regulation of miR-106b in this study reflected miRNA changes previously reported in post-mortem autistic cerebellum by Abu-Elneel et al. in 2008. This finding validates these differentially expressed miRNAs in neurological tissue from a different cohort as well as supports the use of the lymphoblasts as a surrogate to study miRNA expression in ASD.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study strongly suggest that dysregulation of miRNA expression contributes to the observed alterations in gene expression and, in turn, may lead to the pathophysiological conditions underlying autism.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Over the past decade genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been applied to aid in the understanding of the biology of traits. The success of this approach is governed by the underlying effect sizes carried by the true risk variants and the corresponding statistical power to observe such effects given the study design and sample size under investigation. Previous ASD GWAS have identified genome-wide significant (GWS) risk loci; however, these studies were of only of low statistical power to identify GWS loci at the lower effect sizes (odds ratio (OR) {\textless}1.15).
METHODS: We conducted a large-scale coordinated international collaboration to combine independent genotyping data to improve the statistical power and aid in robust discovery of GWS loci. This study uses genome-wide genotyping data from a discovery sample (7387 ASD cases and 8567 controls) followed by meta-analysis of summary statistics from two replication sets (7783 ASD cases and 11359 controls; and 1369 ASD cases and 137308 controls).
RESULTS: We observe a GWS locus at 10q24.32 that overlaps several genes includingPITX3, which encodes a transcription factor identified as playing a role in neuronal differentiation andCUEDC2previously reported to be associated with social skills in an independent population cohort. We also observe overlap with regions previously implicated in schizophrenia which was further supported by a strong genetic correlation between these disorders (Rg = 0.23;P = 9 {\texttimes} 10-6). We further combined these Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) ASD GWAS data with the recent PGC schizophrenia GWAS to identify additional regions which may be important in a common neurodevelopmental phenotype and identified 12 novel GWS loci. These include loci previously implicated in ASD such asFOXP1at 3p13,ATP2B2at 3p25.3, and a 'neurodevelopmental hub' on chromosome 8p11.23.
CONCLUSIONS: This study is an important step in the ongoing endeavour to identify the loci which underpin the common variant signal in ASD. In addition to novel GWS loci, we have identified a significant genetic correlation with schizophrenia and association of ASD with several neurodevelopmental-related genes such asEXT1,ASTN2,MACROD2, andHDAC4.},

To reduce false positives, only genes that overlapped these three ANCOVAs were considered. Thus, 48 probe sets correlated with lead levels in both AU and TD subjects and were significantly different between the groups (p(Diagnosis x log$_{2}$Pb) {\textless} 0.05). These genes were related mainly to immune and inflammatory processes, including MHC Class II family members and CD74. A large number (n = 791) of probe sets correlated (P <= 0.05) with lead levels in TD but not in AU subjects; and many probe sets (n = 162) correlated (P <= 0.05) with lead levels in AU but not in TD subjects. Only 30 probe sets correlated (P <= 0.05) with lead levels in a similar manner in the AU and TD groups. These data show that AU and TD children display different associations between transcript levels and low levels of lead.

RNA was isolated from blood and gene expression assessed on whole genome Affymetrix Human U133 expression microarrays. Mercury levels were measured using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed and partial correlations between gene expression and mercury levels were calculated, after correcting for age and batch effects. To reduce false positives, only genes shared by the ANCOVA models were analyzed. Of the 26 genes that correlated with mercury levels in both AU and TD boys, 11 were significantly different between the groups (P(Diagnosis*Mercury)~<=~0.05). The expression of a large number of genes (n~=~316) correlated with mercury levels in TD but not in AU boys (P~<=~0.05), the most represented biological functions being cell death and cell morphology. Expression of 189 genes correlated with mercury levels in AU but not in TD boys (P~<=~0.05), the most represented biological functions being cell morphology, amino acid metabolism, and antigen presentation. These data and those in our companion study on correlation of gene expression and lead levels show that AU and TD children display different correlations between transcript levels and low levels of mercury and lead.

	abstract = {Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) is a spectrum of highly heritable neurodevelopmental disorders in which known mutations contribute to disease risk in 20\% of cases. Here, we report the results of the largest blood transcriptome study to date that aims to identify differences in 170 ASD cases and 115 age/sex-matched controls and to evaluate the utility of gene expression profiling as a tool to aid in the diagnosis of ASD. The differentially expressed genes were enriched for the neurotrophin signaling, long-term potentiation/depression, and notch signaling pathways. We developed a 55-gene prediction model, using a cross-validation strategy, on a sample cohort of 66 male ASD cases and 33 age-matched male controls (P1). Subsequently, 104 ASD cases and 82 controls were recruited and used as a validation set (P2). This 55-gene expression signature achieved 68\% classification accuracy with the validation cohort (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC): 0.70 [95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.62-0.77]). Not surprisingly, our prediction model that was built and trained with male samples performed well for males (AUC 0.73, 95\% CI 0.65-0.82), but not for female samples (AUC 0.51, 95\% CI 0.36-0.67). The 55-gene signature also performed robustly when the prediction model was trained with P2 male samples to classify P1 samples (AUC 0.69, 95\% CI 0.58-0.80). Our result suggests that the use of blood expression profiling for ASD detection may be feasible. Further study is required to determine the age at which such a test should be deployed, and what genetic characteristics of ASD can be identified.},

Transcriptional profiles were compared with age- and gender-matched, typically developing children from the general population (GP). The AU group was subdivided based on a history of developmental regression (A-R) or a history of early onset (A-E without regression). Total RNA from blood was processed on human Affymetrix microarrays. Thirty-five children with AU (17 with early onset autism and 18 with autism with regression) and 14 ASD children (who did not meet criteria for AU) were compared to 12 GP children. Unpaired t tests (corrected for multiple comparisons with a false discovery rate of 0.05) detected a number of genes that were regulated more than 1.5-fold for AU versus GP (n=55 genes), for A-E versus GP (n=140 genes), for A-R versus GP (n=20 genes), and for A-R versus A-E (n=494 genes). No genes were significantly regulated for ASD versus GP. There were 11 genes shared between the comparisons of all autism subgroups to GP (AU, A-E, and A-R versus GP) and these genes were all expressed in natural killer cells and many belonged to the KEGG natural killer cytotoxicity pathway (p=0.02). A subset of these genes (n=7) was tested with qRT-PCR and all genes were found to be differentially expressed (p{\textless}0.05).

	abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is one of the most prevalent neurodevelopmental disorders with high heritability, yet a majority of genetic contribution to pathophysiology is not known. Siblings of individuals with ASD are at increased risk for ASD and autistic traits, but the genetic contribution for simplex families is estimated to be less when compared to multiplex families. To explore the genomic (dis-) similarity between proband and unaffected sibling in simplex families, we used genome-wide gene expression profiles of blood from 20 proband-unaffected sibling pairs and 18 unrelated control individuals. The global gene expression profiles of unaffected siblings were more similar to those from probands as they shared genetic and environmental background. A total of 189 genes were significantly differentially expressed between proband-sib pairs (nominal p {\textless} 0.01) after controlling for age, sex, and family effects. Probands and siblings were distinguished into two groups by cluster analysis with these genes. Overall, unaffected siblings were equally distant from the centroid of probands and from that of unrelated controls with the differentially expressed genes. Interestingly, five of 20 siblings had gene expression profiles that were more similar to unrelated controls than to their matched probands. In summary, we found a set of genes that distinguished probands from the unaffected siblings, and a subgroup of unaffected siblings who were more similar to probands. The pathways that characterized probands compared to siblings using peripheral blood gene expression profiles were the up-regulation of ribosomal, spliceosomal, and mitochondrial pathways, and the down-regulation of neuroreceptor-ligand, immune response and calcium signaling pathways. Further integrative study with structural genetic variations such as de novo mutations, rare variants, and copy number variations would clarify whether these transcriptomic changes are structural or environmental in origin.},

	abstract = {Causes and contributing factors for autism are poorly understood. Evidence suggests that prevalence is rising, but the extent to which diagnostic changes and improvements in ascertainment contribute to this increase is unclear. Both genetic and environmental factors are likely to contribute etiologically. Evidence from twin, family, and genetic studies supports a role for an inherited predisposition to the development of autism. Nonetheless, clinical, neuroanatomic, neurophysiologic, and epidemiologic studies suggest that gene penetrance and expression may be influenced, in some cases strongly, by the prenatal and early postnatal environmental milieu. Sporadic studies link autism to xenobiotic chemicals and/or viruses, but few methodologically rigorous investigations have been undertaken. In light of major gaps in understanding of autism, a large case-control investigation of underlying environmental and genetic causes for autism and triggers of regression has been launched. The CHARGE (Childhood Autism Risks from Genetics and Environment) study will address a wide spectrum of chemical and biologic exposures, susceptibility factors, and their interactions. Phenotypic variation among children with autism will be explored, as will similarities and differences with developmental delay. The CHARGE study infrastructure includes detailed developmental assessments, medical information, questionnaire data, and biologic specimens. The CHARGE study is linked to University of California-Davis Center for Children's Environmental Health laboratories in immunology, xenobiotic measurement, cell signaling, genomics, and proteomics.

	abstract = {Correlation is ubiquitously used in gene expression analysis although its validity as an objective criterion is often questionable. If no normalization reflecting the original mRNA counts in the cells is available, correlation between genes becomes spurious. Yet the need for normalization can be bypassed using a relative analysis approach called log-ratio analysis. This approach can be used to identify proportional gene pairs, i.e. a subset of pairs whose correlation can be inferred correctly from unnormalized data due to their vanishing log-ratio variance. To interpret the size of non-zero log-ratio variances, a proposal for a scaling with respect to the variance of one member of the gene pair was recently made by Lovell et al. Here we derive analytically how spurious proportionality is introduced when using a scaling. We base our analysis on a symmetric proportionality coefficient (briefly mentioned in Lovell et al.) that has a number of advantages over their statistic. We show in detail how the choice of reference needed for the scaling determines which gene pairs are identified as proportional. We demonstrate that using an unchanged gene as a reference has huge advantages in terms of sensitivity. We also explore the link between proportionality and partial correlation and derive expressions for a partial proportionality coefficient. A brief data-analysis part puts the discussed concepts into practice.},

	abstract = {Genome-wide expression studies of samples derived from individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and their unaffected siblings have been widely used to shed light on transcriptomic differences associated with this condition. Females have historically been under-represented in ASD genomic studies. Emerging evidence from studies of structural genetic variants and peripheral biomarkers suggest that sex-differences may exist in the biological correlates of ASD. Relatively few studies have explicitly examined whether sex-differences exist in the transcriptomic signature of ASD. The present study quantified genome-wide expression values by performing RNA sequencing on transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines and identified transcripts differentially expressed between same-sex, proximal-aged sibling pairs. We found that performing separate analyses for each sex improved our ability to detect ASD-related transcriptomic differences; we observed a larger number of dysregulated genes within our smaller set of female samples (n = 12 sibling pairs), as compared with the set of male samples (n = 24 sibling pairs), with small, but statistically significant overlap between the sexes. Permutation-based gene-set analyses and weighted gene co-expression network analyses also supported the idea that the transcriptomic signature of ASD may differ between males and females. We discuss our findings in the context of the relevant literature, underscoring the need for future ASD studies to explicitly account for differences between the sexes.

In addition to the measured variable(s) of interest, there will tend to be sources of signal due to factors that are unknown, unmeasured, or too complicated to capture through simple models. We show that failing to incorporate these sources of heterogeneity into an analysis can have widespread and detrimental effects on the study. Not only can this reduce power or induce unwanted dependence across genes, but it can also introduce sources of spurious signal to many genes. This phenomenon is true even for well-designed, randomized studies. We introduce {\textquotedblleft}surrogate variable analysis{\textquotedblright} (SVA) to overcome the problems caused by heterogeneity in expression studies. SVA can be applied in conjunction with standard analysis techniques to accurately capture the relationship between expression and any modeled variables of interest. We apply SVA to disease class, time course, and genetics of gene expression studies. We show that SVA increases the biological accuracy and reproducibility of analyses in genome-wide expression studies.},

The ability to combine microarray data sets is advantageous to researchers to increase statistical power to detect biological phenomena from studies where logistical considerations restrict sample size or in studies that require the sequential hybridization of arrays. In general, it is inappropriate to combine data sets without adjusting for batch effects. Methods have been proposed to filter batch effects from data, but these are often complicated and require large batch sizes ( {\textgreater} 25) to implement. Because the majority of microarray studies are conducted using much smaller sample sizes, existing methods are not sufficient. We propose parametric and non-parametric empirical Bayes frameworks for adjusting data for batch effects that is robust to outliers in small sample sizes and performs comparable to existing methods for large samples. We illustrate our methods using two example data sets and show that our methods are justifiable, easy to apply, and useful in practice.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exposure to ambient air pollution is widespread and may be detrimental to human brain development and a potential risk factor for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). We conducted a systematic review of the human evidence on the relationship between ASD and exposure to all airborne pollutants, including particulate matter air pollutants and others (e.g. pesticides and metals).
OBJECTIVE: To answer the question: "is developmental exposure to air pollution associated with ASD?"
METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search of the literature, identified relevant studies using inclusion/exclusion criteria pre-specified in our protocol (registered in PROSPERO, CRD \# 42015017890), evaluated the potential risk of bias for each included study and identified an appropriate subset of studies to combine in a meta-analysis. We then rated the overall quality and strength of the evidence collectively across all air pollutants.
RESULTS: Of 1,158 total references identified, 23 human studies met our inclusion criteria (17 case-control, 4 ecological, 2 cohort). Risk of bias was generally low across studies for most domains; study limitations were related to potential confounding and accuracy of exposure assessment methods. We rated the quality of the body of evidence across all air pollutants as "moderate." From our meta-analysis, we found statistically significant summary odds ratios (ORs) of 1.07 (95\% CI: 1.06, 1.08) per 10-$\mu$g/m3 increase in PM10 exposure (n = 6 studies) and 2.32 (95\% CI: 2.15, 2.51) per 10-$\mu$g/m3 increase in PM2.5 exposure (n = 3 studies). For pollutants not included in a meta-analysis, we collectively evaluated evidence from each study in rating the strength and quality of overall evidence considering factors such as inconsistency, imprecision, and evidence of dose-response. All included studies generally showed increased risk of ASD with increasing exposure to air pollution, although not consistently across all chemical components.
CONCLUSION: After considering strengths and limitations of the body of research, we concluded that there is "limited evidence of toxicity" for the association between early life exposure to air pollution as a whole and diagnosis of ASD. The strongest evidence was between prenatal exposure to particulate matter and ASD. However, the small number of studies in the meta-analysis and unexplained statistical heterogeneity across the individual study estimates means that the effect could be larger or smaller (including not significant) than these studies estimate. Our research supports the need for health protective public policy to reduce exposures to harmful airborne contaminants among pregnant women and children and suggests opportunities for optimizing future research.},

We sought to combine the subject-level data from previously published studies by mega-analysis to increase the statistical power. We identified studies that compared ex vivo blood or lymphocytes from ASD-affected individuals and unrelated comparison subjects using Affymetrix or Illumina array platforms. Raw microarray data and clinical meta-data were obtained from seven studies, totaling 626 affected and 447 comparison subjects. Microarray data were processed using uniform methods. Covariate-controlled mixed-effect linear models were used to identify gene transcripts and co-expression network modules that were significantly associated with diagnostic status. Permutation-based gene-set analysis was used to identify functionally related sets of genes that were over- and under-expressed among ASD samples. Our results were consistent with diminished interferon-, EGF-, PDGF-, PI3K-AKT-mTOR-, and RAS-MAPK-signaling cascades, and increased ribosomal translation and NK-cell related activity in ASD. We explored evidence for sex-differences in the ASD-related transcriptomic signature. We also demonstrated that machine-learning classifiers using blood transcriptome data perform with moderate accuracy when data are combined across studies. Comparing our results with those from blood-based studies of protein biomarkers (e.g., cytokines and trophic factors), we propose that ASD may feature decoupling between certain circulating signaling proteins (higher in ASD samples) and the transcriptional cascades which they typically elicit within circulating immune cells (lower in ASD samples). These findings provide insight into ASD-related transcriptional differences in circulating immune cells. {\textcopyright} 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	doi = {10.3402/mehd.v26.27663},
	abstract = {Background
Understanding the factors regulating our microbiota is important but requires appropriate statistical methodology. When comparing two or more populations most existing approaches either discount the underlying compositional structure in the microbiome data or use probability models such as the multinomial and Dirichlet-multinomial distributions, which may impose a correlation structure not suitable for microbiome data.

Objective
To develop a methodology that accounts for compositional constraints to reduce false discoveries in detecting differentially abundant taxa at an ecosystem level, while maintaining high statistical power.

Methods
We introduced a novel statistical framework called analysis of composition of microbiomes (ANCOM). ANCOM accounts for the underlying structure in the data and can be used for comparing the composition of microbiomes in two or more populations. ANCOM makes no distributional assumptions and can be implemented in a linear model framework to adjust for covariates as well as model longitudinal data. ANCOM also scales well to compare samples involving thousands of taxa.

Results
We compared the performance of ANCOM to the standard t-test and a recently published methodology called Zero Inflated Gaussian (ZIG) methodology () for drawing inferences on the mean taxa abundance in two or more populations. ANCOM controlled the false discovery rate (FDR) at the desired nominal level while also improving power, whereas the t-test and ZIG had inflated FDRs, in some instances as high as 68\% for the t-test and 60\% for ZIG. We illustrate the performance of ANCOM using two publicly available microbial datasets in the human gut, demonstrating its general applicability to testing hypotheses about compositional differences in microbial communities.

Conclusion
Accounting for compositionality using log-ratio analysis results in significantly improved inference in microbiota survey data.},

This is due in part to the large number of bacteria, and the much larger number of interactions (easily in the millions), making experimental investigation very difficult at best and necessitating the nascent field of computational exploration through microbial correlation networks. We benchmark the performance of eight correlation techniques on simulated and real data in response to challenges specific to microbiome studies: fractional sampling of ribosomal RNA sequences, uneven sampling depths, rare microbes and a high proportion of zero counts. Also tested is the ability to distinguish signals from noise, and detect a range of ecological and time-series relationships. Finally, we provide specific recommendations for correlation technique usage. Although some methods perform better than others, there is still considerable need for improvement in current techniques.},

Because the comparison of taxon relative abundance in the specimen is not equivalent to the comparison of taxon relative abundance in the ecosystems, this presents a special challenge. Second, because the relative abundance of taxa in the specimen (as well as in the ecosystem) sum to 1, these are compositional data. Because the compositional data are constrained by the simplex (sum to 1) and are not unconstrained in the Euclidean space, many standard methods of analysis are not applicable.

Differential abundance methods aim at detecting associations between the abundances of bacterial species and subject grouping factors. The results of such methods are important to identify the microbiome as a prognostic or diagnostic biomarker or to demonstrate efficacy of prodrug or antibiotic drugs. Because of a lack of benchmarking studies in the microbiome field, no consensus exists on the performance of the statistical methods. We have compared a large number of popular methods through extensive parametric and nonparametric simulation as well as real data shuffling algorithms. The results are consistent over the different approaches and all point to an alarming excess of false discoveries. This raises great doubts about the reliability of discoveries in past studies and imperils reproducibility of microbiome experiments. To further improve method benchmarking, we introduce a new simulation tool that allows to generate correlated count data following any univariate count distribution; the correlation structure may be inferred from real data. Most simulation studies discard the correlation between species, but our results indicate that this correlation can negatively affect the performance of statistical methods.},

	doi = {10.1093/bioinformatics/btw277},
	abstract = {Motivation: The alignment of sequencing reads to a transcriptome is a common and important step in many RNA-seq analysis tasks. When aligning RNA-seq reads directly to a transcriptome (as is common in the de novo setting or when a trusted reference annotation is available), care must be taken to report the potentially large number of multi-mapping locations per read. This can pose a substantial computational burden for existing aligners, and can considerably slow downstream analysis., Results: We introduce a novel concept, quasi-mapping, and an efficient algorithm implementing this approach for mapping sequencing reads to a transcriptome. By attempting only to report the potential loci of origin of a sequencing read, and not the base-to-base alignment by which it derives from the reference, RapMap{\textemdash}our tool implementing quasi-mapping{\textemdash}is capable of mapping sequencing reads to a target transcriptome substantially faster than existing alignment tools. The algorithm we use to implement quasi-mapping uses several efficient data structures and takes advantage of the special structure of shared sequence prevalent in transcriptomes to rapidly provide highly-accurate mapping information. We demonstrate how quasi-mapping can be successfully applied to the problems of transcript-level quantification from RNA-seq reads and the clustering of contigs from de novo assembled transcriptomes into biologically meaningful groups., Availability and implementation: RapMap is implemented in C ++11 and is available as open-source software, under GPL v3, at https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/RapMap., Contact:

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Understanding the factors regulating our microbiota is important but requires appropriate statistical methodology. When comparing two or more populations most existing approaches either discount the underlying compositional structure in the microbiome data or use probability models such as the multinomial and Dirichlet-multinomial distributions, which may impose a correlation structure not suitable for microbiome data. OBJECTIVE: To develop a methodology that accounts for compositional constraints to reduce false discoveries in detecting differentially abundant taxa at an ecosystem level, while maintaining high statistical power. METHODS: We introduced a novel statistical framework called analysis of composition of microbiomes (ANCOM). ANCOM accounts for the underlying structure in the data and can be used for comparing the composition of microbiomes in two or more populations. ANCOM makes no distributional assumptions and can be implemented in a linear model framework to adjust for covariates as well as model longitudinal data. ANCOM also scales well to compare samples involving thousands of taxa. RESULTS: We compared the performance of ANCOM to the standard t-test and a recently published methodology called Zero Inflated Gaussian (ZIG) methodology (1) for drawing inferences on the mean taxa abundance in two or more populations. ANCOM controlled the false discovery rate (FDR) at the desired nominal level while also improving power, whereas the t-test and ZIG had inflated FDRs, in some instances as high as 68\% for the t-test and 60\% for ZIG. We illustrate the performance of ANCOM using two publicly available microbial datasets in the human gut, demonstrating its general applicability to testing hypotheses about compositional differences in microbial communities. CONCLUSION: Accounting for compositionality using log-ratio analysis results in significantly improved inference in microbiota survey data.},

We maintain, however, that lack of subcompositional coherence (i.e., incoherence) can be measured in an attempt to evaluate whether any given technique is close enough, for all practical purposes, to being subcompositionally coherent. This opens up the field to alternative methods that might be better suited to cope with problems such as data zeros and outliers while being only slightly incoherent. The measure that we propose is based on the distance measure between components. We show that the two-part subcompositions, which appear to be the most sensitive to subcompositional incoherence, can be used to establish a distance matrix that can be directly compared with the pairwise distances in the full composition. The closeness of these two matrices can be quantified using a stress measure that is common in multidimensional scaling, providing a measure of subcompositional incoherence. The approach is illustrated using power-transformed correspondence analysis, which has already been shown to converge to log-ratio analysis as the power transform tends to zero.},

	abstract = {The microbiota of the aged is variously described as being more or less diverse than that of younger cohorts, but the comparison groups used and the definitions of the aged population differ between experiments. The differences are often described by null hypothesis statistical tests, which are notoriously irreproducible when dealing with large multivariate samples. We collected and examined the gut microbiota of a cross-sectional cohort of more than 1,000 very healthy Chinese individuals who spanned ages from 3 to over 100 years. The analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequencing results used a compositional data analysis paradigm coupled with measures of effect size, where ordination, differential abundance, and correlation can be explored and analyzed in a unified and reproducible framework. Our analysis showed several surprising results compared to other cohorts. First, the overall microbiota composition of the healthy aged group was similar to that of people decades younger. Second, the major differences between groups in the gut microbiota profiles were found before age 20. Third, the gut microbiota differed little between individuals from the ages of 30 to {\textgreater}100. Fourth, the gut microbiota of males appeared to be more variable than that of females. Taken together, the present findings suggest that the microbiota of the healthy aged in this cross-sectional study differ little from that of the healthy young in the same population, although the minor variations that do exist depend upon the comparison cohort.
IMPORTANCE We report the large-scale use of compositional data analysis to establish a baseline microbiota composition in an extremely healthy cohort of the Chinese population. This baseline will serve for comparison for future cohorts with chronic or acute disease. In addition to the expected difference in the microbiota of children and adults, we found that the microbiota of the elderly in this population was similar in almost all respects to that of healthy people in the same population who are scores of years younger. We speculate that this similarity is a consequence of an active healthy lifestyle and diet, although cause and effect cannot be ascribed in this (or any other) cross-sectional design. One surprising result was that the gut microbiota of persons in their 20s was distinct from those of other age cohorts, and this result was replicated, suggesting that it is a reproducible finding and distinct from those of other populations.},

	abstract = {Compositional data are nonnegative data with the property of closure: that is, each set of values on their components, or so-called parts, has a fixed sum, usually 1 or 100\%. The approach to compositional data analysis originated by John Aitchison uses ratios of parts as the fundamental starting point for description and modeling. I show that a compositional data set can be effectively replaced by a set of ratios, one less than the number of parts, and that these ratios describe an acyclic connected graph of all the parts. Contrary to recent literature, I show that the additive log-ratio transformation can be an excellent substitute for the original data set, as shown in an archaeological data set as well as in three other examples. I propose further that a smaller set of ratios of parts can be determined, either by expert choice or by automatic selection, which explains as much variance as required for all practical purposes. These part ratios can then be validly summarized and analyzed by conventional univariate methods, as well as multivariate methods, where the ratios are preferably log-transformed.},

Currently most efforts in gene set analysis are focused on differential expression analysis--finding gene sets whose genes show first-order relationship with the clinical outcome.

At the gene set level, capturing the change in expression dynamics is difficult due to the complexity and heterogeneity of the gene sets. Here we report a systematic approach to detect gene sets that show differential coordination patterns with the rest of the transcriptome, as well as pairs of gene sets that are differentially coordinated with each other. We demonstrate that the method can identify biologically relevant gene sets, many of which do not show first-order relationship with the clinical outcome.},

Geochemical data are used widely to help correlate lithostratigraphical sequences, particularly where they are unfossiliferous and/or affected by metamorphism and deformation. In this study, geochemical data for variably impure metamorphosed limestones from the Neoproterozoic {\textemdash} Cambrian Dalradian Supergroup of Scotland have been used to aid lithostratigraphical discrimination and correlation in a region where apparently similar sequences crop out in widely separated regions affected by major deformation.
The key problem in the statistical analysis of geochemical data is that the data are constrained to a constant sum and cannot, therefore, be analysed in raw form by conventional statistical techniques. To overcome this problem, the data have been transformed into log-ratios.
Subsequent statistical analysis of the transformed data focuses on determining the simplest sub-composition that effectively discriminates between the limestones. The results show that the Fe2O3-MgO-CaO subcomposition is sufficient in this regard, with the additional benefit that it reflects the composition of the carbonate component in the limestones. Mann-Whitney tests of the log-ratio Fe2O3/MgO show that limestones from most different lithostratigraphical levels are statistically different from each other at high levels of significance. The results have clarified interpretations of the lithostratigraphy and subsequent interpretations of the tectonic history of the region.},

Ideally compositional data is given by relative portions summing up to 1 or 100 \%. But more often compositional data appear disguised in several ways: different components might be reported in different physical units, different cases might sum up to different totals, and almost never all relevant components are reported. Nevertheless, the constraints of constant sum and relative meaning of the portions have important implications for their statistical analysis, contradicting the typical assumptions of usual uni- and multivariate statistical methods and thus rendering their direct application spurious. A comprehensive statistical methodology, based on a vector space structure of the mathematical simplex, has only been developed very recently, and several software packages are now available to treat compositional data within it. This book is at the same time a textbook on compositional data analysis from a modern perspective and a sort of manual on the R-package {\textquotedblleft}compositions{\textquotedblright}: both R and {\textquotedblleft}compositions{\textquotedblright} are available for download as free software.

Following the principle of working in coordinates and the golden rule of working with log ratios, we can structure a meaningful descriptive analysis of a compositional dataset in the following steps. In the first step, descriptive statistics for central tendency, global spread, and codependence are computed. The second step is a preliminary look at a set of predefined {\textquotedblleft}marginals{\textquotedblright}, i.e., some ternary diagrams, to uncover relations between more than two parts. The third step is the exploration of the codependence structure through the biplot, a joint optimal representation of the variables and of the observations of a composition. Biplots are nevertheless explained in Chap. 6, because of their connection with principal component analysis. One of the aims of all the preceding phases should be to select a reasonable set of projections, or the selection of a basis: if this is achieved, the fourth step should be a classical univariate analysis of each coordinate.},

However, due to the unique properties of community composition data, standard data analysis tools are likely to produce statistical artifacts. For a typical experiment studying microbial ecosystems these artifacts can lead to erroneous conclusions about patterns of associations between microbial taxa. We developed a new procedure that seeks to infer ecological associations between microbial populations, by 1) taking advantage of the proportionality invariance of relative abundance data and 2) making assumptions about the underlying network structure when the number of taxa in the dataset is larger than the number of sampled communities. Additionally, we employed a novel tool to generate biologically plausible synthetic data and objectively benchmark current association inference tools. Finally, we tested our procedures on a large-scale 16S rRNA gene sequencing dataset sampled from the human gut.},

Lonnstedt and Speed (2002) derived an expression for the posterior odds of differential expression in a replicated two-color experiment using a simple hierarchical parametric model. The purpose of this paper is to develop the hierarchical model of Lonnstedt and Speed (2002) into a practical approach for general microarray experiments with arbitrary numbers of treatments and RNA samples. The model is reset in the context of general linear models with arbitrary coefficients and contrasts of interest. The approach applies equally well to both single channel and two color microarray experiments. Consistent, closed form estimators are derived for the hyperparameters in the model. The estimators proposed have robust behavior even for small numbers of arrays and allow for incomplete data arising from spot filtering or spot quality weights. The posterior odds statistic is reformulated in terms of a moderated t-statistic in which posterior residual standard deviations are used in place of ordinary standard deviations. The empirical Bayes approach is equivalent to shrinkage of the estimated sample variances towards a pooled estimate, resulting in far more stable inference when the number of arrays is small. The use of moderated t-statistics has the advantage over the posterior odds that the number of hyperparameters which need to estimated is reduced; in particular, knowledge of the non-null prior for the fold changes are not required. The moderated t-statistic is shown to follow a t-distribution with augmented degrees of freedom. The moderated t inferential approach extends to accommodate tests of composite null hypotheses through the use of moderated F-statistics. The performance of the methods is demonstrated in a simulation study. Results are presented for two publicly available data sets.},

All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package, summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis on recent enhancements and features that have not been previously described.},

These fragments, or {\textquoteleft}reads{\textquoteright}, can be used to measure levels of gene expression and to identify novel splice variants of genes. However, current software for aligning RNA-Seq data to a genome relies on known splice junctions and cannot identify novel ones. TopHat is an efficient read-mapping algorithm designed to align reads from an RNA-Seq experiment to a reference genome without relying on known splice sites., Results: We mapped the RNA-Seq reads from a recent mammalian RNA-Seq experiment and recovered more than 72\% of the splice junctions reported by the annotation-based software from that study, along with nearly 20 000 previously unreported junctions. The TopHat pipeline is much faster than previous systems, mapping nearly 2.2 million reads per CPU hour, which is sufficient to process an entire RNA-Seq experiment in less than a day on a standard desktop computer. We describe several challenges unique to ab initio splice site discovery from RNA-Seq reads that will require further algorithm development., Availability: TopHat is free, open-source software available from http://tophat.cbcb.umd.edu, Contact: cole@cs.umd.edu, Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

NGS facilitates identifying mutations and differentially expressed genes that are causative to diseases. However, its high-throughput feature poses major challenges in performing the analysis, especially the alignment step. The alignment step is critical in the NGS gene expression analysis since the correctness of the advanced steps heavily depends on it. Therefore, we evaluated the performances of the four popular alignment algorithms including Tophat, STAR, MapSplice, and GNSAP based on the simulated data generated by Flux-Simulator. Shorter and longer reference genomes and read lengths were evaluated in the four scenarios. Three indices including time cost, alignment accuracy, and junction detection were utilized to consider the performances of different algorithms. The result shows that the Tophat algorithm has highest alignment accuracy and the STAR algorithm is the fastest one with a little lower accuracy. The MapSplice and GNSAP algorithms are not stable as the STAR and Tophat algorithms, and might encounter more problems in doing the alignment.},

	abstract = {Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) overcomes limitations of previously used RNA quantification methods and provides one experimental framework for both high-throughput characterization and quantification of transcripts at the nucleotide level. The first step and a major challenge in the analysis of such experiments is the mapping of sequencing reads to a transcriptomic origin including the identification of splicing events. In recent years, a large number of such mapping algorithms have been developed, all of which have in common that they require algorithms for aligning a vast number of reads to genomic or transcriptomic sequences. Although the FM-index based aligner Bowtie has become a de facto standard within mapping pipelines, a much larger number of possible alignment algorithms have been developed also including other variants of FM-index based aligners. Accordingly, developers and users of RNA-seq mapping pipelines have the choice among a large number of available alignment algorithms. To provide guidance in the choice of alignment algorithms for these purposes, we evaluated the performance of 14 widely used alignment programs from three different algorithmic classes: algorithms using either hashing of the reference transcriptome, hashing of reads, or a compressed FM-index representation of the genome. Here, special emphasis was placed on both precision and recall and the performance for different read lengths and numbers of mismatches and indels in a read. Our results clearly showed the significant reduction in memory footprint and runtime provided by FM-index based aligners at a precision and recall comparable to the best hash table based aligners. Furthermore, the recently developed Bowtie 2 alignment algorithm shows a remarkable tolerance to both sequencing errors and indels, thus, essentially making hash-based aligners obsolete.},

Alignment is especially complicated for RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) because of RNA splicing. A number of RNA-Seq algorithms are available, and claim to align reads with high accuracy and efficiency while detecting splice junctions. RNA-Seq data are discrete in nature; therefore, with reasonable gene models and comparative metrics RNA-Seq data can be simulated to sufficient accuracy to enable meaningful benchmarking of alignment algorithms. The exercise to rigorously compare all viable published RNA-Seq algorithms has not been performed previously.Results: We developed an RNA-Seq simulator that models the main impediments to RNA alignment, including alternative splicing, insertions, deletions, substitutions, sequencing errors and intron signal. We used this simulator to measure the accuracy and robustness of available algorithms at the base and junction levels. Additionally, we used reverse transcription{\textendash}polymerase chain reaction (RT{\textendash}PCR) and Sanger sequencing to validate the ability of the algorithms to detect novel transcript features such as novel exons and alternative splicing in RNA-Seq data from mouse retina. A pipeline based on BLAT was developed to explore the performance of established tools for this problem, and to compare it to the recently developed methods. This pipeline, the RNA-Seq Unified Mapper (RUM), performs comparably to the best current aligners and provides an advantageous combination of accuracy, speed and usability.Availability: The RUM pipeline is distributed via the Amazon Cloud and for computing clusters using the Sun Grid Engine (http://cbil.upenn.edu/RUM).Contact:ggrant@pcbi.upenn.edu; epierce@mail.med.upenn.eduSupplementary Information:The RNA-Seq sequence reads described in the article are deposited at GEO, accession GSE26248.},

This typically requires aligning the short reads generated to the genome or transcriptome before quantifying expression of pre-defined sets of genes. Differences in the alignment/quantification tools can have a major effect upon the expression levels found with important consequences for biological interpretation. Here we address two main issues: do different analysis pipelines affect the gene expression levels inferred from RNA-seq data? And, how close are the expression levels inferred to the "true" expression levels? We evaluate fifty gene profiling pipelines in experimental and simulated data sets with different characteristics (e.g, read length and sequencing depth). In the absence of knowledge of the 'ground truth' in real RNAseq data sets, we used simulated data to assess the differences between the "true" expression and those reconstructed by the analysis pipelines. Even though this approach does not take into account all known biases present in RNAseq data, it still allows to estimate the accuracy of the gene expression values inferred by different analysis pipelines. The results show that i) overall there is a high correlation between the expression levels inferred by the best pipelines and the true quantification values; ii) the error in the estimated gene expression values can vary considerably across genes; and iii) a small set of genes have expression estimates with consistently high error (across data sets and methods). Finally, although the mapping software is important, the quantification method makes a greater difference to the results.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Because of the advantages of RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) over microarrays, it is gaining widespread popularity for highly parallel gene expression analysis. For example, RNA-Seq is expected to be able to provide accurate identification and quantification of full-length splice forms. A number of informatics packages have been developed for this purpose, but short reads make it a difficult problem in principle. Sequencing error and polymorphisms add further complications. It has become necessary to perform studies to determine which algorithms perform best and which if any algorithms perform adequately. However, there is a dearth of independent and unbiased benchmarking studies. Here we take an approach using both simulated and experimental benchmark data to evaluate their accuracy.
RESULTS: We conclude that most methods are inaccurate even using idealized data, and that no method is highly accurate once multiple splice forms, polymorphisms, intron signal, sequencing errors, alignment errors, annotation errors and other complicating factors are present. These results point to the pressing need for further algorithm development.

Moreover, comparative studies have been performed considering separately the changes in absolute or relative isoform expression levels. Consequently, no consensus exists about the best practices and appropriate workflows to analyse alternative and differential splicing. To assist the adequate pipeline choice, we present here a benchmarking of nine commonly used workflows to detect differential isoform expression and splicing. We evaluated the workflows performance over three different experimental scenarios where changes in absolute and relative isoform expression occurred simultaneously. In addition, the effect of the number of isoforms per gene, and the magnitude of the expression change over pipeline performances were also evaluated. Our results suggest that workflow performance is influenced by the number of replicates per condition and the conditions heterogeneity. In general, workflows based on DESeq, DEXSeq, Limma and NOISeq performed well over a wide range of transcriptomics experiments. In particular, we suggest the use of workflows based on Limma when high precision is required, and DESeq2 and DEXseq pipelines to prioritize sensitivity. When several replicates per condition are available, NOISeq and Limma pipelines are indicated.},

	abstract = {RNA-seq is now the technology of choice for genome-wide differential gene expression experiments, but it is not clear how many biological replicates are needed to ensure valid biological interpretation of the results or which statistical tools are best for analyzing the data. An RNA-seq experiment with 48 biological replicates in each of two conditions was performed to answer these questions and provide guidelines for experimental design. With three biological replicates, nine of the 11 tools evaluated found only 20\%-40\% of the significantly differentially expressed (SDE) genes identified with the full set of 42 clean replicates. This rises to {\textgreater}85\% for the subset of SDE genes changing in expression by more than fourfold. To achieve {\textgreater}85\% for all SDE genes regardless of fold change requires more than 20 biological replicates. The same nine tools successfully control their false discovery rate at ?5\% for all numbers of replicates, while the remaining two tools fail to control their FDR adequately, particularly for low numbers of replicates. For future RNA-seq experiments, these results suggest that at least six biological replicates should be used, rising to at least 12 when it is important to identify SDE genes for all fold changes. If fewer than 12 replicates are used, a superior combination of true positive and false positive performances makes edgeR and DESeq2 the leading tools. For higher replicate numbers, minimizing false positives is more important and DESeq marginally outperforms the other tools.},

	abstract = {Background
Several recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of deep sequencing for transcriptome analysis (RNA-seq) in mammals. As RNA-seq becomes more affordable, whole genome transcriptional profiling is likely to become the platform of choice for species with good genomic sequences. As yet, a rigorous analysis methodology has not been developed and we are still in the stages of exploring the features of the data.

Results
We investigated the effect of transcript length bias in RNA-seq data using three different published data sets. For standard analyses using aggregated tag counts for each gene, the ability to call differentially expressed genes between samples is strongly associated with the length of the transcript.

Conclusion
Transcript length bias for calling differentially expressed genes is a general feature of current protocols for RNA-seq technology. This has implications for the ranking of differentially expressed genes, and in particular may introduce bias in gene set testing for pathway analysis and other multi-gene systems biology analyses.

We detected 13,692 known transcripts and 3,724 previously unannotated ones, 62\% of which are supported by independent expression data or by homologous genes in other species. Over the time series, 330 genes showed complete switches in the dominant transcription start site (TSS) or splice isoform, and we observed more subtle shifts in 1,304 other genes.

Subsequent analysis of such data can yield information on tran- scription profiles, microbial diversity, or even relative cellular abundance in culture. Because of the high cost of acquisition, the data are usually sparse, and always contain far fewer observations than variables. However, an under-appreciated pathology of these data are their often unbalanced nature: i.e, there is often systematic variation between groups simply due to presence or absence of features, and this variation is important to the biological interpretation of the data. A simple example would be comparing transcriptomes of yeast cells with and without a gene knockout. This causes samples in the comparison groups to exhibit widely varying centres. This work extends a previously described log-ratio transformation method that allows for variable comparisons between samples in a Bayesian compositional context. We demonstrate the pathology in modelled and real unbalanced experimental designs to show how this dramatically causes both false negative and false positive inference. We then introduce several approaches to demonstrate how the pathologies can be addressed. An extreme example is presented where only the use of a predefined basis is appropriate. The transformations are implemented as an extension to a general compositional data analysis tool known as ALDEx2 which is available on Bioconductor.},

	abstract = {Normalization is an essential step with considerable impact on high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data analysis. Although there are numerous methods for read count normalization, it remains a challenge to choose an optimal method due to multiple factors contributing to read count variability that affects the overall sensitivity and specificity. In order to properly determine the most appropriate normalization methods, it is critical to compare the performance and shortcomings of a representative set of normalization routines based on different dataset characteristics. Therefore, we set out to evaluate the performance of the commonly used methods (DESeq, TMM-edgeR, FPKM-CuffDiff, TC, Med UQ and FQ) and two new methods we propose: Med-pgQ2 and UQ-pgQ2 (per-gene normalization after per-sample median or upper-quartile global scaling). Our per-gene normalization approach allows for comparisons between conditions based on similar count levels. Using the benchmark Microarray Quality Control Project (MAQC) and simulated datasets, we performed differential gene expression analysis to evaluate these methods. When evaluating MAQC2 with two replicates, we observed that Med-pgQ2 and UQ-pgQ2 achieved a slightly higher area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC), a specificity rate {\textgreater} 85\%, the detection power {\textgreater} 92\% and an actual false discovery rate (FDR) under 0.06 given the nominal FDR (<=0.05). Although the top commonly used methods (DESeq and TMM-edgeR) yield a higher power ({\textgreater}93\%) for MAQC2 data, they trade off with a reduced specificity ({\textless}70\%) and a slightly higher actual FDR than our proposed methods. In addition, the results from an analysis based on the qualitative characteristics of sample distribution for MAQC2 and human breast cancer datasets show that only our gene-wise normalization methods corrected data skewed towards lower read counts. However, when we evaluated MAQC3 with less variation in five replicates, all methods performed similarly. Thus, our proposed Med-pgQ2 and UQ-pgQ2 methods perform slightly better for differential gene analysis of RNA-seq data skewed towards lowly expressed read counts with high variation by improving specificity while maintaining a good detection power with a control of the nominal FDR level.},

Recently, environmental microbiologists have started using metatranscriptomics and metaproteomics to look at gene expression differences between different environments or conditions. This has been mostly done by using makeshift adaptations of pure culture focused differential transcriptomics and proteomics approaches. However, since meta-omics data has many more variables attached to it as compared to pure culture derived data, such makeshift adaptations are problematic at best. One particular challenge is posed by the data normalization strategies used to account for technical and biological variables in meta-omic data. Here I discuss the most common normalization strategy for transcriptomic and proteomic data and why it is not valid by itself for meta-omic data. I provide logical proof that variation in species abundances between samples is an additional variable that must be accounted for during normalization of meta-omic data. Finally, I show how the existing normalization methods for transcriptomic and proteomic data can be augmented to be applicable to meta-omic data.},

	doi = {10.1038/ijo.2014.46},
	abstract = {Background: Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) are produced by colonic microbiota from dietary carbohydrates and proteins that reach the colon. It has been suggested that SCFA may promote obesity via increased colonic energy availability. Recent studies suggest obese humans have higher faecal SCFA than lean, but it is unclear whether this difference is due to increased SCFA production or reduced absorption.
Objectives: To compare rectal SCFA absorption, dietary intake and faecal microbial profile in lean (LN) versus overweight and obese (OWO) individuals.
Design: Eleven LN and eleven OWO individuals completed a 3-day diet record, provided a fresh faecal sample and had SCFA absorption measured using the rectal dialysis bag method. The procedures were repeated after 2 weeks.
Results: Age-adjusted faecal SCFA concentration was significantly higher in OWO than LN individuals (81.3{\textpm}7.4 vs 64.1{\textpm}10.4 mmol kg-1, P=0.023). SCFA absorption (24.4{\textpm}0.8\% vs 24.7{\textpm}1.2\%, respectively, P=0.787) and dietary intakes were similar between the groups, except for a higher fat intake in OWO individuals. However, fat intake did not correlate with SCFAs or bacterial abundance. OWO individuals had higher relative Firmicutes abundance (83.1{\textpm}4.1 vs 69.5{\textpm}5.8\%, respectively, P=0.008) and a higher Firmicutes:Bacteriodetes ratio (P=0.023) than LN individuals. There was a positive correlation between Firmicutes and faecal SCFA within the whole group (r=0.507, P=0.044), with a stronger correlation after adjusting for available carbohydrate (r=0.615, P=0.005).
Conclusions: The higher faecal SCFA in OWO individuals is not because of differences in SCFA absorption or diet. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that OWO individuals produce more colonic SCFA than LN individuals because of differences in colonic microbiota. However, further studies are needed to prove this.},

A promising approach for 'biomarker' discovery has been based on pattern recognition methods applied to neuroimaging data, which could yield clinical utility in future. In this review we survey the literature on pattern recognition for making diagnostic predictions in psychiatric disorders, and evaluate progress made in translating such findings towards clinical application. We evaluate studies on many criteria, including data modalities used, the types of features extracted and algorithm applied. We identify problems common to many studies, such as a relatively small sample size and a primary focus on estimating generalisability within a single study. Furthermore, we highlight challenges that are not widely acknowledged in the field including the importance of accommodating disease prevalence, the necessity of more extensive validation using large carefully acquired samples, the need for methodological innovations to improve accuracy and to discriminate between multiple disorders simultaneously. Finally, we identify specific clinical contexts in which pattern recognition can add value in the short to medium term.},

In the past two decades, the dimensionality of datasets involved in machine learning and data mining applications has increased explosively. Therefore, feature selection has become a necessary step to make the analysis more manageable and to extract useful knowledge about a given domain. A large variety of feature selection techniques are available in literature, and their comparative analysis is a very difficult task. So far, few studies have investigated, from a theoretical and/or experimental point of view, the degree of similarity/dissimilarity among the available techniques, namely the extent to which they tend to produce similar results within specific application contexts. This kind of similarity analysis is of crucial importance when two or more methods are combined in an ensemble fashion: indeed the ensemble paradigm is beneficial only if the involved methods are capable of giving different and complementary representations of the considered domain. This paper gives a contribution in this direction by proposing an empirical approach to evaluate the degree of consistency among the outputs of different selection algorithms in the context of high dimensional classification tasks. Leveraging on a proper similarity index, we systematically compared the feature subsets selected by eight popular selection methods, representatives of different selection approaches, and derived a similarity trend for feature subsets of increasing size. Through an extensive experimentation involving sixteen datasets from three challenging domains (Internet advertisements, text categorization and micro-array data classification), we obtained useful insight into the pattern of agreement of the considered methods. In particular, our results revealed how multivariate selection approaches systematically produce feature subsets that overlap to a small extent with those selected by the other methods.},

However, commonly used estimation methods for the CCC do not accommodate censored observations and are, therefore, not applicable for survival outcomes. In this article, we estimate the CCC nonparametrically through the bivariate survival function. The proposed estimator of the CCC is proven to be strongly consistent and asymptotically normal, with a consistent bootstrap variance estimator. Furthermore, we propose a time-dependent agreement coefficient as an extension of Lin's (1989) CCC for measuring the agreement between survival times among subjects who survive beyond a specified time point. A nonparametric estimator is developed for the time-dependent agreement coefficient as well. It has the same asymptotic properties as the estimator of the CCC. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed estimators. A real data example from a prostate cancer study is used to illustrate the method.},

The relationships between both approaches are pointed out, and their merits are discussed. The related covariance matrices are structurally singular, and this is efficiently dealt with by using generalized inverses. We develop compositional canonical biplots and detail their properties. The canonical biplots are shown to be powerful tools for discovering the most salient relationships between two compositions. Some guidelines for compositional canonical biplots construction are discussed. A geological data set with X-ray fluorescence spectrometry measurements on major oxides and trace elements is used to illustrate the proposed method.

Proportions carry only relative information and are not free to vary independently of one another: for the proportion of one term to increase, one or more others must decrease. These constraints are hallmarks of compositional data. While there has long been discussion in other fields of how such data should be analysed, to our knowledge, Compositional Data Analysis (CoDA) has not been considered in IR. In this work we explore compositional data in IR through the lens of distance measures, and demonstrate that common measures, naive to compositions, have some undesirable properties which can be avoided with composition-aware measures. As a practical example, these measures are shown to improve clustering.},

	abstract = {Gene co-expression networks are increasingly used to explore the system-level functionality of genes. The network construction is conceptually straightforward: nodes represent genes and nodes are connected if the corresponding genes are significantly co-expressed across appropriately chosen tissue samples. In reality, it is tricky to define the connections between the nodes in such networks. An important question is whether it is biologically meaningful to encode gene co-expression using binary information (connected=1, unconnected=0). We describe a general framework for `soft' thresholding that assigns a connection weight to each gene pair. This leads us to define the notion of a weighted gene co-expression network. For soft thresholding we propose several adjacency functions that convert the co-expression measure to a connection weight. For determining the parameters of the adjacency function, we propose a biologically motivated criterion (referred to as the scale-free topology criterion).We generalize the following important network concepts to the case of weighted networks. First, we introduce several node connectivity measures and provide empirical evidence that they can be important for predicting the biological significance of a gene. Second, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that the `weighted' topological overlap measure (used to define gene modules) leads to more cohesive modules than its `unweighted' counterpart. Third, we generalize the clustering coefficient to weighted networks. Unlike the unweighted clustering coefficient, the weighted clustering coefficient is not inversely related to the connectivity. We provide a model that shows how an inverse relationship between clustering coefficient and connectivity arises from hard thresholding.We apply our methods to simulated data, a cancer microarray data set, and a yeast microarray data set.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Alternative splicing is an important mechanism in which the regions of pre-mRNAs are differentially joined in order to form different transcript isoforms. Alternative splicing is involved in the regulation of normal physiological functions but also linked to the development of diseases such as cancer. We analyse differential expression and splicing using RNA-sequencing time series in three different settings: overall gene expression levels, absolute transcript expression levels and relative transcript expression levels., Results: Using estrogen receptor $\alpha$ signaling response as a model system, our Gaussian process-based test identifies genes with differential splicing and/or differentially expressed transcripts. We discover genes with consistent changes in alternative splicing independent of changes in absolute expression and genes where some transcripts change whereas others stay constant in absolute level. The results suggest classes of genes with different modes of alternative splicing regulation during the experiment., Availability and Implementation: R and Matlab codes implementing the method are available at https://github.com/PROBIC/diffsplicing.

We demonstrate that examination of point estimates of the data can result in false positive results, even with appropriate zero replacement approaches, using an in vitro selection dataset with an outside standard of truth. The variation inherent in real high-throughput sequencing datasets is demonstrated, and we show that this varia- tion can be approximated, and hence accounted for, by Monte-Carlo sampling from the Dirichlet distribution. This approximation when used by itself is itself problematic, but becomes useful when coupled with a log-ratio approach commonly used in compositional data analysis. Thus, the approach illustrated here that merges Bayesian estimation with principles of compositional data analysis should be generally useful for high-dimensional count compositional data of the type generated by high throughput sequencing.},

Correlation networks facilitate network based gene screening methods that can be used to identify candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets. These methods have been successfully applied in various biological contexts, e.g. cancer, mouse genetics, yeast genetics, and analysis of brain imaging data.

The Illumina sequencers (including the Genome Analyzers I/II/IIe/IIx and the new HiScan and HiSeq) represent a widely used platform providing parallel readout of several hundred million immobilized sequences using fluorescent-dye reversible-terminator chemistry. Sequencing library quality, sample handling, instrument settings and sequencing chemistry have a strong impact on sequencing run quality. The presence of adapter chimeras and adapter sequences at the end of short-insert molecules, as well as increased error rates and short read lengths complicate many computational analyses. We discuss here some of the factors that influence the frequency and severity of these problems and provide solutions for circumventing these. Further, we present a set of general principles for good analysis practice that enable problems with sequencing runs to be identified and dealt with.},

ASD risk biomarkers expressed early in life could significantly impact diagnosis and treatment, but no transcriptome-wide biomarker classifiers derived from fresh blood samples from children with autism have yet emerged.
METHOD: Using a community-based, prospective, longitudinal method, we identified 60 infants and toddlers at risk for ASDs (autistic disorder and pervasive developmental disorder), 34 at-risk for language delay, 17 at-risk for global developmental delay, and 68 typically developing comparison children. Diagnoses were confirmed via longitudinal follow-up. Each child's mRNA expression profile in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was determined by microarray.
RESULTS: Potential ASD biomarkers were discovered in one-half of the sample and used to build a classifier, with high diagnostic accuracy in the remaining half of the sample.
CONCLUSIONS: The mRNA expression abnormalities reliably observed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which are safely and easily assayed in infants, offer the first potential peripheral blood-based, early biomarker panel of risk for autism in infants and toddlers. Future work should verify these biomarkers and evaluate whether they may also serve as indirect indices of deviant molecular neural mechanisms in autism.},

With such relative{\textemdash}or compositional{\textemdash}data, differential expression needs careful interpretation, and correlation{\textemdash}a statistical workhorse for analyzing pairwise relationships{\textemdash}is an inappropriate measure of association. Using yeast gene expression data we show how correlation can be misleading and present proportionality as a valid alternative for relative data. We show how the strength of proportionality between two variables can be meaningfully and interpretably described by a new statistic $\phi$ which can be used instead of correlation as the basis of familiar analyses and visualisation methods, including co-expression networks and clustered heatmaps. While the main aim of this study is to present proportionality as a means to analyse relative data, it also raises intriguing questions about the molecular mechanisms underlying the proportional regulation of a range of yeast genes., Relative abundance data is common in the life sciences, but appreciation that it needs special analysis and interpretation is scarce. Correlation is popular as a statistical measure of pairwise association but should not be used on data that carry only relative information. Using timecourse yeast gene expression data, we show how correlation of relative abundances can lead to conclusions opposite to those drawn from absolute abundances, and that its value changes when different components are included in the analysis. Once all absolute information has been removed, only a subset of those associations will reliably endure in the remaining relative data, specifically, associations where pairs of values behave proportionally across observations. We propose a new statistic $\phi$ to describe the strength of proportionality between two variables and demonstrate how it can be straightforwardly used instead of correlation as the basis of familiar analyses and visualization methods.},

	abstract = {Summary: It is expected that emerging digital gene expression (DGE) technologies will overtake microarray technologies in the near future for many functional genomics applications. One of the fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression studies, involves determining whether there is evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different across experimental conditions. edgeR is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential expression of replicated count data. An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such as proteome peptide count data., Availability: The package is freely available under the LGPL licence from the Bioconductor web site (http://bioconductor.org)., Contact: mrobinson@wehi.edu.au},

	abstract = {The problem of identifying differentially expressed genes in designed microarray experiments is considered. Lonnstedt and Speed (2002) derived an expression for the posterior odds of differential expression in a replicated two-color experiment using a simple hierarchical parametric model. The purpose of this paper is to develop the hierarchical model of Lonnstedt and Speed (2002) into a practical approach for general microarray experiments with arbitrary numbers of treatments and RNA samples. The model is reset in the context of general linear models with arbitrary coefficients and contrasts of interest. The approach applies equally well to both single channel and two color microarray experiments. Consistent, closed form estimators are derived for the hyperparameters in the model. The estimators proposed have robust behavior even for small numbers of arrays and allow for incomplete data arising from spot filtering or spot quality weights. The posterior odds statistic is reformulated in terms of a moderated t-statistic in which posterior residual standard deviations are used in place of ordinary standard deviations. The empirical Bayes approach is equivalent to shrinkage of the estimated sample variances towards a pooled estimate, resulting in far more stable inference when the number of arrays is small. The use of moderated t-statistics has the advantage over the posterior odds that the number of hyperparameters which need to estimated is reduced; in particular, knowledge of the non-null prior for the fold changes are not required. The moderated t-statistic is shown to follow a t-distribution with augmented degrees of freedom. The moderated t inferential approach extends to accommodate tests of composite null hypotheses through the use of moderated F-statistics. The performance of the methods is demonstrated in a simulation study. Results are presented for two publicly available data sets.},

	abstract = {Novel sequencing technologies permit the rapid production of large sequence data sets. These technologies are likely to revolutionize genetics and biomedical research, but a thorough characterization of the ultra-short read output is necessary. We generated and analyzed two Illumina 1G ultra-short read data sets, i.e. 2.8 million 27mer reads from a Beta vulgaris genomic clone and 12.3 million 36mers from the Helicobacter acinonychis genome. We found that error rates range from 0.3\% at the beginning of reads to 3.8\% at the end of reads. Wrong base calls are frequently preceded by base G. Base substitution error frequencies vary by 10- to 11-fold, with A {\textgreater} C transversion being among the most frequent and C {\textgreater} G transversions among the least frequent substitution errors. Insertions and deletions of single bases occur at very low rates. When simulating re-sequencing we found a 20-fold sequencing coverage to be sufficient to compensate errors by correct reads. The read coverage of the sequenced regions is biased; the highest read density was found in intervals with elevated GC content. High Solexa quality scores are over-optimistic and low scores underestimate the data quality. Our results show different types of biases and ways to detect them. Such biases have implications on the use and interpretation of Solexa data, for de novo sequencing, re-sequencing, the identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms and DNA methylation sites, as well as for transcriptome analysis.},

The main goal was to develop analytical tools for the statistical analysis of compositional data. Our present aim is to get a further insight into some aspects of this geometry in order to clarify the way for more complex statistical approaches. This is done by way of orthonormal bases, which allow for a straightforward handling of geometric elements in the simplex. The transformation into real coordinates preserves all metric properties and is thus called isometric logratio transformation (ilr). An important result is the decomposition of the simplex, as a vector space, into orthogonal subspaces associated with nonoverlapping subcompositions. This gives the key to join compositions with different parts into a single composition by using a balancing element. The relationship between ilr transformations and the centered-logratio (clr) and additive-logratio (alr) transformations is also studied. Exponential growth or decay of mass is used to illustrate compositional linear processes, parallelism and orthogonality in the simplex.},

The integrated data set supports quantitative biology and affords unique insights into cell regulation. Although mRNAs are typically expressed in a narrow range above 1 copy/cell, most long, noncoding RNAs, except for a distinct subset, are tightly repressed below 1 copy/cell. Cell-cycle-regulated transcription tunes mRNA numbers to phase-specific requirements but can also bring about more switch-like expression. Proteins greatly exceed mRNAs in abundance and dynamic range, and concentrations are regulated to functional demands. Upon transition to quiescence, the proteome changes substantially, but, in stark contrast to mRNAs, proteins do not uniformly decrease but scale with cell volume.},

In this work we examine a more general transformation which includes both approaches as special cases. It is a power transformation and involves a single parameter, \{{\textbackslash}alpha\}. The transformation has two equivalent versions. The first is the stay-in-the-simplex version, which is the power transformation as defined by Aitchison in 1986. The second version, which is a linear transformation of the power transformation, is a Box-Cox type transformation. We discuss a parametric way of estimating the value of \{{\textbackslash}alpha\}, which is maximization of its profile likelihood (assuming multivariate normality of the transformed data) and the equivalence between the two versions is exhibited. Other ways include maximization of the correct classification probability in discriminant analysis and maximization of the pseudo R-squared (as defined by Aitchison in 1986) in linear regression. We examine the relationship between the \{{\textbackslash}alpha\}-transformation, the raw data approach and the isometric log-ratio transformation. Furthermore, we also define a suitable family of metrics corresponding to the family of \{{\textbackslash}alpha\}-transformation and consider the corresponding family of Frechet means.},

In order to understand the reasons of the undervaluation of the effects of an incorrect choice of the sample space and, consequently, an incorrect application of the distance concept, case studies of comparison between methodologies will be presented and discussed. The aim is to evaluate the differences in interpretation of geochemical processes affecting rocks, water and gaseous samples, when the two different approaches, classical and compositional, are adopted. If we compare the results of case studies following the two paths it is possible to evaluate which type of error (and consequences) will affect our evaluations in geochemistry.
The presence of expected differences between the two approaches indicates that compositional data analysis can be a way to see beyond the illusion due to the constrained space. However, the possibility that the difference is tenuous in some situations, not revealed a priori, may be at the origin of the unconscious choice of the classical approach. Is this condition which some researchers call {\textquotedblleft}common sense{\textquotedblright} frequently encountered in geochemistry? The paper is aimed to try to answer the proposed question, and to understand the difficulty of diffusion of compositional data analysis even if now simple tools of investigation, for different degrees of knowledge, are available.},

Among fuzzy clustering methods, the FCM algorithm is broadly applied in a variety of fields, but it is not well-behaved when dealing with compositions. Here, the adequacy of different dissimilarities in the simplex, together with the behavior of the common log-ratio transformations, is discussed in the basis of compositional principles. As a result, a well-founded strategy for FCM clustering of compositions is suggested. Theoretical findings are accompanied by numerical evidence, and a detailed account of our proposal is provided. Finally, a case study is illustrated using a nutritional data set known in the clustering literature.},

This variance has several sources: sampling replication, technical replication, variability within biological conditions, and variability between biological conditions.

We show that the partitioning of within-condition to between-condition variation cannot reasonably be ignored, whether in single-organism RNA-Seq or in Meta-RNA-Seq experiments, and further find that commonly-used RNA-Seq analysis tools, as described in the literature, do not enforce the constraint that the sum of relative expression levels must be one, and thus report expression levels that are systematically distorted. These two factors lead to misleading inferences if not properly accommodated. As it is usually only the biological between-condition and within-condition differences that are of interest, we developed ALDEx, an ANOVA-like differential expression procedure, to identify genes with greater between- to within-condition differences. We show that the presence of differential expression and the magnitude of these comparative differences can be reasonably estimated with even very small sample sizes.},

RESULTS: Polyester is an R package designed to simulate RNA-seq data, beginning with an experimental design and ending with collections of RNA-seq reads. Its main advantage is the ability to simulate reads indicating isoform-level differential expression across biological replicates for a variety of experimental designs. Data generated by Polyester is a reasonable approximation to real RNA-seq data and standard differential expression workflows can recover differential expression set in the simulation by the user.

	abstract = {Background
RNA-Seq has supplanted microarrays as the preferred method of transcriptome-wide identification of differentially expressed genes. However, RNA-Seq analysis is still rapidly evolving, with a large number of tools available for each of the three major processing steps: read alignment, expression modeling, and identification of differentially expressed genes. Although some studies have benchmarked these tools against gold standard gene expression sets, few have evaluated their performance in concert with one another. Additionally, there is a general lack of testing of such tools on real-world, physiologically relevant datasets, which often possess qualities not reflected in tightly controlled reference RNA samples or synthetic datasets.

Results
Here, we evaluate 219 combinatorial implementations of the most commonly used analysis tools for their impact on differential gene expression analysis by RNA-Seq. A test dataset was generated using highly purified human classical and nonclassical monocyte subsets from a clinical cohort, allowing us to evaluate the performance of 495 unique workflows, when accounting for differences in expression units and gene- versus transcript-level estimation. We find that the choice of methodologies leads to wide variation in the number of genes called significant, as well as in performance as gauged by precision and recall, calculated by comparing our RNA-Seq results to those from four previously published microarray and BeadChip analyses of the same cell populations. The method of differential gene expression identification exhibited the strongest impact on performance, with smaller impacts from the choice of read aligner and expression modeler. Many workflows were found to exhibit similar overall performance, but with differences in their calibration, with some biased toward higher precision and others toward higher recall.

Conclusions
There is significant heterogeneity in the performance of RNA-Seq workflows to identify differentially expressed genes. Among the higher performing workflows, different workflows exhibit a precision/recall tradeoff, and the ultimate choice of workflow should take into consideration how the results will be used in subsequent applications. Our analyses highlight the performance characteristics of these workflows, and the data generated in this study could also serve as a useful resource for future development of software for RNA-Seq analysis.

	abstract = {Fitting a line to a bivariate dataset can be a deceptively complex problem, and there has been much debate on this issue in the literature. In this review, we describe for the practitioner the essential features of line-fitting methods for estimating the relationship between two variables: what methods are commonly used, which method should be used when, and how to make inferences from these lines to answer common research questions. A particularly important point for line-fitting in allometry is that usually, two sources of error are present (which we call measurement and equation error), and these have quite different implications for choice of line-fitting method. As a consequence, the approach in this review and the methods presented have subtle but important differences from previous reviews in the biology literature. Linear regression, major axis and standardised major axis are alternative methods that can be appropriate when there is no measurement error. When there is measurement error, this often needs to be estimated and used to adjust the variance terms in formulae for line-fitting. We also review line-fitting methods for phylogenetic analyses. Methods of inference are described for the line-fitting techniques discussed in this paper. The types of inference considered here are testing if the slope or elevation equals a given value, constructing confidence intervals for the slope or elevation, comparing several slopes or elevations, and testing for shift along the axis amongst several groups. In some cases several methods have been proposed in the literature. These are discussed and compared. In other cases there is little or no previous guidance available in the literature. Simulations were conducted to check whether the methods of inference proposed have the intended coverage probability or Type I error. We identified the methods of inference that perform well and recommend the techniques that should be adopted in future work.},

We used a newly developed pool of 96 synthetic RNAs with various lengths, and GC content covering a 220 concentration range as spike-in controls to measure sensitivity, accuracy, and biases in RNA-seq experiments as well as to derive standard curves for quantifying the abundance of transcripts. We observed linearity between read density and RNA input over the entire detection range and excellent agreement between replicates, but we observed significantly larger imprecision than expected under pure Poisson sampling errors. We use the control RNAs to directly measure reproducible protocol-dependent biases due to GC content and transcript length as well as stereotypic heterogeneity in coverage across transcripts correlated with position relative to RNA termini and priming sequence bias. These effects lead to biased quantification for short transcripts and individual exons, which is a serious problem for measurements of isoform abundances, but that can partially be corrected using appropriate models of bias. By using the control RNAs, we derive limits for the discovery and detection of rare transcripts in RNA-seq experiments. By using data collected as part of the model organism and human Encyclopedia of DNA Elements projects (ENCODE and modENCODE), we demonstrate that external RNA controls are a useful resource for evaluating sensitivity and accuracy of RNA-seq experiments for transcriptome discovery and quantification.

	doi = {10.1186/s12864-015-2353-z},
	abstract = {Background
A generally accepted approach to the analysis of RNA-Seq read count data does not yet exist. We sequenced the mRNA of 726 individuals from the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel in order to quantify differences in gene expression among single flies. One of our experimental goals was to identify the optimal analysis approach for the detection of differential gene expression among the factors we varied in the experiment: genotype, environment, sex, and their interactions. Here we evaluate three different filtering strategies, eight normalization methods, and two statistical approaches using our data set. We assessed differential gene expression among factors and performed a statistical power analysis using the eight biological replicates per genotype, environment, and sex in our data set.

Results
We found that the most critical considerations for the analysis of RNA-Seq read count data were the normalization method, underlying data distribution assumption, and numbers of biological replicates, an observation consistent with previous RNA-Seq and microarray analysis comparisons. Some common normalization methods, such as Total Count, Quantile, and RPKM normalization, did not align the data across samples. Furthermore, analyses using the Median, Quantile, and Trimmed Mean of M-values normalization methods were sensitive to the removal of low-expressed genes from the data set. Although it is robust in many types of analysis, the normal data distribution assumption produced results vastly different than the negative binomial distribution. In addition, at least three biological replicates per condition were required in order to have sufficient statistical power to detect expression differences among the three-way interaction of genotype, environment, and sex.

Conclusions
The best analysis approach to our data was to normalize the read counts using the DESeq method and apply a generalized linear model assuming a negative binomial distribution using either edgeR or DESeq software. Genes having very low read counts were removed after normalizing the data and fitting it to the negative binomial distribution. We describe the results of this evaluation and include recommended analysis strategies for RNA-Seq read count data.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The ability to properly analyze and interpret large microbiome data sets has lagged behind our ability to acquire such data sets from environmental or clinical samples. Sequencing instruments impose a structure on these data: the natural sample space of a 16S rRNA gene sequencing data set is a simplex, which is a part of real space that is restricted to nonnegative values with a constant sum. Such data are compositional and should be analyzed using compositionally appropriate tools and approaches. However, most of the tools for 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis assume these data are unrestricted.
METHODS: We show that existing tools for compositional data (CoDa) analysis can be readily adapted to analyze high-throughput sequencing data sets.
RESULTS: The Human Microbiome Project tongue versus buccal mucosa data set shows how the CoDa approach can address the major elements of microbiome analysis. Reanalysis of a publicly available autism microbiome data set shows that the CoDa approach in concert with multiple hypothesis test corrections prevent false positive identifications.
CONCLUSIONS: The CoDa approach is readily scalable to microbiome-sized analyses. We provide example code and make recommendations to improve the analysis and reporting of microbiome data sets.},

	abstract = {High-throughput sequencing based techniques, such as 16S rRNA gene profiling, have the potential to elucidate the complex inner workings of natural microbial communities - be they from the world's oceans or the human gut. A key step in exploring such data is the identification of dependencies between members of these communities, which is commonly achieved by correlation analysis. However, it has been known since the days of Karl Pearson that the analysis of the type of data generated by such techniques (referred to as compositional data) can produce unreliable results since the observed data take the form of relative fractions of genes or species, rather than their absolute abundances. Using simulated and real data from the Human Microbiome Project, we show that such compositional effects can be widespread and severe: in some real data sets many of the correlations among taxa can be artifactual, and true correlations may even appear with opposite sign. Additionally, we show that community diversity is the key factor that modulates the acuteness of such compositional effects, and develop a new approach, called SparCC (available at https://bitbucket.org/yonatanf/sparcc), which is capable of estimating correlation values from compositional data. To illustrate a potential application of SparCC, we infer a rich ecological network connecting hundreds of interacting species across 18 sites on the human body. Using the SparCC network as a reference, we estimated that the standard approach yields 3 spurious species-species interactions for each true interaction and misses 60\% of the true interactions in the human microbiome data, and, as predicted, most of the erroneous links are found in the samples with the lowest diversity.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Feature selection is one of the main challenges in analyzing high-throughput genomic data. Minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) is a particularly fast feature selection method for finding a set of both relevant and complementary features. Here we describe the mRMRe R package, in which the mRMR technique is extended by using an ensemble approach to better explore the feature space and build more robust predictors. To deal with the computational complexity of the ensemble approach, the main functions of the package are implemented and parallelized in C using the openMP Application Programming Interface.
Results: Our ensemble mRMR implementations outperform the classical mRMR approach in terms of prediction accuracy. They identify genes more relevant to the biological context and may lead to richer biological interpretations. The parallelized functions included in the package show significant gains in terms of run-time speed when compared with previously released packages.

Several invaders have been shown to exhibit rapid evolutionary changes in response to those pressures, thus providing robust opportunities to clarify the processes at work during rapid phenotypic transitions. The accelerating pace of invasion of cane toads (Rhinella marina) in tropical Australia during its 80-year history has been well characterized at the phenotypic level, including common-garden experiments that demonstrate heritability of several dispersal-relevant traits. Individuals from the invasion front (and their progeny) show distinctive changes in morphology, physiology and behaviour that, in combination, result in far more rapid dispersal than is true of conspecifics from long-colonized areas. The extensive body of work on cane toad ecology enables us to place into context studies of the genetic basis of these traits. Our analyses of differential gene expression from toads from both ends of this invasion-history transect reveal substantial upregulation of many genes, notably those involved in metabolism and cellular repair. Clearly, then, the dramatically rapid phenotypic evolution of cane toads in Australia has been accompanied by substantial shifts in gene expression, suggesting that this system is well suited to investigating the genetic underpinnings of invasiveness.},

The usual Multiclass Feature Selection (MFS) algorithm chooses an identical subset of features for every OvO SVM. We question whether the standard process of applying feature selection and then constructing the multiclass classifier is best. We propose that Individual Feature Selection (IFS) can be directly applied to each binary OvO SVM. More specifically, the proposed method selects different subsets of features for each OvO SVM inside the multiclass classifier so that each vote is optimised to discriminate between the two specific classes. This paper shows that this small change to the normal multiclass SVM improves performance and can also reduce the computing time of feature selection. The proposed IFS method is tested on four different datasets for comparing the performance and time cost. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements compared to the normal MFS method on all four datasets. I.},

Compositional data have intrinsic properties such as a "constant-sum constraint" which should be taken into account when statistically analysing these data. The field of compositional data analysis has greatly improved our understanding of the nature of such compositions and has provided us with insights on statistically rigorous ways of analysing such constrained data. Employment of standard multivariate statistical procedures on compositional data necessitates the use of appropriate transformation procedures, which removes the non-independence of data points, thus rendering the data suitable for such analysis. Here we present the current situation of the analysis of compositional data in chemical ecology; the awareness of this constraint of compositional data; and alternative ways of analysing such constrained data using Random Forests, a data-mining algorithm which has many features that facilitate the analysis of such data. Two such features of particular relevance to compositional data are that Random Forests does not incorporate implicit assumptions about the distribution of the data and can deal with auto-correlations between data points.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Experimental designs that take advantage of high-throughput sequencing to generate datasets include RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), sequencing of 16S rRNA gene fragments, metagenomic analysis and selective growth experiments. In each case the underlying data are similar and are composed of counts of sequencing reads mapped to a large number of features in each sample. Despite this underlying similarity, the data analysis methods used for these experimental designs are all different, and do not translate across experiments. Alternative methods have been developed in the physical and geological sciences that treat similar data as compositions. Compositional data analysis methods transform the data to relative abundances with the result that the analyses are more robust and reproducible.
RESULTS: Data from an in vitro selective growth experiment, an RNA-seq experiment and the Human Microbiome Project 16S rRNA gene abundance dataset were examined by ALDEx2, a compositional data analysis tool that uses Bayesian methods to infer technical and statistical error. The ALDEx2 approach is shown to be suitable for all three types of data: it correctly identifies both the direction and differential abundance of features in the differential growth experiment, it identifies a substantially similar set of differentially expressed genes in the RNA-seq dataset as the leading tools and it identifies as differential the taxa that distinguish the tongue dorsum and buccal mucosa in the Human Microbiome Project dataset. The design of ALDEx2 reduces the number of false positive identifications that result from datasets composed of many features in few samples.
CONCLUSION: Statistical analysis of high-throughput sequencing datasets composed of per feature counts showed that the ALDEx2 R package is a simple and robust tool, which can be applied to RNA-seq, 16S rRNA gene sequencing and differential growth datasets, and by extension to other techniques that use a similar approach.},

Receivers must be able to reduce the babel or noise in these VOCs in order to correctly identify the message. For chemical ecologists faced with vast amounts of data on volatile signatures of plants in different ecological contexts, it is imperative to employ accurate methods of classifying messages, so that suitable bioassays may then be designed to understand message content. We demonstrate the utility of {\textquoteleft}Random Forests{\textquoteright} (RF), a machine-learning algorithm, for the task of classifying volatile signatures and choosing the minimum set of volatiles for accurate discrimination, using data from sympatric Ficus species as a case study. We demonstrate the advantages of RF over conventional classification methods such as principal component analysis (PCA), as well as data-mining algorithms such as support vector machines (SVM), diagonal linear discriminant analysis (DLDA) and k-nearest neighbour (KNN) analysis. We show why a tree-building method such as RF, which is increasingly being used by the bioinformatics, food technology and medical community, is particularly advantageous for the study of plant communication using volatiles, dealing, as it must, with abundant noise.},

The subjects were rescanned under identical conditions when their hallucinations had resolved (mean 19 weeks later). Blood flow was significantly greater during hallucinations than in the non-hallucinating state in Broca's area (mean count density on SPET 1.18 [SD 0.04] vs 1.13 [0.06]; p {\textless} 0.001); flow was also higher during hallucinations in the left anterior cingulate cortex and regions in the left temporal lobe, but these differences did not achieve significance. The increased flow in Broca's area was not accounted for by changes in other clinical variables nor by changes in the dose of neuroleptic drugs.

Several studies have shown that two proteins having a higher topological overlap are more likely to belong to the same functional class than proteins having a lower topological overlap.

	doi = {10.1186/1752-0509-1-54},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is evidence that genes and their protein products are organized into functional modules according to cellular processes and pathways. Gene co-expression networks have been used to describe the relationships between gene transcripts. Ample literature exists on how to detect biologically meaningful modules in networks but there is a need for methods that allow one to study the relationships between modules.
RESULTS: We show that network methods can also be used to describe the relationships between co-expression modules and present the following methodology. First, we describe several methods for detecting modules that are shared by two or more networks (referred to as consensus modules). We represent the gene expression profiles of each module by an eigengene. Second, we propose a method for constructing an eigengene network, where the edges are undirected but maintain information on the sign of the co-expression information. Third, we propose methods for differential eigengene network analysis that allow one to assess the preservation of network properties across different data sets. We illustrate the value of eigengene networks in studying the relationships between consensus modules in human and chimpanzee brains; the relationships between consensus modules in brain, muscle, liver, and adipose mouse tissues; and the relationships between male-female mouse consensus modules and clinical traits. In some applications, we find that module eigengenes can be organized into higher level clusters which we refer to as meta-modules.
CONCLUSION: Eigengene networks can be effective and biologically meaningful tools for studying the relationships between modules of a gene co-expression network. The proposed methods may reveal a higher order organization of the transcriptome.

Although several methods have been developed for survival risk prediction with high-dimensional genomic data, there has been little evaluation of the use of resampling techniques for the assessment of such models. Using real and simulated datasets, we compared several resampling techniques for their ability to estimate the accuracy of risk prediction models. Our study showed that accuracy estimates for popular resampling methods, such as sample splitting and leave-one-out cross validation (Loo CV), have a higher mean square error than for other methods. Moreover, the large variability of the split-sample and Loo CV may make the point estimates of accuracy obtained using these methods unreliable and hence should be interpreted carefully. A k-fold cross-validation with k = 5 or 10 was seen to provide a good balance between bias and variability for a wide range of data settings and should be more widely adopted in practice.},

Consequently loss of normal function of these genes is likely to underlie the susceptibility to developing psychiatric disorders that is conferred by inheritance of the translocation. Additionally, a number of independent genetic studies highlight the region of chromosome 1q containing DISC1 and DISC2 as a likely susceptibility locus for both schizophrenia and affective disorders. These genes are thus implicated in the aetiology of major psychiatric disorders in several populations. Although the function of DISC1 was initially unknown, several recent reports have made significant progress towards understanding its role in the central nervous system. Intriguingly, all data obtained to date point towards an involvement in processes critical to neurodevelopment and function. DISC2 has not been studied in detail, but is likely to modulate DISC1 expression.

METHODS: With real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, we compared the expression of 435 miRNAs and 18 small nucleolar RNAs in postmortem brain tissue samples from individuals with schizophrenia, individuals with bipolar disorder, and psychiatrically healthy control subjects (n = 35 each group). Detailed demographic data, sample selection and storage conditions, and drug and substance exposure histories were available for all subjects. Bayesian model averaging was used to simultaneously assess the impact of these covariates as well as the psychiatric phenotype on miRNA expression profiles.
RESULTS: Of the variables considered, sample storage time, brain pH, alcohol at time of death, and postmortem interval were found to affect the greatest proportion of miRNAs. Of miRNAs analyzed, 19\% exhibited positive evidence of altered expression due to a diagnosis of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Both conditions were associated with reduced miRNA expression levels, with a much more pronounced effect observed for bipolar disorder.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that modest underexpression of several miRNAs might be involved in the complex pathogenesis of major psychosis.},

The number of miRNAs identified is growing rapidly and approximately one-third is expressed in the brain where they have been shown to affect neuronal differentiation, synaptosomal complex localization and synapse plasticity, all functions thought to be disrupted in schizophrenia. Here we investigated the expression of 667 miRNAs (miRBase v.13) in the prefrontal cortex of individuals with schizophrenia (SZ, N = 35) and bipolar disorder (BP, N = 35) using a real-time PCR-based Taqman Low Density Array (TLDA).

At a FDR of 10\%, 22 miRNAs were identified as being differentially expressed between cases and controls, 7 dysregulated in SZ and 15 in BP. Using in silico target gene prediction programs, the 22miRNAs were found to target brain specific genes contained within networks overrepresented for neurodevelopment, behavior, and SZ and BP disease development. In an initial attempt to corroborate some of these predictions, we investigated the extent of correlation between the expressions of hsa-mir-34a, -132 and -212 and their predicted gene targets. mRNA expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (PGD) and metabotropic glutamate receptor 3 (GRM3) was measured in the SMRI sample.

Bayesian methods have been shown to provide accurate transcript abundance estimates compared with competing methods. However, exact Bayesian inference is intractable and approximate methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo and Variational Bayes (VB) are typically used. While providing a high degree of accuracy and modelling flexibility, standard implementations can be prohibitively slow for large datasets and complex transcriptome annotations.
Results: We propose a novel approximate inference scheme based on VB and apply it to an existing model of transcript expression inference from RNA-seq data. Recent advances in VB algorithmics are used to improve the convergence of the algorithm beyond the standard Variational Bayes Expectation Maximization algorithm. We apply our algorithm to simulated and biological datasets, demonstrating a significant increase in speed with only very small loss in accuracy of expression level estimation. We carry out a comparative study against seven popular alternative methods and demonstrate that our new algorithm provides excellent accuracy and inter-replicate consistency while remaining competitive in computation time.
Availability and implementation: The methods were implemented in R and C++, and are available as part of the BitSeq project at github.com/BitSeq. The method is also available through the BitSeq Bioconductor package. The source code to reproduce all simulation results can be accessed via github.com/BitSeq/BitSeqVB\_benchmarking.

Although defective alternative splicing has been linked to SZ, the molecular mechanisms responsible are unknown. Additionally, there is limited understanding of the early transcriptomic responses to neuronal activation. Here, we profile these transcriptomic responses and show that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are dynamically regulated by neuronal activation, including acute downregulation of the lncRNA Gomafu, previously implicated in brain and retinal development. Moreover, we demonstrate that Gomafu binds directly to the splicing factors QKI and SRSF1 (serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 1) and dysregulation of Gomafu leads to alternative splicing patterns that resemble those observed in SZ for the archetypal SZ-associated genes DISC1 and ERBB4. Finally, we show that Gomafu is downregulated in post-mortem cortical gray matter from the superior temporal gyrus in SZ. These results functionally link activity-regulated lncRNAs and alternative splicing in neuronal function and suggest that their dysregulation may contribute to neurological disorders.},

	abstract = {A balanced (1;11)(q42.1;q14.3) translocation segregates with schizophrenia and related psychiatric disorders in a large Scottish family (maximum LOD = 6.0). We hypothesize that the translocation is the causative event and that it directly disrupts gene function. We previously reported a dearth of genes in the breakpoint region of chromosome 11 and it is therefore unlikely that the expression of any genes on this chromosome has been affected by the translocation. By contrast, the corresponding region on chromosome 1 is gene dense and, not one, but two novel genes are directly disrupted by the translocation. These genes have been provisionally named Disrupted-In-Schizophrenia 1 and 2 ( DISC1 and DISC2 ). DISC1 encodes a large protein with no significant sequence homology to other known proteins. It is predicted to consist of a globular N-terminal domain(s) and helical C-terminal domain which has the potential to form a coiled-coil by interaction with another, as yet, unidentified protein(s). Similar structures are thought to be present in a variety of unrelated proteins that are known to function in the nervous system. The putative structure of the protein encoded by DISC1 is therefore compatible with a role in the nervous system. DISC2 apparently specifies a non-coding RNA molecule that is antisense to DISC1, an arrangement that has been observed at other loci where it is thought that the antisense RNA is involved in regulating expression of the sense gene. Altogether, these observations indicate that DISC1 and DISC2 should be considered formal candidate genes for susceptibility to psychiatric illness.},

	abstract = {RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) is a powerful technique to investigate the complexity of gene expression in the human brain. We used RNA-seq to survey the brain transcriptome in high-quality postmortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex from 11 individuals diagnosed with bipolar disorder (BD) and from 11 age- and gender-matched controls. Deep sequencing was performed, with over 350 million reads per specimen. At a false discovery rate of {\textless}5\%, we detected five differentially expressed (DE) genes and 12 DE transcripts, most of which have not been previously implicated in BD. Among these, Prominin 1/CD133 and ATP-binding cassette-sub-family G-member2 (ABCG2) have important roles in neuroplasticity. We also show for the first time differential expression of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in BD. DE transcripts include those of serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 5 (SRSF5) and regulatory factor X4 (RFX4), which along with lncRNAs have a role in mammalian circadian rhythms. The DE genes were significantly enriched for several Gene Ontology categories. Of these, genes involved with GTPase binding were also enriched for BD-associated SNPs from previous genome-wide association studies, suggesting that differential expression of these genes is not simply a consequence of BD or its treatment. Many of these findings were replicated by microarray in an independent sample of 60 cases and controls. These results highlight common pathways for inherited and non-inherited influences on disease risk that may constitute good targets for novel therapies.},

A large proportion of this variance is still not accounted for, but evidence so far suggests the involvement of genetic factors. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) with concentration dose ratio (CDR) as sub-phenotype to assess metabolism rate of psychotropic drugs in a homogenous Norwegian sample of 1334 individuals diagnosed with a severe mental disorder. The GWAS revealed one genome-wide significant marker (rs16935279, p-value=3.95{\texttimes}10(-10), pperm=7.5{\texttimes}10(-4)) located in an intronic region of the lncRNA LOC100505718. Carriers of the minor allele have a lower metabolism rate of antiepileptic drugs compared to major allele carriers. In addition, several nominally significant associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and CDR for antipsychotic, antidepressant and antiepileptic drugs were disclosed. We consider standardised CDR to be a useful measure of the metabolism rate of a drug. The present findings indicate that common gene variants could affect the metabolism of psychotropic drugs. This warrants further investigations into the functional mechanisms involved as it may lead to identification of predictive markers as well as novel drug targets.},

After replication in an independent cohort, we linked this genetic variant-associated with reduced SNX7 expression-to positive psychotic symptoms and executive function deficits in bipolar disorder. A series of post-mortem brain tissue and in vitro experiments suggested SNX7 downregulation to result in a caspase-8-driven activation of interleukin-1$\beta$ and a subsequent induction of the brain kynurenine pathway.

	abstract = {BackgroundProtein encoding genes have long been the major targets for research in schizophrenia genetics. However, with the identification of regulatory microRNAs (miRNAs) as important in brain development and function, miRNAs genes have emerged as candidates for schizophrenia-associated genetic factors. Indeed, the growing understanding of the regulatory properties and pleiotropic effects that miRNA have on molecular and cellular mechanisms, suggests that alterations in the interactions between miRNAs and their mRNA targets may contribute to phenotypic variation.Methodology/Principal FindingsWe have studied the association between schizophrenia and genetic variants of miRNA genes associated with brain-expression using a case-control study design on three Scandinavian samples. Eighteen known SNPs within or near brain-expressed miRNAs in three samples (Danish, Swedish and Norwegian: 420/163/257 schizophrenia patients and 1006/177/293 control subjects), were analyzed. Subsequently, joint analysis of the three samples was performed on SNPs showing marginal association. Two SNPs rs17578796 and rs1700 in hsa-mir-206 (mir-206) and hsa-mit-198 (mir-198) showed nominal significant allelic association to schizophrenia in the Danish and Norwegian sample respectively (P?=?0.0021 \& p?=?0.038), of which only rs17578796 was significant in the joint sample. In-silico analysis revealed that 8 of the 15 genes predicted to be regulated by both mir-206 and mir-198, are transcriptional targets or interaction partners of the JUN, ATF2 and TAF1 connected in a tight network. JUN and two of the miRNA targets (CCND2 and PTPN1) in the network have previously been associated with schizophrenia.Conclusions/SignificanceWe found nominal association between brain-expressed miRNAs and schizophrenia for rs17578796 and rs1700 located in mir-206 and mir-198 respectively. These two miRNAs have a surprising large number (15) of targets in common, eight of which are also connected by the same transcription factors.},

Differentiating human neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provide an ideal system for RNA-Seq since defective neurogenesis caused by abnormalities in transcription factors, DNA methylation, and chromatin modifiers lie at the heart of some neuropsychiatric disorders. As a preliminary step towards applying next generation sequencing using neurons derived from patient-specific iPSCs, we have carried out an RNA-Seq analysis on control human neurons. Dramatic changes in the expression of coding genes, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), pseudogenes, and splice isoforms were seen during the transition from pluripotent stem cells to early differentiating neurons. A number of genes that undergo radical changes in expression during this transition include candidates for schizophrenia (SZ), bipolar disorder (BD) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) that function as transcription factors and chromatin modifiers, such as POU3F2 and ZNF804A, and genes coding for cell adhesion proteins implicated in these conditions including NRXN1 and NLGN1. In addition, a number of novel lncRNAs were found to undergo dramatic changes in expression, one of which is HOTAIRM1, a regulator of several HOXA genes during myelopoiesis. The increase we observed in differentiating neurons suggests a role in neurogenesis as well. Finally, several lncRNAs that map near SNPs associated with SZ in genome wide association studies also increase during neuronal differentiation, suggesting that these novel transcripts may be abnormally regulated in a subgroup of patients.},

In this review, we discuss several examples of known RNA mechanisms for the regulation of protein synthesis. We then discuss the possibility that ncRNA regulation of schizophrenia risk genes may underlie the diverse findings of genetic linkage studies including that protein-altering gene polymorphisms are not generally found in schizophrenia. Thus, inadequate or mistimed expression of a functional protein may occur either due to mutation or other dysfunction of the DNA coding base pair sequence, leading to a dysfunctional protein, or due to post-transcriptional events such as abnormal ncRNA regulation of a normal gene. One or more 'schizophrenia disease genes' may turn out to include abnormal transcriptional units that code for RNA regulators of protein coding gene expression or to be proximal to such units, rather than to be abnormalities in the protein coding gene itself. Understanding the genetics of schizophrenia and other complex neuropsychiatric disorders might very well include consideration of RNA and epigenetic regulation of protein expression in addition to polymorphisms of the protein coding gene.},

Both techniques showed profound changes in tissue from low-cumulative-medication SCZ subjects, but few changes in tissue from medium-cumulative-medication subjects. Protein expression changes were validated by Western blot and investigated further in a third group of subjects who were subjected to high-cumulative-medication over the course of their lifetime. Furthermore, key protein expression and metabolite level changes correlated significantly with lifetime antipsychotic dose. This suggests that the detected changes are present before antipsychotic therapy and, moreover, may be normalized with treatment. Overall, our analyses revealed novel protein and metabolite changes in low-cumulative-medication subjects associated with synaptogenesis, neuritic dynamics, presynaptic vesicle cycling, amino acid and glutamine metabolism, and energy buffering systems. Most of these markers were altered specifically in SCZ as determined by analysis of the same brain region from BPD patients.},

Cross-validation (CV) is an effective method for estimating the prediction error of a classifier. Some recent articles have proposed methods for optimizing classifiers by choosing classifier parameter values that minimize the CV error estimate. We have evaluated the validity of using the CV error estimate of the optimized classifier as an estimate of the true error expected on independent data.

Results
We used CV to optimize the classification parameters for two kinds of classifiers; Shrunken Centroids and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Random training datasets were created, with no difference in the distribution of the features between the two classes. Using these "null" datasets, we selected classifier parameter values that minimized the CV error estimate. 10-fold CV was used for Shrunken Centroids while Leave-One-Out-CV (LOOCV) was used for the SVM. Independent test data was created to estimate the true error. With "null" and "non null" (with differential expression between the classes) data, we also tested a nested CV procedure, where an inner CV loop is used to perform the tuning of the parameters while an outer CV is used to compute an estimate of the error., The CV error estimate for the classifier with the optimal parameters was found to be a substantially biased estimate of the true error that the classifier would incur on independent data. Even though there is no real difference between the two classes for the "null" datasets, the CV error estimate for the Shrunken Centroid with the optimal parameters was less than 30\% on 18.5\% of simulated training data-sets. For SVM with optimal parameters the estimated error rate was less than 30\% on 38\% of "null" data-sets. Performance of the optimized classifiers on the independent test set was no better than chance., The nested CV procedure reduces the bias considerably and gives an estimate of the error that is very close to that obtained on the independent testing set for both Shrunken Centroids and SVM classifiers for "null" and "non-null" data distributions.

Conclusion
We show that using CV to compute an error estimate for a classifier that has itself been tuned using CV gives a significantly biased estimate of the true error. Proper use of CV for estimating true error of a classifier developed using a well defined algorithm requires that all steps of the algorithm, including classifier parameter tuning, be repeated in each CV loop. A nested CV procedure provides an almost unbiased estimate of the true error.},

This paper is devoted to reviewing the most up-to-date feature selection methods developed in this field and the microarray databases most frequently used in the literature. We also make the interested reader aware of the problematic of data characteristics in this domain, such as the imbalance of the data, their complexity, or the so-called dataset shift. Finally, an experimental evaluation on the most representative datasets using well-known feature selection methods is presented, bearing in mind that the aim is not to provide the best feature selection method, but to facilitate their comparative study by the research community.},

	abstract = {In the area of bioinformatics, the identification of gene subsets responsible for classifying available disease samples to two or more of its variants is an important task. Such problems have been solved in the past by means of unsupervised learning methods (hierarchical clustering, self-organizing maps, k-mean clustering, etc.) and supervised learning methods (weighted voting approach, k-nearest neighbor method, support vector machine method, etc.). Such problems can also be posed as optimization problems of minimizing gene subset size to achieve reliable and accurate classification. The main difficulties in solving the resulting optimization problem are the availability of only a few samples compared to the number of genes in the samples and the exorbitantly large search space of solutions. Although there exist a few applications of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) for this task, here we treat the problem as a multiobjective optimization problem of minimizing the gene subset size and minimizing the number of misclassified samples. Moreover, for a more reliable classification, we consider multiple training sets in evaluating a classifier. Contrary to the past studies, the use of a multiobjective EA (NSGA-II) has enabled us to discover a smaller gene subset size (such as four or five) to correctly classify 100\% or near 100\% samples for three cancer samples (Leukemia, Lymphoma, and Colon). We have also extended the NSGA-II to obtain multiple non-dominated solutions discovering as much as 352 different three-gene combinations providing a 100\% correct classification to the Leukemia data. In order to have further confidence in the identification task, we have also introduced a prediction strength threshold for determining a sample's belonging to one class or the other. All simulation results show consistent gene subset identifications on three disease samples and exhibit the flexibilities and efficacies in using a multiobjective EA for the gene subset identification task.},

Because these new micro-array devices generate bewildering amounts of raw data, new analytical methods must be developed to sort out whether cancer tissues have distinctive signatures of gene expression over normal tissues or other types of cancer tissues. In this paper, we address the problem of selection of a small subset of genes from broad patterns of gene expression data, recorded on DNA micro-arrays. Using available training examples from cancer and normal patients, we build a classifier suitable for genetic diagnosis, as well as drug discovery. Previous attempts to address this problem select genes with correlation techniques. We propose a new method of gene selection utilizing Support Vector Machine methods based on Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE). We demonstrate experimentally that the genes selected by our techniques yield better classification performance and are biologically relevant to cancer. In contrast with the baseline method, our method eliminates gene redundancy automatically and yields better and more compact gene subsets. In patients with leukemia our method discovered 2 genes that yield zero leave-one-out error, while 64 genes are necessary for the baseline method to get the best result (one leave-one-out error). In the colon cancer database, using only 4 genes our method is 98\% accurate, while the baseline method is only 86\% accurate.},

	abstract = {Despite large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS), the underlying genes for schizophrenia are largely unknown. Additional approaches are therefore required to identify the genetic background of this disorder. Here we report findings from a large gene expression study in peripheral blood of schizophrenia patients and controls. We applied a systems biology approach to genome-wide expression data from whole blood of 92 medicated and 29 antipsychotic-free schizophrenia patients and 118 healthy controls. We show that gene expression profiling in whole blood can identify twelve large gene co-expression modules associated with schizophrenia. Several of these disease related modules are likely to reflect expression changes due to antipsychotic medication. However, two of the disease modules could be replicated in an independent second data set involving antipsychotic-free patients and controls. One of these robustly defined disease modules is significantly enriched with brain-expressed genes and with genetic variants that were implicated in a GWAS study, which could imply a causal role in schizophrenia etiology. The most highly connected intramodular hub gene in this module (ABCF1), is located in, and regulated by the major histocompatibility (MHC) complex, which is intriguing in light of the fact that common allelic variants from the MHC region have been implicated in schizophrenia. This suggests that the MHC increases schizophrenia susceptibility via altered gene expression of regulatory genes in this network.},

This emerging technology represents a rigorous and convenient alternative to traditional tissue biopsy-derived RNA, as it allows for larger sample sizes, better standardization of technical procedures, and the ability to non-invasively profile human subjects. In the present pilot study, we have collected RNA from blood of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder (BPD), as well as normal control subjects. Using microarray analysis, we found that each disease state exhibited a unique expressed genome signature, allowing us to discriminate between the schizophrenia, BPD, and control groups. In addition, we validated changes in several potential biomarker genes for schizophrenia and BPD by RT-PCR, and some of these were found to code to chromosomal loci previously linked to schizophrenia. Linear and non-linear combinations of eight putative biomarker genes (APOBEC3B, ADSS, ATM, CLC, CTBP1, DATF1, CXCL1, and S100A9) were able to discriminate between schizophrenia, BPD, and control samples, with an overall accuracy of 95\%-97\% as indicated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. We therefore propose that blood cell-derived RNA may have significant value for performing diagnostic functions and identifying disease biomarkers in schizophrenia and BPD.},

Specifically, we reviewed seven studies comparing patterns of DNA methylation (i.e., an aspect of the epigenome), eight articles comparing patterns of gene expression (i.e., the transcriptome), and three articles comparing patterns of protein expression (i.e., the proteome). Our review of the epigenomic literature suggests that CpG-island methylation levels are generally highly correlated (r = 0.90) between blood and brain. Our review of transcriptomic studies suggests that between 35\% and 80\% of known transcripts are present in both brain and blood tissue samples; estimates of cross-tissue correlation in expression levels were found to range from 0.25 to 0.64, with stronger correlations observed among particular subsets of genes. Relative to the epigenome and transcriptome, the proteome has not been as fully compared between brain and blood samples, highlighting an important area for future work as whole-proteome profiling methods mature. Beyond reviewing the relevant studies, we discuss some of the assumptions, methodological issues, and gaps in knowledge that should be addressed in order to better understand how the multiple "-omes" of the brain are reflected in the peripheral blood. A better understanding of these relationships is a critical precursor to the validation of biomarkers for brain disorders.},

The molecular multigene marker here identified is associated with risk of PD in 66 samples of the training set comprising healthy and disease controls [third tertile cross-validated odds ratio of 5.7 (P for trend 0.005)]. It is further validated in 39 independent test samples [third tertile odds ratio of 5.1 (P for trend 0.04)]. Insights into disease-linked processes detectable in peripheral blood are offered by 22 unique genes differentially expressed in patients with PD versus healthy individuals. These include the co-chaperone ST13, which stabilizes heat-shock protein 70, a modifier of alpha-synuclein misfolding and toxicity. ST13 messenger RNA copies are lower in patients with PD (mean +/- SE 0.59 +/- 0.05) than in controls (0.96 +/- 0.09) (P = 0.002) in two independent populations.

Gene expression in 40 tumor and 22 normal colon tissue samples was analyzed with an Affymetrix oligonucleotide array complementary to more than 6,500 human genes. An efficient two-way clustering algorithm was applied to both the genes and the tissues, revealing broad coherent patterns that suggest a high degree of organization underlying gene expression in these tissues. Coregulated families of genes clustered together, as demonstrated for the ribosomal proteins. Clustering also separated cancerous from noncancerous tissue and cell lines from in vivo tissues on the basis of subtle distributed patterns of genes even when expression of individual genes varied only slightly between the tissues. Two-way clustering thus may be of use both in classifying genes into functional groups and in classifying tissues based on gene expression.},

	abstract = {There are currently no biological tests that differentiate patients with bipolar disorder (BPD) from healthy controls. While there is evidence that peripheral gene expression differences between patients and controls can be utilized as biomarkers for psychiatric illness, it is unclear whether current use or residual effects of antipsychotic and mood stabilizer medication drives much of the differential transcription. We therefore tested whether expression changes in first-episode, never-medicated BPD patients, can contribute to a biological classifier that is less influenced by medication and could potentially form a practicable biomarker assay for BPD. We employed microarray technology to measure global leukocyte gene expression in first-episode (n=3) and currently medicated BPD patients (n=26), and matched healthy controls (n=25). Following an initial feature selection of the microarray data, we developed a cross-validated 10-gene model that was able to correctly predict the diagnostic group of the training sample (26 medicated patients and 12 controls), with 89\% sensitivity and 75\% specificity (p{\textless}0.001). The 10-gene predictor was further explored via testing on an independent cohort consisting of three pairs of monozygotic twins discordant for BPD, plus the original enrichment sample cohort (the three never-medicated BPD patients and 13 matched control subjects), and a sample of experimental replicates (n=34). 83\% of the independent test sample was correctly predicted, with a sensitivity of 67\% and specificity of 100\% (although this result did not reach statistical significance). Additionally, 88\% of sample diagnostic classes were classified correctly for both the enrichment (p=0.015) and the replicate samples (p{\textless}0.001). We have developed a peripheral gene expression biomarker profile, that can classify healthy controls from patients with BPD receiving antipsychotic or mood stabilizing medication, which has both high sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, assay of three first-episode patients who had never received such medications, to first enrich the expression dataset for disease-related genes independent of medication effects, and then to test the 10-gene predictor, validates the peripheral biomarker approach for BPD.},

However, there is little work done on its overfitting analysis to avoid deceptive diagnostic results. In this work, we investigate the important problem and prove that a SVM classifier would inevitably encounter overfitting for gene expression array data under a standard Gaussian kernel due to the built-in large data variations from DNA amplification mechanism in the transcriptional profiling. We have found that SVM demonstrates its own special overfitting characteristics on array data, in addition to showing that feature selection algorithms may not contribute to overcoming overfitting, and discussing overfitting in biomarker discovery algorithm.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Numerous feature selection methods have been applied to the identification of differentially expressed genes in microarray data. These include simple fold change, classical t-statistic and moderated t-statistics. Even though these methods return gene lists that are often dissimilar, few direct comparisons of these exist. We present an empirical study in which we compare some of the most commonly used feature selection methods. We apply these to 9 publicly available datasets, and compare, both the gene lists produced and how these perform in class prediction of test datasets.
RESULTS: In this study, we compared the efficiency of the feature selection methods; significance analysis of microarrays (SAM), analysis of variance (ANOVA), empirical bayes t-statistic, template matching, maxT, between group analysis (BGA), Area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the Welch t-statistic, fold change, rank products, and sets of randomly selected genes. In each case these methods were applied to 9 different binary (two class) microarray datasets. Firstly we found little agreement in gene lists produced by the different methods. Only 8 to 21\% of genes were in common across all 10 feature selection methods. Secondly, we evaluated the class prediction efficiency of each gene list in training and test cross-validation using four supervised classifiers.
CONCLUSION: We report that the choice of feature selection method, the number of genes in the genelist, the number of cases (samples) and the noise in the dataset, substantially influence classification success. Recommendations are made for choice of feature selection. Area under a ROC curve performed well with datasets that had low levels of noise and large sample size. Rank products performs well when datasets had low numbers of samples or high levels of noise. The Empirical bayes t-statistic performed well across a range of sample sizes.},

RESULTS: In this study, we compared the efficiency of the classification methods including; SVM, RBF Neural Nets, MLP Neural Nets, Bayesian, Decision Tree and Random Forrest methods. The v-fold cross validation was used to calculate the accuracy of the classifiers. Some of the common clustering methods including K-means, DBC, and EM clustering were applied to the datasets and the efficiency of these methods have been analysed. Further the efficiency of the feature selection methods including support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE), Chi Squared, and CSF were compared. In each case these methods were applied to eight different binary (two class) microarray datasets. We evaluated the class prediction efficiency of each gene list in training and test cross-validation using supervised classifiers.

	abstract = {Gene expression array technology has reached the stage of being routinely used to study clinical samples in search of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Due to the nature of array experiments, which examine the expression of tens of thousands of genes simultaneously, the number of null hypotheses is large. Hence, multiple testing correction is often necessary to control the number of false positives. However, multiple testing correction can lead to low statistical power in detecting genes that are truly differentially expressed. Filtering out non-informative genes allows for reduction in the number of null hypotheses. While several filtering methods have been suggested, the appropriate way to perform filtering is still debatable. We propose a new filtering strategy for Affymetrix GeneChips{\textregistered}, based on principal component analysis of probe-level gene expression data. Using a wholly defined spike-in data set and one from a diabetes study, we show that filtering by the proportion of variation accounted for by the first principal component (PVAC) provides increased sensitivity in detecting truly differentially expressed genes while controlling false discoveries. We demonstrate that PVAC exhibits equal or better performance than several widely used filtering methods. Furthermore, a data-driven approach that guides the selection of the filtering threshold value is also proposed.},

Accurate diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) at an early stage, and correct differentiation between Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is important for optimum treatment and prognosis. We present here the first characterization of fecal extracts obtained from patients with CD and UC by employing a noninvasive metabonomics approach, which combines high resolution 1H NMR spectroscopy and multivariate pattern recognition techniques. The fecal extracts of both CD and UC patients were characterized by reduced levels of butyrate, acetate, methylamine, and trimethylamine in comparison with a control population, suggesting changes in the gut microbial community. Also, elevated quantities of amino acids were present in the feces from both disease groups, implying malabsorption caused by the inflammatory disease or an element of protein losing enteropathy. Metabolic differences in fecal profiles were more marked in the CD group in comparison with the control group, indicating that the inflammation caused by CD is more extensive in comparison with UC and involves the whole intestine. Furthermore, glycerol resonances were a dominant feature of fecal spectra from patients with CD but were present in much lower intensity in the control and UC groups. This work illustrates the potential of metabonomics to generate novel noninvasive diagnostics for gastrointestinal diseases and may further our understanding of disease mechanisms.

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Large-scale gene expression profiling has been widely used to characterize cellular states in response to various disease conditions, genetic perturbations, etc. Although the cost of whole-genome expression profiles has been dropping steadily, generating a compendium of expression profiling over thousands of samples is still very expensive. Recognizing that gene expressions are often highly correlated, researchers from the NIH LINCS program have developed a cost-effective strategy of profiling only \~{}1000 carefully selected landmark genes and relying on computational methods to infer the expression of remaining target genes. However, the computational approach adopted by the LINCS program is currently based on linear regression (LR), limiting its accuracy since it does not capture complex nonlinear relationship between expressions of genes.
RESULTS: We present a deep learning method (abbreviated as D-GEX) to infer the expression of target genes from the expression of landmark genes. We used the microarray-based Gene Expression Omnibus dataset, consisting of 111K expression profiles, to train our model and compare its performance to those from other methods. In terms of mean absolute error averaged across all genes, deep learning significantly outperforms LR with 15.33\% relative improvement. A gene-wise comparative analysis shows that deep learning achieves lower error than LR in 99.97\% of the target genes. We also tested the performance of our learned model on an independent RNA-Seq-based GTEx dataset, which consists of 2921 expression profiles. Deep learning still outperforms LR with 6.57\% relative improvement, and achieves lower error in 81.31\% of the target genes.

The glycone parts of these compounds are mostly oligosaccharides, arranged either in a linear or branched fashion, attached to hydroxyl groups through an acetal linkage (2, 3).

Bile salt hydrolysis and hydroxy group dehydrogenation reactions are carried out by a broad spectrum of intestinal anaerobic bacteria, whereas bile acid 7-dehydroxylation appears restricted to a limited number of intestinal anaerobes representing a small fraction of the total colonic flora. Microbial enzymes modifying bile salts differ between species with respect to pH optima, enzyme kinetics, substrate specificity, cellular location, and possibly physiological function. Crystallization, site-directed mutagenesis, and comparisons of protein secondary structure have provided insight into the mechanisms of several bile acid-biotransforming enzymatic reactions. Molecular cloning of genes encoding bile salt-modifying enzymes has facilitated the understanding of the genetic organization of these pathways and is a means of developing probes for the detection of bile salt-modifying bacteria. The potential exists for altering the bile acid pool by targeting key enzymes in the 7$\alpha$/$\beta$-dehydroxylation pathway through the development of pharmaceuticals or sequestering bile acids biologically in probiotic bacteria, which may result in their effective removal from the host after excretion.},

Among these advances include sophisticated high-throughput assays that measure the relative abundance of microorganisms, RNA molecules, and metabolites. While these data are most often collected to gain new insights into biological systems, they can also be used as biomarkers to create clinically useful diagnostic classifiers. How best to classify high-dimensional {\textquotedblleft}-omics{\textquotedblright} data remains an area of active research. However, few explicitly model the relative nature of these data, and instead rely on cumbersome normalizations which often invoke untestable assumptions. This report (a) emphasizes the relative nature of health biomarkers, (b) discusses the literature surrounding the classification of relative data, and (c) benchmarks how different transformations perform across multiple biomarker types. In doing so, this report explores how one could use balances to engineer features prior to classification, and proposes a simple procedure, called discriminative balance analysis, to select discriminative 2- and 3-part balances.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Sequencing reads derived from sequins align exclusively to an artificial in silico reference chromosome, rather than the human reference genome, which allows them them to be partitioned for parallel analysis. Here we use this approach to represent common and clinically relevant genetic variation, ranging from single nucleotide variants to large structural rearrangements and copy-number variation. We validate the design and performance of sequin standards by comparison to examples in the NA12878 reference genome, and we demonstrate their utility during the detection and quantification of variants.

We have developed a set of spike-in RNA standards, termed 'sequins' (sequencing spike-ins), that represent full-length spliced mRNA isoforms. Sequins have an entirely artificial sequence with no homology to natural reference genomes, but they align to gene loci encoded on an artificial in silico chromosome. The combination of multiple sequins across a range of concentrations emulates alternative splicing and differential gene expression, and it provides scaling factors for normalization between samples. We demonstrate the use of sequins in RNA-seq experiments to measure sample-specific biases and determine the limits of reliable transcript assembly and quantification in accompanying human RNA samples. In addition, we have designed a complementary set of sequins that represent fusion genes arising from rearrangements of the in silico chromosome to aid in cancer diagnosis.

Control materials will also play a major role in the assessment, development, and selection of appropriate alignment and variant calling pipelines. We report an approach to provide effective multianalyte controls for next-generation sequencing assays, referred to as the control plasmid spiked-in genome (CPSG). Control plasmids that contain approximately 1000 bases of human genomic sequence with a specific mutation of interest positioned near the middle of the insert and a nearby 6-bp molecular barcode were synthesized, linearized, quantitated, and spiked into genomic DNA derived from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded-prepared hapmap cell lines at defined copy number ratios. Serial titration experiments demonstrated the CPSGs performed with similar efficiency of variant detection as formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded cell line genomic DNA. Repetitive analyses of one lot of CPSGs 90 times during 18 months revealed that the reagents were stable with consistent detection of each of the plasmids at similar variant allele frequencies. CPSGs are designed to work across most next-generation sequencing methods, platforms, and data analysis pipelines. CPSGs are robust controls and can be used to evaluate the performance of different next-generation sequencing diagnostic assays,~assess data analysis pipelines, and ensure robust assay performance metrics.},

Reference RNA samples were spiked with SIRV mixes, sequenced, and exemplarily four data evaluation pipelines were challenged to account for biases introduced by the RNA-Seq workflow. The deviations of the respective isoform quantifications from the known inputs allow to determine the comparability of sequencing experiments and to extrapolate to which degree alterations in an RNA-Seq workflow affect gene expression measurements.

Aitchison in the eighties have proven successful in solving a number of applied problems. The algebraic{\textendash}geometric structure of the sample space, tailored to those principles, was developed at the beginning of the millennium. Two main ideas completed the J. Aitchison{\textquoteright}s seminal work: the conception of compositions as equivalence classes of proportional vectors, and their representation in the simplex endowed with an interpretable Euclidean structure. These achievements allowed the representation of compositions in meaningful coordinates (preferably Cartesian), as well as orthogonal projections compatible with the Aitchison distance introduced two decades before. These ideas and concepts are reviewed up to the normal distribution on the simplex and the associated central limit theorem. Exploratory tools, specifically designed for CoDa, are also reviewed. To illustrate the adequacy and interpretability of the sample space structure, a new inequality index, based on the Aitchison norm, is proposed. Most concepts are illustrated with an example of mean household gross income per capita in Spain.},

	abstract = {It was already described that genetic inhibition of NUPR1 induces tumor growth arrest. In this paper we studied the metabolism changes after NUPR1 downregulation in pancreatic cancer cells, which results in a significant decrease of OXPHOS activity with a concomitant lower ATP production which precedes the necrotic cell death. We demonstrated that NUPR1 downregulation induces a mitochondrial failure with a loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential, a strong increase in ROS production and a concomitant relocalization of mitochondria to the vicinity of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In addition, the transcriptomic analysis of NUPR1-deficient cells shows a decrease in the expression of some ER stress response-associated genes. Indeed, in ER stressors-treated cells with thapsigargin, brefeldin A or tunicamycin, a greater increase in necrosis and decrease of ATP content was observed in NUPR1-defficent cells. Finally, in vivo experiments, using acute pancreatitis which induces ER stress as well as NUPR1 activation, we observed that NUPR1 expression protects acinar cells from necrosis in mice. Importantly, we also report that the cell death observed after knocking-down NUPR1 expression is completely reversed by incubation with Necrostatin-1, but not by inhibiting caspase activity with Z-VAD-FMK. Altogether, these data enable us to describe a model in which inactivation of NUPR1 in pancreatic cancer cells results in an ER stress that induces a mitochondrial malfunction, a deficient ATP production and, as consequence, the cell death mediated by a programmed necrosis.},

Using novel tools to critique model validity and reliability we performed a systematic review to identify all original publications describing the derivation of PDX models of colon, prostate, breast and lung cancer. Validity was defined as the ability to recapitulate the disease of interest. The study protocol was registered with the Collaborative Approach to Meta-Analysis and Review of Animal Data from Experimental Studies (CAMARADES). Searches were performed in Embase, MEDLINE and Pubmed up to July 2017. A narrative data synthesis was performed. We identified 105 studies of model validations; 29 for breast, 29 for colon, 25 for lung, 23 for prostate and 4 for multiple tissues. 133 studies were excluded because they did not perform any validation experiments despite deriving a PDX. Only one study reported following the ARRIVE guidelines; developed to improve the standard of reporting for animal experimentation. Remarkably, half of all breast (52\%) and prostate (50\%) studies were judged to have high concern, in contrast to 16\% of colon and 28\% of lung studies. The validation criteria that most commonly failed (evidence to the contrary) were: tissue of origin not proven and histology of the xenograft not comparable to the parental tumour. Overall, most studies were categorized as unclear because one or more validation conditions were not reported, or researchers failed to provide data for a proportion of their models. For example, failure to demonstrate tissue of origin, response to standard of care agents and to exclude development of lymphoma. Validation tools have the potential to improve reproducibility, reduce waste in research and increase the success of translational studies.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are playing important roles in cancer progression and metastasis. Recent studies have demonstrated that the lncRNA, nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (NEAT1), was aberrantly up-regulated in various types of cancers and was reported to be associated with unfavorable prognosis in cancer patients. This study examined the relationship between NEAT1 and relevant clinical outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 1354 patients from 11 eligible studies were included in the meta-analysis. The results showed that high expression level of NEAT1 was significantly associated with shorter overall survival in cancer patients (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.53, 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 1.36-1.71); in the subgroup analysis, the positive association was also found in patients with hepato-gastroenterol cancers (HR = 1.79, 95\% CI = 1.48-2.16), non-small cell lung cancer (HR = 1.35, 95\% CI = 1.04-1.76), ovarian cancer (HR = 1.41, 95\% CI = 1.11-1.79) and other types of cancers (HR = 1.42, 95\% CI = 1.11-1.81). The clinicopathological parameters analysis further showed that increased expression level of NEAT1 was positively correlated with larger tumor size (odds ratio (OR) = 1.74, 95\% CI = 1.26-2.41), lymph node metastasis (OR = 2.29, 95\% CI = 1.71-3.06), advanced TNM stage (OR = 3.60, 95\% CI = 2.27-5.72), poor tumor differentiation (OR = 2.16, 95\% CI = 1.58-2.93), distant metastasis (OR = 3.51, 95\% CI = 1.75-7.01), and invasion depth (OR = 1.94, 95\% CI = 1.36-2.75).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive search was performed in Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science and CNKI databases, and eligible studies were included based on defined exclusion and inclusion criteria to perform meta-analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: The meta-analysis results from present study suggested that increased expression level of NEAT1 was associated with unfavorable prognosis and may serve as a predictive factor for clinicopathological features in various cancers.},

We have characterized one aspect of aneuploidy: the gain of extra chromosomes. We created a collection of haploid yeast strains that each bear an extra copy of one or more of almost all of the yeast chromosomes. Their characterization revealed that aneuploid strains share a number of phenotypes, including defects in cell cycle progression, increased glucose uptake, and increased sensitivity to conditions interfering with protein synthesis and protein folding. These phenotypes were observed only in strains carrying additional yeast genes, which indicates that they reflect the consequences of additional protein production as well as the resulting imbalances in cellular protein composition. We conclude that aneuploidy causes not only a proliferative disadvantage but also a set of phenotypes that is independent of the identity of the individual extra chromosomes.
Yeast cells containing any extra chromosome all exhibit a similar phenotype despite the presence of supernumerary genes.

The major challenge in this context is the combinatorial explosion of the number of set intersections if the number of sets exceeds a trivial threshold. In this paper we introduce UpSet, a novel visualization technique for the quantitative analysis of sets, their intersections, and aggregates of intersections. UpSet is focused on creating task-driven aggregates, communicating the size and properties of aggregates and intersections, and a duality between the visualization of the elements in a dataset and their set membership. UpSet visualizes set intersections in a matrix layout and introduces aggregates based on groupings and queries. The matrix layout enables the effective representation of associated data, such as the number of elements in the aggregates and intersections, as well as additional summary statistics derived from subset or element attributes. Sorting according to various measures enables a task-driven analysis of relevant intersections and aggregates. The elements represented in the sets and their associated attributes are visualized in a separate view. Queries based on containment in specific intersections, aggregates or driven by attribute filters are propagated between both views. We also introduce several advanced visual encodings and interaction methods to overcome the problems of varying scales and to address scalability. UpSet is web-based and open source. We demonstrate its general utility in multiple use cases from various domains.},

The high variability of scRNA-seq data raises computational challenges in data analysis. Currently, although an increasing number of bioinformatics methods are proposed for analyzing and interpreting scRNA-seq data, novel algorithms are required to ensure the accuracy and reproducibility of results. In this review, we provide an overview of currently available single-cell isolation protocols and scRNA-seq technologies, and discuss the methods for diverse scRNA-seq data analyses including quality control, read mapping, gene expression quantification, batch effect correction, normalization, imputation, dimensionality reduction, feature selection, cell clustering, trajectory inference, differential expression calling, alternative splicing, allelic expression and gene regulatory network reconstruction.

However, it has proved difficult to accurately predict survival outcomes and treatment responses, despite advancements in the field. In this manuscript, we show how transforming gene expression data into a set of personalized (sample-specific) networks can allow us to harness existing graph-based methods to improve classifier performance. Existing approaches to personalized gene networks, based on protein-protein interactions (PPI) or population-level models, all have the limitation that they depend on other samples in the data and must get re-computed whenever a new sample is introduced. Here, we propose a novel method, called Personalized Annotation-based Networks (PAN), that avoids this limitation by using curated annotation databases to transform gene expression data into a graph. These databases organize genes into overlapping gene sets, called annotations, that we use to build a network where nodes represent functional terms and edges represent the similarity between them. Unlike competing methods, PANs are calculated for each sample independent of the population, making it a more general solution to the single-sample network problem. Using three breast cancer datasets as a case study (METABRIC and a super-set of GEO studies), we show that PAN classifiers not only predict cancer relapse better than gene features alone, but also outperform PPI and population-level graph-based classifiers. This work demonstrates the practical advantages of graph-based classification for high-dimensional genomic data, while offering a new approach to making sample-specific networks.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In this paper, we propose a sparse neural encoder-decoder network to predict metabolite abundances from microbe abundances. Using paired data from a cohort of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients, we show that our neural encoder-decoder model outperforms linear univariate and multivariate methods in terms of accuracy, sparsity, and stability. Importantly, we show that our neural encoder-decoder model is not simply a black box designed to maximize predictive accuracy. Rather, the network{\textquoteright}s hidden layer (i.e., the latent space, comprised only of sparsely weighted microbe counts) actually captures key microbe-metabolite relationships that are themselves clinically meaningful. Although this hidden layer is learned without any knowledge of the patient{\textquoteright}s diagnosis, we show that the learned latent features are structured in a way that predicts IBD and treatment status with high accuracy. By imposing a non-negative weights constraint, the network becomes a directed graph where each downstream node is interpretable as the additive combination of the upstream nodes. Here, the middle layer comprises distinct microbe-metabolite axes that relate key microbial biomarkers with metabolite biomarkers. By pre-processing the microbiome and metabolome data using compositional data analysis methods, we ensure that our proposed multi-omics workflow will generalize to any pair of -omics data. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first application of neural encoder-decoders for the interpretable integration of multi-omics biological data.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning architecture, called DeepTRIAGE (Deep learning for the TRactable Individualised Analysis of Gene Expression), which not only classifies cancer sub-types with good accuracy, but simultaneously assigns each patient their own set of interpretable and individualised biomarker scores.

	abstract = {In the progression of cancer, cells acquire genetic mutations that cause uncontrolled growth. Over time, the primary tumour may undergo additional mutations that allow for the cancerous cells to spread throughout the body as metastases. Since metastatic development typically results in markedly worse patient outcomes, research into the identity and function of metastasis-associated biomarkers could eventually translate into clinical diagnostics or novel therapeutics. Although the general processes underpinning metastatic progression are understood, no clear cross-cancer biomarker profile has emerged. However, the literature suggests that some microRNAs (miRNAs) may play an important role in the metastatic progression of several cancer types. Using a subset of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data, we performed an integrated analysis of mRNA and miRNA expression with paired metastatic and primary tumour samples to interrogate how the miRNA{\textendash}mRNA regulatory axis influences metastatic progression. From this, we successfully built mRNA- and miRNA-specific classifiers that can discriminate pairs of metastatic and primary samples across 11 cancer types. In addition, we identified a number of miRNAs whose metastasis-associated dysregulation could predict mRNA metastasis-associated dysregulation. Among the most predictive miRNAs, we found several previously implicated in cancer progression, including miR-301b, miR-1296, and miR-423. Taken together, our results suggest that metastatic samples have a common cross-cancer signature when compared with their primary tumour pair, and that these miRNA biomarkers can be used to predict metastatic status as well as mRNA expression.},

This task, known as classification, is typically solved using a suite of algorithms that learn a mathematical rule capable of discriminating one group (``cases'') from another (``controls''). However, discriminatory methods can only identify cancerous samples that resemble those that the algorithm already saw during training. As such, discriminatory methods may be ill-suited for the classification of cancer: because the possibility space of cancer is definitively large, the existence of a one-of-a-kind gene expression signature is likely. Instead, we propose using an established surveillance method that detects anomalous samples based on their deviation from a learned normal steady-state structure. By transferring this method to transcriptomic data, we can create an anomaly detector for tissue transcriptomes, a ``tissue detector'', that is capable of identifying cancer without ever seeing a single cancer example. As a proof-of-concept, we train a ``tissue detector'' on normal GTEx samples that can classify TCGA samples with {\textgreater}90{\textbackslash}\% AUC for 3 out of 6 tissues. Importantly, we find that the classification accuracy is improved simply by adding more healthy samples.

	abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a markedly heterogeneous condition with a varied phenotypic presentation. Its high concordance among siblings, as well as its clear association with specific genetic disorders, both point to a strong genetic etiology. However, the molecular basis of ASD is still poorly understood, although recent studies point to the existence of sex-specific ASD pathophysiologies and biomarkers. Despite this, little is known about how exactly sex influences the gene expression signatures of ASD probands. In an effort to identify sex-dependent biomarkers and characterize their function, we present an analysis of a single paired-end postmortem brain RNA-Seq data set and a meta-analysis of six blood-based microarray data sets. Here, we identify several genes with sex-dependent dysregulation, and many more with sex-independent dysregulation. Moreover, through pathway analysis, we find that these sex-independent biomarkers have substantially different biological roles than the sex-dependent biomarkers, and that some of these pathways are ubiquitously dysregulated in both postmortem brain and blood. We conclude by synthesizing the discovered biomarker profiles with the extant literature, by highlighting the advantage of studying sex-specific dysregulation directly, and by making a call for new transcriptomic data that comprise large female cohorts.},

	abstract = {Although neuropsychiatric disorders have an established genetic background, their molecular foundations remain elusive. This has prompted many investigators to search for explanatory biomarkers that can predict clinical outcomes. One approach uses machine learning to classify patients based on blood mRNA expression. However, these endeavors typically fail to achieve the high level of performance, stability, and generalizability required for clinical translation. Moreover, these classifiers can lack interpretability because not all genes have relevance to researchers. For this study, we hypothesized that annotation-based classifiers can improve classification performance, stability, generalizability, and interpretability. To this end, we evaluated the models of four classification algorithms on six neuropsychiatric data sets using four annotation databases. Our results suggest that the Gene Ontology Biological Process database can transform gene expression into an annotation-based feature space that is accurate and stable. We also show how annotation features can improve the interpretability of classifiers: as annotations are used to assign biological importance to genes, the biological importance of annotation-based features are the features themselves. In evaluating the annotation features, we find that top ranked annotations tend contain top ranked genes, suggesting that the most predictive annotations are a superset of the most predictive genes. Based on this, and the fact that annotations are used routinely to assign biological importance to genetic data, we recommend transforming gene-level expression into annotation-level expression prior to the classification of neuropsychiatric conditions.},

We propose a mathematical model for how bias distorts community measurements based on the properties of real experiments. We validate this model with 16S rRNA gene and shotgun metagenomics data from defined bacterial communities. Our model better fits the experimental data despite being simpler than previous models. We illustrate how our model can be used to evaluate protocols, to understand the effect of bias on downstream statistical analyses, and to measure and correct bias given suitable calibration controls. These results illuminate new avenues toward truly quantitative and reproducible metagenomics measurements.},

We use these sample-specific networks to study changes in network topology across time and to characterize shifts in gene regulation that were not apparent in the expression data. We believe that generating sample-specific networks will greatly facilitate the application of network methods to large, complex, and heterogeneous multi-omic datasets, supporting the emerging field of precision network medicine.},

	abstract = {Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most lethal brain malignancy lacking effective treatment. In this study, we demonstrate that BCL6 is a prognostic marker and a targetable GBM-promoting factor. Silencing of BCL6 inhibits the malignant phenotype of GBM cells and triggers cellular senescence. We also identify AXL as an important BCL6 transcriptional target, the expression of which is also regulated positively by NCoR, a BCL6 cofactor. Either silencing of BCL6 or targeted disruption of the BCL6/NCoR complex diminishes AXL expression and inhibits GBM growth. This study elucidates a crucial BCL6-mediated signaling pathway in GBM biology. More importantly, our results highlight the promise and merit of targeting BCL6 for treating this deadly disease., ZBTB transcription factors orchestrate gene transcription during tissue development. However, their roles in glioblastoma (GBM) remain unexplored. Here, through a functional screening of ZBTB genes, we identify that BCL6 is required for GBM cell viability and that BCL6 overexpression is associated with worse prognosis. In a somatic transgenic mouse model, depletion of Bcl6 inhibits the progression of KrasG12V-driven high-grade glioma. Transcriptome analysis demonstrates the involvement of BCL6 in tumor protein p53 (TP53), erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog (ErbB), and MAPK signaling pathways. Indeed, BCL6 represses the expression of wild-type p53 and its target genes in GBM cells. Knockdown of BCL6 augments the activation of TP53 pathway in response to radiation. Importantly, we discover that receptor tyrosine kinase AXL is a transcriptional target of BCL6 in GBM and mediates partially the regulatory effects of BCL6 on both MEK-ERK (mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase{\textendash}extracellular signal-regulated kinase) and S6K-RPS6 (ribosomal protein S6 kinase{\textendash}ribosomal protein S6) axes. Similar to BCL6 silencing, depletion of AXL profoundly attenuates GBM proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, targeted inhibition of BCL6/nuclear receptor corepressor 1 (NCoR) complex by peptidomimetic inhibitor not only significantly decreases AXL expression and the activity of MEK-ERK and S6K-RPS6 cascades but also displays a potent antiproliferative effect against GBM cells. Together, these findings uncover a glioma-promoting role of BCL6 and provide the rationale of targeting BCL6 as a potential therapeutic approach.},

In pathological settings, mostly in lung and breast cancer and in glioblastoma, the EGFR is a driver of tumorigenesis. Inappropriate activation of the EGFR in cancer mainly results from amplification and point mutations at the genomic locus, but transcriptional upregulation or ligand overproduction due to autocrine/paracrine mechanisms has also been described. Moreover, the EGFR is increasingly recognized as a biomarker of resistance in tumors, as its amplification or secondary mutations have been found to arise under drug pressure. This evidence, in addition to the prominent function that this receptor plays in normal epithelia, has prompted intense investigations into the role of the EGFR both at physiological and at pathological level. Despite the large body of knowledge obtained over the last two decades, previously unrecognized (herein defined as {\textquoteleft}noncanonical{\textquoteright}) functions of the EGFR are currently emerging. Here, we will initially review the canonical ligand-induced EGFR signaling pathway, with particular emphasis to its regulation by endocytosis and subversion in human tumors. We will then focus on the most recent advances in uncovering noncanonical EGFR functions in stress-induced trafficking, autophagy, and energy metabolism, with a perspective on future therapeutic applications.},

Over the course of just a few years, deep learning has revolutionized several research fields such as bioinformatics and medicine with its flexibility and ability to process large and complex datasets. As ecological datasets are becoming larger and more complex, we believe these methods can be useful to ecologists as well. In this paper, we review existing implementations and show that deep learning has been used successfully to identify species, classify animal behaviour and estimate biodiversity in large datasets like camera-trap images, audio recordings and videos. We demonstrate that deep learning can be beneficial to most ecological disciplines, including applied contexts, such as management and conservation. We also identify common questions about how and when to use deep learning, such as what are the steps required to create a deep learning network, which tools are available to help, and what are the requirements in terms of data and computer power. We provide guidelines, recommendations and useful resources, including a reference flowchart to help ecologists get started with deep learning. We argue that at a time when automatic monitoring of populations and ecosystems generates a vast amount of data that cannot be effectively processed by humans anymore, deep learning could become a powerful reference tool for ecologists.},

Empirical data suggest that across the biomedical literature (1990{\textendash}2015), when abstracts use P values 96\% of them have P values of 0.05 or less. The same percentage (96\%) applies for full-text articles. Among 100 articles in PubMed, 55 report P values, while only 4 present confidence intervals for all the reported effect sizes, none use Bayesian methods and none use false-discovery rate. Over 25 years (1990{\textendash}2015), use of P values in abstracts has doubled for all PubMed, and tripled for meta-analyses, while for some types of designs such as randomized trials the majority of abstracts report P values. There is major selective reporting for P values. Abstracts tend to highlight most favorable P values and inferences use even further spin to reach exaggerated, unreliable conclusions. The availability of large-scale data on P values from many papers has allowed the development and applications of methods that try to detect and model selection biases, for example, p-hacking, that cause patterns of excess significance. Inferences need to be cautious as they depend on the assumptions made by these models and can be affected by the presence of other biases (e.g., confounding in observational studies). While much of the unreliability of past and present research is driven by small, underpowered studies, NHST with P values may be also particularly problematic in the era of overpowered big data. NHST and P values are optimal only in a minority of current research. Using a more stringent threshold, as in the recently proposed shift from P {\textless} 0.05 to P {\textless} 0.005, is a temporizing measure to contain the flood and death-by-significance. NHST and P values may be replaced in many fields by other, more fit-for-purpose, inferential methods. However, curtailing selection biases requires additional measures, beyond changes in inferential methods, and in particular reproducible research practices.},

The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias.

	abstract = {The worldwide obesity epidemic has been mainly attributed to lifestyle changes. However, who becomes obese in an obesity-prone environment is largely determined by genetic factors. In the last 20~years, important progress has been made in the elucidation of the genetic architecture of obesity. In parallel with successful gene identifications, the number of gene-environment interaction (GEI) studies has grown rapidly. This paper reviews the growing body of evidence supporting gene-environment interactions in the field of obesity. Heritability, monogenic and polygenic obesity studies provide converging evidence that obesity-predisposing genes interact with a variety of environmental, lifestyle and treatment exposures. However, some skepticism remains regarding the validity of these studies based on several issues, which include statistical modelling, confounding, low replication rate, underpowered analyses, biological assumptions and measurement precision. What follows in this review includes (1) an introduction to the study of GEI, (2) the evidence of GEI in the field of obesity, (3) an outline of the biological mechanisms that may explain these interaction effects, (4) methodological challenges associated with GEI studies and potential solutions, and (5) future directions of GEI research. Thus far, this growing body of evidence has provided a deeper understanding of GEI influencing obesity and may have tremendous applications in the emerging field of personalized medicine and individualized lifestyle recommendations.},

In this paper, we develop a novel framework for detecting statistical interactions captured by a feedforward multilayer neural network by directly interpreting its learned weights. Depending on the desired interactions, our method can achieve significantly better or similar interaction detection performance compared to the state-of-the-art without searching an exponential solution space of possible interactions. We obtain this accuracy and efficiency by observing that interactions between input features are created by the non-additive effect of nonlinear activation functions, and that interacting paths are encoded in weight matrices. We demonstrate the performance of our method and the importance of discovered interactions via experimental results on both synthetic datasets and real-world application datasets.},

	abstract = {The gender difference in cancer susceptibility is one of the most consistent findings in cancer epidemiology. Hematologic malignancies are generally more common in males and this can be generalized to most other cancers. Similar gender differences in non-malignant diseases including autoimmunity, are attributed to hormonal or behavioral differences. Even in early childhood, however, where these differences would not apply, there are differences in cancer incidence between males and females. In childhood, few cancers are more common in females, but overall, males have higher susceptibility. In Hodgkin lymphoma, the gender ratio reverses toward adolescence. The pattern that autoimmune disorders are more common in females, but cancer and infections in males suggests that the known differences in immunity may be responsible for this dichotomy. Besides immune surveillance, genome surveillance mechanisms also differ in efficiency between males and females. Other obvious differences include hormonal ones and the number of X chromosomes. Some of the differences may even originate from exposures during prenatal development. This review will summarize well-documented examples of gender effect in cancer susceptibility, discuss methodological issues in exploration of gender differences, and present documented or speculated mechanisms. The gender differential in susceptibility can give important clues for the etiology of cancers and should be examined in all genetic and non-genetic association studies.},

We propose three desiderata for explanations in general -- explicitness, faithfulness, and stability -- and show that existing methods do not satisfy them. In response, we design self-explaining models in stages, progressively generalizing linear classifiers to complex yet architecturally explicit models. Faithfulness and stability are enforced via regularization specifically tailored to such models. Experimental results across various benchmark datasets show that our framework offers a promising direction for reconciling model complexity and interpretability.},

This development equips doctors and medical staff with tools to evaluate their hypotheses and hence make more precise decisions. Although most current research in the literature seeks to develop techniques and methods for predicting one particular clinical outcome, this approach is far from the reality of clinical decision making in which you have to consider several factors simultaneously. In addition, it is difficult to follow the recent progress concretely as there is a lack of consistency in benchmark datasets and task definitions in the field of Genomics. To address the aforementioned issues, we provide a clinical Meta-Dataset derived from the publicly available data hub called The Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA) that contains 174 tasks. We believe those tasks could be good proxy tasks to develop methods which can work on a few samples of gene expression data. Also, learning to predict multiple clinical variables using gene-expression data is an important task due to the variety of phenotypes in clinical problems and lack of samples for some of the rare variables. The defined tasks cover a wide range of clinical problems including predicting tumor tissue site, white cell count, histological type, family history of cancer, gender, and many others which we explain later in the paper. Each task represents an independent dataset. We use regression and neural network baselines for all the tasks using only 150 samples and compare their performance.},

	abstract = {Neural machine translation is a recently proposed approach to machine translation. Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of encoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the (soft-)alignments found by the model agree well with our intuition.},

To accomplish this, many researchers are turning toward machine learning (ML), an approach of artificial intelligence (AI) that utilizes modern algorithms to give computers the ability to learn. Much of the effort to advance ML for precision medicine has been focused on the development and implementation of algorithms and the generation of ever larger quantities of genomic sequence data and electronic health records. However, relevance and accuracy of the data are as important as quantity of data in the advancement of ML for precision medicine. For common diseases, physiological genomic readouts in disease-applicable tissues may be an effective surrogate to measure the effect of genetic and environmental factors and their interactions that underlie disease development and progression. Disease-applicable tissue may be difficult to obtain, but there are important exceptions such as kidney needle biopsy specimens. As AI continues to advance, new analytical approaches, including those that go beyond data correlation, need to be developed and ethical issues of AI need to be addressed. Physiological genomic readouts in disease-relevant tissues, combined with advanced AI, can be a powerful approach for precision medicine for common diseases.},

The sj(.)sj(.)s\_j({\textbackslash}cdot)'s are unspecified functions that are estimated using a scatterplot smoother, in an iterative procedure we call the local scoring algorithm. The technique is applicable to any likelihood-based regression model: the class of generalized linear models contains many of these. In this class the linear predictor $\eta$=$\Sigma$$\beta$jXj$\eta$=$\Sigma$$\beta$jXj{\textbackslash}eta = {\textbackslash}Sigma {\textbackslash}beta\_jX\_j is replaced by the additive predictor $\Sigma$sj(Xj)$\Sigma$sj(Xj){\textbackslash}Sigma s\_j(X\_j); hence, the name generalized additive models. We illustrate the technique with binary response and survival data. In both cases, the method proves to be useful in uncovering nonlinear covariate effects. It has the advantage of being completely automatic, i.e., no "detective work" is needed on the part of the statistician. As a theoretical underpinning, the technique is viewed as an empirical method of maximizing the expected log likelihood, or equivalently, of minimizing the Kullback-Leibler distance to the true model.},

For an analysis to be subcompositionally coherent, it suffices to analyze the ratios of the data values. A common approach to dimension reduction in compositional data analysis is to perform principal component analysis on the logarithms of ratios, but this method does not obey the principle of distributional equivalence. We show that by introducing weights for the rows and columns, the method achieves this desirable property and can be applied to a wider class of methods. This weighted log-ratio analysis is theoretically equivalent to {\textquotedblleft}spectral mapping{\textquotedblright}, a multivariate method developed almost 30~years ago for displaying ratio-scale data from biological activity spectra. The close relationship between spectral mapping and correspondence analysis is also explained, as well as their connection with association modeling.

The approach is used in fields like geochemistry of waters or sedimentary rocks, environmental studies related to air pollution, physicochemical analysis of glass fragments in forensic science, and among many others. In these fields, rounded zeros and nondetects are usually regarded as left-censored data that hamper any subsequent data analysis.

Its high concordance among siblings, as well as its clear association with specific genetic disorders, both point to a strong genetic etiology. However, the molecular basis of ASD is still poorly understood, although recent studies point to the existence of sex-specific ASD pathophysiologies and biomarkers. Despite this, little is known about how exactly sex influences the gene expression signatures of ASD probands. In an effort to identify sex-dependent biomarkers and characterize their function, we present an analysis of a single paired-end postmortem brain RNA-Seq data set and a meta-analysis of six blood-based microarray data sets. Here, we identify several genes with sex-dependent dysregulation, and many more with sex-independent dysregulation. Moreover, through pathway analysis, we find that these sex-independent biomarkers have substantially different biological roles than the sex-dependent biomarkers, and that some of these pathways are ubiquitously dysregulated in both postmortem brain and blood. We conclude by synthesizing the discovered biomarker profiles with the extant literature, by highlighting the advantage of studying sex-specific dysregulation directly, and by making a call for new transcriptomic data that comprise large female cohorts.},

This has prompted many investigators to search for explanatory biomarkers that can predict clinical outcomes. One approach uses machine learning to classify patients based on blood mRNA expression. However, these endeavors typically fail to achieve the high level of performance, stability, and generalizability required for clinical translation. Moreover, these classifiers can lack interpretability because not all genes have relevance to researchers. For this study, we hypothesized that annotation-based classifiers can improve classification performance, stability, generalizability, and interpretability. To this end, we evaluated the models of four classification algorithms on six neuropsychiatric data sets using four annotation databases. Our results suggest that the Gene Ontology Biological Process database can transform gene expression into an annotation-based feature space that is accurate and stable. We also show how annotation features can improve the interpretability of classifiers: as annotations are used to assign biological importance to genes, the biological importance of annotation-based features are the features themselves. In evaluating the annotation features, we find that top ranked annotations tend contain top ranked genes, suggesting that the most predictive annotations are a superset of the most predictive genes. Based on this, and the fact that annotations are used routinely to assign biological importance to genetic data, we recommend transforming gene-level expression into annotation-level expression prior to the classification of neuropsychiatric conditions.},

	abstract = {Since the turn of the century, researchers have sought to diagnose cancer based on gene expression signatures measured from the blood or biopsy as biomarkers. This task, known as classification, is typically solved using a suite of algorithms that learn a mathematical rule capable of discriminating one group (``cases'') from another (``controls''). However, discriminatory methods can only identify cancerous samples that resemble those that the algorithm already saw during training. As such, discriminatory methods may be ill-suited for the classification of cancer: because the possibility space of cancer is definitively large, the existence of a one-of-a-kind gene expression signature is likely. Instead, we propose using an established surveillance method that detects anomalous samples based on their deviation from a learned normal steady-state structure. By transferring this method to transcriptomic data, we can create an anomaly detector for tissue transcriptomes, a ``tissue detector'', that is capable of identifying cancer without ever seeing a single cancer example. As a proof-of-concept, we train a ``tissue detector'' on normal GTEx samples that can classify TCGA samples with {\textgreater}90{\textbackslash}\% AUC for 3 out of 6 tissues. Importantly, we find that the classification accuracy is improved simply by adding more healthy samples. We conclude this report by emphasizing the conceptual advantages of anomaly detection and by highlighting future directions for this field of study.},

	abstract = {In the progression of cancer, cells acquire genetic mutations that cause uncontrolled growth. Over time, the primary tumour may undergo additional mutations that allow for the cancerous cells to spread throughout the body as metastases. Since metastatic development typically results in markedly worse patient outcomes, research into the identity and function of metastasis-associated biomarkers could eventually translate into clinical diagnostics or novel therapeutics. Although the general processes underpinning metastatic progression are understood, no clear cross-cancer biomarker profile has emerged. However, the literature suggests that some microRNAs (miRNAs) may play an important role in the metastatic progression of several cancer types. Using a subset of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data, we performed an integrated analysis of mRNA and miRNA expression with paired metastatic and primary tumour samples to interrogate how the miRNA{\textendash}mRNA regulatory axis influences metastatic progression. From this, we successfully built mRNA- and miRNA-specific classifiers that can discriminate pairs of metastatic and primary samples across 11 cancer types. In addition, we identified a number of miRNAs whose metastasis-associated dysregulation could predict mRNA metastasis-associated dysregulation. Among the most predictive miRNAs, we found several previously implicated in cancer progression, including miR-301b, miR-1296, and miR-423. Taken together, our results suggest that metastatic samples have a common cross-cancer signature when compared with their primary tumour pair, and that these miRNA biomarkers can be used to predict metastatic status as well as mRNA expression.},

In the present study, we sought to combine two discovery-based approaches: (1) white matter query language was used to parcellate the brain's white matter into tracts connecting pairs of 34, bilateral cortical regions and (2) the diffusion imaging characteristics of the resulting tracts were analyzed using a machine-learning method called support vector machine in order to optimize the selection of a set of imaging features that maximally discriminated 22q11.2DS and comparison subjects. With this unique approach, we both confirmed previously-recognized 22q11.2DS-related abnormalities in the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), and identified, for the first time, 22q11.2DS-related anomalies in the middle longitudinal fascicle and the extreme capsule, which may have been overlooked in previous, hypothesis-guided studies. We further observed that, in participants with 22q11.2DS, ILF metrics were significantly associated with positive prodromal symptoms of psychosis.},

In the past half-decade, research on neuropsychiatric disorders has reached an important milestone: the identification of susceptibility genes reliably associated with complex psychiatric disorders at genome-wide levels of significance. This age of discovery provides the groundwork for follow-up studies designed to elucidate the mechanism(s) by which genetic variants confer susceptibility to these disorders. The gene encoding zinc-finger protein 804 A (ZNF804A) is among these candidate genes, recently being found to be strongly associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder via one of its non-coding mutations, rs1344706. Neurobiological, molecular, and bioinformatic analyses have improved our understanding of ZNF804A in general and this variant in particular; however, more work is needed to establish the mechanism(s) by which ZNF804A variants impinge on the biological substrates of the two disorders. Here, we review literature recently published on ZNF804A, and analyze critical concepts related to the biology of ZNF804A and the role of rs1344706 in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. We synthesize the results of new bioinformatic analyses of ZNF804A with key elements of the existing literature and knowledge base. Furthermore, we suggest some potentially fruitful short- and long-term research goals in the assessment of ZNF804A. {\textcopyright} 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

We sought to combine the subject-level data from previously published studies by mega-analysis to increase the statistical power. We identified studies that compared ex vivo blood or lymphocytes from ASD-affected individuals and unrelated comparison subjects using Affymetrix or Illumina array platforms. Raw microarray data and clinical meta-data were obtained from seven studies, totaling 626 affected and 447 comparison subjects. Microarray data were processed using uniform methods. Covariate-controlled mixed-effect linear models were used to identify gene transcripts and co-expression network modules that were significantly associated with diagnostic status. Permutation-based gene-set analysis was used to identify functionally related sets of genes that were over- and under-expressed among ASD samples. Our results were consistent with diminished interferon-, EGF-, PDGF-, PI3K-AKT-mTOR-, and RAS-MAPK-signaling cascades, and increased ribosomal translation and NK-cell related activity in ASD. We explored evidence for sex-differences in the ASD-related transcriptomic signature. We also demonstrated that machine-learning classifiers using blood transcriptome data perform with moderate accuracy when data are combined across studies. Comparing our results with those from blood-based studies of protein biomarkers (e.g., cytokines and trophic factors), we propose that ASD may feature decoupling between certain circulating signaling proteins (higher in ASD samples) and the transcriptional cascades which they typically elicit within circulating immune cells (lower in ASD samples). These findings provide insight into ASD-related transcriptional differences in circulating immune cells. {\textcopyright} 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Abstract{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Gene expression data, such as those generated by next generation sequencing technologies (RNA-seq), are of an inherently relative nature: the total number of sequenced reads has no biological meaning. This issue is most often addressed with various normalization techniques which all face the same problem: once information about the total mRNA content of the origin cells is lost, it cannot be recovered by mere technical means. Additional knowledge, in the form of an unchanged reference, is necessary; however, this reference can usually only be estimated. Here we propose a novel method where sample normalization is unnecessary, but important insights can be obtained nevertheless. Instead of trying to recover absolute abundances, our method is entirely based on ratios, so normalization factors cancel by default. Although the differential expression of individual genes cannot be recovered this way, the ratios themselves can be differentially expressed (even when their constituents are not). Yet, most current analyses are blind to these cases, while our approach reveals them directly. Specifically, we show how the differential expression of gene ratios can be formalized by decomposing log-ratio variance (LRV) and deriving intuitive statistics from it. Although small LRVs have been used to detect proportional genes in gene expression data before, we focus here on the change in proportionality factors between groups of samples (e.g. tissue-specific proportionality). For this, we propose a statistic that is equivalent to the squared \textit{t}-statistic of one-way ANOVA, but for gene ratios. In doing so, we show how precision weights can be incorporated to account for the peculiarities of count data, and, moreover, how a moderated statistic can be derived in the same way as the one following from a hierarchical model for individual genes. We also discuss approaches to deal with zero counts, deriving an expression of our statistic that is able to incorporate them. In providing a detailed analysis of the connections between the differential expression of genes and the differential proportionality of pairs, we facilitate a clear interpretation of new concepts. The proposed framework is applied to a data set from GTEx consisting of 98 samples from the cerebellum and cortex, with selected examples shown. A computationally efficient implementation of the approach in R has been released as an addendum to the propr package.$^{\textrm{1}}${\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

However, it has proved difficult to accurately predict survival outcomes and treatment responses, despite advancements in the field. In this manuscript, we show how transforming gene expression data into a set of personalized (sample-specific) networks can allow us to harness existing graph-based methods to improve classifier performance. Existing approaches to personalized gene networks, based on protein-protein interactions (PPI) or population-level models, all have the limitation that they depend on other samples in the data and must get re-computed whenever a new sample is introduced. Here, we propose a novel method, called Personalized Annotation-based Networks (PAN), that avoids this limitation by using curated annotation databases to transform gene expression data into a graph. These databases organize genes into overlapping gene sets, called annotations, that we use to build a network where nodes represent functional terms and edges represent the similarity between them. Unlike competing methods, PANs are calculated for each sample independent of the population, making it a more general solution to the single-sample network problem. Using three breast cancer datasets as a case study (METABRIC and a super-set of GEO studies), we show that PAN classifiers not only predict cancer relapse better than gene features alone, but also outperform PPI and population-level graph-based classifiers. This work demonstrates the practical advantages of graph-based classification for high-dimensional genomic data, while offering a new approach to making sample-specific networks.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Eight association studies (seven published and one unpublished) fulfilled criteria for inclusion in our meta-analysis. We also incorporated GWAS data for ADGRL3. In order to avoid overlapping samples, we started with summary statistics from GWAS samples and then added data from gene association studies. The results of our meta-analysis suggest an effect of ADGRL3 variants on ADHD susceptibility in children (n = 8724/14,644 cases/controls and 1893 families): rs6551665 A allele (Z score = -2.701; p = 0.0069); rs1947274 A allele (Z score = -2.033; p = 0.0421); rs1947275 T allele (Z score = 2.339; p = 0.0978); and rs2345039 C allele (Z score = 3.806; p = 0.0026).

	abstract = {A series of new chiral macrocycles containing the trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane (DACH) subunit and arene- and oligoethylene glycol-derived spacers has been prepared in enantiomerically pure form. Four of the macrocycles have been characterized by X-ray crystallography, which reveals a consistent mode of intramolecular N{\textendash}H{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}N hydrogen bonding and conformational variations about the N-benzylic bonds. Most of the macrocycles were found to differentiate the enantiomers of mandelic acid (MA) by 1H NMR spectroscopy in CDCl3; within the series of macrocycles tested, enantiodiscrimination was promoted by (i) a meta-linkage geometry about the arene spacer, (ii) the presence of naphthalene- rather than phenylene-derived arene spacers, and (iii) increasing length of the oligoethylene glycol bridge. 1H NMR titrations were performed with optically pure MA samples, and the data were fitted to a simultaneous 1:1 and 2:1 binding model, yielding estimates of 2:1 binding constants between some of the macrocycles and MA enantiomers. In several cases, NOESY spectra of the MA:macrocycle complexes show differential intramolecular correlations between protons adjacent to the amine and carboxylic acid groups of the macrocycles and MA enantiomers, respectively, thus demonstrating geometric differences between the diastereomeric intermolecular complexes. The three most effective macrocycles were employed as chiral solvating agents (CSAs) to determine the enantiomeric excess (ee) of 18 MA samples over a wide ee range and with very high accuracy (1\% absolute error).},

	abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a markedly heterogeneous condition with a varied phenotypic presentation. Its high concordance among siblings, as well as its clear association with specific genetic disorders, both point to a strong genetic etiology. However, the molecular basis of ASD is still poorly understood, although recent studies point to the existence of sex-specific ASD pathophysiologies and biomarkers. Despite this, little is known about how exactly sex influences the gene expression signatures of ASD probands. In an effort to identify sex-dependent biomarkers and characterize their function, we present an analysis of a single paired-end postmortem brain RNA-Seq data set and a meta-analysis of six blood-based microarray data sets. Here, we identify several genes with sex-dependent dysregulation, and many more with sex-independent dysregulation. Moreover, through pathway analysis, we find that these sex-independent biomarkers have substantially different biological roles than the sex-dependent biomarkers, and that some of these pathways are ubiquitously dysregulated in both postmortem brain and blood. We conclude by synthesizing the discovered biomarker profiles with the extant literature, by highlighting the advantage of studying sex-specific dysregulation directly, and by making a call for new transcriptomic data that comprise large female cohorts.},

Among these advances include sophisticated high-throughput assays that measure the relative abundance of microorganisms, RNA molecules, and metabolites. While these data are most often collected to gain new insights into biological systems, they can also be used as biomarkers to create clinically useful diagnostic classifiers. How best to classify high-dimensional {\textquotedblleft}-omics{\textquotedblright} data remains an area of active research.

This report (a) emphasizes the relative nature of health biomarkers, (b) discusses the literature surrounding the classification of relative data, and (c) benchmarks how different transformations perform across multiple biomarker types. In doing so, this report explores how one could use balances to engineer features prior to classification, and proposes a simple procedure, called discriminative balance analysis, to select discriminative 2- and 3-part balances.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This has prompted many investigators to search for explanatory biomarkers that can predict clinical outcomes. One approach uses machine learning to classify patients based on blood mRNA expression. However, these endeavors typically fail to achieve the high level of performance, stability, and generalizability required for clinical translation. Moreover, these classifiers can lack interpretability because not all genes have relevance to researchers. For this study, we hypothesized that annotation-based classifiers can improve classification performance, stability, generalizability, and interpretability. To this end, we evaluated the models of four classification algorithms on six neuropsychiatric data sets using four annotation databases. Our results suggest that the Gene Ontology Biological Process database can transform gene expression into an annotation-based feature space that is accurate and stable. We also show how annotation features can improve the interpretability of classifiers: as annotations are used to assign biological importance to genes, the biological importance of annotation-based features are the features themselves. In evaluating the annotation features, we find that top ranked annotations tend contain top ranked genes, suggesting that the most predictive annotations are a superset of the most predictive genes. Based on this, and the fact that annotations are used routinely to assign biological importance to genetic data, we recommend transforming gene-level expression into annotation-level expression prior to the classification of neuropsychiatric conditions.},

This task, known as classification, is typically solved using a suite of algorithms that learn a mathematical rule capable of discriminating one group (``cases'') from another (``controls''). However, discriminatory methods can only identify cancerous samples that resemble those that the algorithm already saw during training. As such, discriminatory methods may be ill-suited for the classification of cancer: because the possibility space of cancer is definitively large, the existence of a one-of-a-kind gene expression signature is likely. Instead, we propose using an established surveillance method that detects anomalous samples based on their deviation from a learned normal steady-state structure. By transferring this method to transcriptomic data, we can create an anomaly detector for tissue transcriptomes, a ``tissue detector'', that is capable of identifying cancer without ever seeing a single cancer example. As a proof-of-concept, we train a ``tissue detector'' on normal GTEx samples that can classify TCGA samples with {\textgreater}90{\textbackslash}\% AUC for 3 out of 6 tissues. Importantly, we find that the classification accuracy is improved simply by adding more healthy samples.

In this paper, we propose a sparse neural encoder-decoder network to predict metabolite abundances from microbe abundances. Using paired data from a cohort of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients, we show that our neural encoder-decoder model outperforms linear univariate and multivariate methods in terms of accuracy, sparsity, and stability. Importantly, we show that our neural encoder-decoder model is not simply a black box designed to maximize predictive accuracy. Rather, the network{\textquoteright}s hidden layer (i.e., the latent space, comprised only of sparsely weighted microbe counts) actually captures key microbe-metabolite relationships that are themselves clinically meaningful. Although this hidden layer is learned without any knowledge of the patient{\textquoteright}s diagnosis, we show that the learned latent features are structured in a way that predicts IBD and treatment status with high accuracy. By imposing a non-negative weights constraint, the network becomes a directed graph where each downstream node is interpretable as the additive combination of the upstream nodes. Here, the middle layer comprises distinct microbe-metabolite axes that relate key microbial biomarkers with metabolite biomarkers. By pre-processing the microbiome and metabolome data using compositional data analysis methods, we ensure that our proposed multi-omics workflow will generalize to any pair of -omics data. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first application of neural encoder-decoders for the interpretable integration of multi-omics biological data.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {In the progression of cancer, cells acquire genetic mutations that cause uncontrolled growth. Over time, the primary tumour may undergo additional mutations that allow for the cancerous cells to spread throughout the body as metastases. Since metastatic development typically results in markedly worse patient outcomes, research into the identity and function of metastasis-associated biomarkers could eventually translate into clinical diagnostics or novel therapeutics. Although the general processes underpinning metastatic progression are understood, no clear cross-cancer biomarker profile has emerged. However, the literature suggests that some microRNAs (miRNAs) may play an important role in the metastatic progression of several cancer types. Using a subset of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data, we performed an integrated analysis of mRNA and miRNA expression with paired metastatic and primary tumour samples to interrogate how the miRNA{\textendash}mRNA regulatory axis influences metastatic progression. From this, we successfully built mRNA- and miRNA-specific classifiers that can discriminate pairs of metastatic and primary samples across 11 cancer types. In addition, we identified a number of miRNAs whose metastasis-associated dysregulation could predict mRNA metastasis-associated dysregulation. Among the most predictive miRNAs, we found several previously implicated in cancer progression, including miR-301b, miR-1296, and miR-423. Taken together, our results suggest that metastatic samples have a common cross-cancer signature when compared with their primary tumour pair, and that these miRNA biomarkers can be used to predict metastatic status as well as mRNA expression.},

However, these kinds of analyses are complicated by the compositional (i.e., relative) nature of the data. Recently, Morton et al. proposed a neural network architecture called mmvec to predict metabolite abundances from microbe presence. They introduce this method as a scale invariant solution to the integration of multi-omics compositional data, and claim that {\textquotedblleft}mmvec is the only method robust to scale deviations{\textquotedblright}. We do not doubt the utility of mmvec, but write in defense of simple linear statistics. In fact, when used correctly, correlation and proportionality can actually outperform the mmvec neural network.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}In the health sciences, many data sets produced by next-generation sequencing (NGS) only contain relative information because of biological and technical factors that limit the total number of nucleotides observed for a given sample. As mutually dependent elements, it is not possible to interpret any component in isolation, at least without normalization. The field of compositional data analysis (CoDA) has emerged with alternative methods for relative data based on log-ratio transforms. However, NGS data often contain many more features than samples, and thus require creative new ways to reduce the dimensionality of the data without sacrificing interpretability. The summation of parts, called amalgamation, is a practical way of reducing dimensionality, but can introduce a non-linear distortion to the data. We exploit this non-linearity to propose a powerful yet interpretable dimension reduction method. In this report, we present data-driven amalgamation as a new method and conceptual framework for reducing the dimensionality of compositional data. Unlike expert-driven amalgamation which requires prior domain knowledge, our data-driven amalgamation method uses a genetic algorithm to answer the question, 99What is the best way to amalgamate the data to achieve the user-defined objective?99. We present a user-friendly R package, called amalgam, that can quickly find the optimal amalgamation to (a) preserve the distance between samples, or (b) classify samples as diseased or not. Our benchmark on 13 real data sets confirm that these amalgamations compete with the state-of-the-art unsupervised and supervised dimension reduction methods in terms of performance, but result in new variables that are much easier to understand: they are groups of features added together.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Although neuropsychiatric disorders have an established genetic background, their molecular foundations remain elusive. This has prompted many investigators to search for explanatory biomarkers that can predict clinical outcomes. One approach uses machine learning to classify patients based on blood mRNA expression. However, these endeavors typically fail to achieve the high level of performance, stability, and generalizability required for clinical translation. Moreover, these classifiers can lack interpretability because not all genes have relevance to researchers. For this study, we hypothesized that annotation-based classifiers can improve classification performance, stability, generalizability, and interpretability. To this end, we evaluated the models of four classification algorithms on six neuropsychiatric data sets using four annotation databases. Our results suggest that the Gene Ontology Biological Process database can transform gene expression into an annotation-based feature space that is accurate and stable. We also show how annotation features can improve the interpretability of classifiers: as annotations are used to assign biological importance to genes, the biological importance of annotation-based features are the features themselves. In evaluating the annotation features, we find that top ranked annotations tend contain top ranked genes, suggesting that the most predictive annotations are a superset of the most predictive genes. Based on this, and the fact that annotations are used routinely to assign biological importance to genetic data, we recommend transforming gene-level expression into annotation-level expression prior to the classification of neuropsychiatric conditions.},

Algorithmic modeling, both in theory and practice, has developed rapidly in fields outside statistics. It can be used both on large complex data sets and as a more accurate and informative alternative to data modeling on smaller data sets.

	abstract = {Since the turn of the century, technological advances have made it possible to obtain the molecular profile of any tissue in a cost-effective manner. Among these advances are sophisticated high-throughput assays that measure the relative abundances of microorganisms, RNA molecules, and metabolites. While these data are most often collected to gain new insights into biological systems, they can also be used as biomarkers to create clinically useful diagnostic classifiers. How best to classify high-dimensional -omics data remains an area of active research. However, few explicitly model the relative nature of these data and instead rely on cumbersome normalizations. This report (i) emphasizes the relative nature of health biomarkers, (ii) discusses the literature surrounding the classification of relative data, and (iii) benchmarks how different transformations perform for regularized logistic regression across multiple biomarker types. We show how an interpretable set of log contrasts, called balances, can prepare data for classification. We propose a simple procedure, called discriminative balance analysis, to select groups of 2 and 3 bacteria that can together discriminate between experimental conditions. Discriminative balance analysis is a fast, accurate, and interpretable alternative to data normalization.
IMPORTANCE High-throughput sequencing provides an easy and cost-effective way to measure the relative abundance of bacteria in any environmental or biological sample. When these samples come from humans, the microbiome signatures can act as biomarkers for disease prediction. However, because bacterial abundance is measured as a composition, the data have unique properties that make conventional analyses inappropriate. To overcome this, analysts often use cumbersome normalizations. This article proposes an alternative method that identifies pairs and trios of bacteria whose stoichiometric presence can differentiate between diseased and nondiseased samples. By using interpretable log contrasts called balances, we developed an entirely normalization-free classification procedure that reduces the feature space and improves the interpretability, without sacrificing classifier performance.},
