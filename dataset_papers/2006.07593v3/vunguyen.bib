	briefly summarizing existing scholarship concerning SNSs, we discuss
	the articles in this special section and conclude with considerations

	in a Smart Device (SD). This component decides on patientâs current
	health status by combining several data, which are acquired either
	by wearable sensors or manually inputted by the patient or retrieved
	from the specific database. In case no abnormal situation has been
	tracked, the DSS takes no action and remains deactivated until next
	abnormal situation pack of data are being acquired or next scheduled
	data being transmitted. The DSS that has been implemented is an integrated
	classification system with two parallel classifiers, combining an
	expert system (rule-based system) and a supervised classifier, such
	as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests, artificial Neural
	Networks (aNN like the Multi-Layer Perceptron), Decision Trees and
	NaÃ¯ve Bayes. The above categorized system is useful for providing
	critical information about the health status of the patient.},

  abstract = {The autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is increasingly being recognized
	as a major public health issue which affects approximately 0.5-0.6%
	of the population. Promoting the general awareness of the disorder,
	increasing the engagement with the affected individuals and their
	carers, and understanding the success of penetration of the current
	clinical recommendations in the target communities, is crucial in
	driving research as well as policy. The aim of the present work is
	to investigate if Twitter, as a highly popular platform for information
	exchange, can be used as a data-mining source which could aid in
	the aforementioned challenges. Specifically, using a large data set
	of harvested tweets, we present a series of experiments which examine
	a range of linguistic and semantic aspects of messages posted by
	individuals interested in ASD. Our findings, the first of their nature
	in the published scientific literature, strongly motivate additional
	research on this topic and present a methodological basis for further
	work.},

	hidden Markov model to include a hierarchy of the hidden states.
	This form of hierarchical modeling has been found useful in applications
	such as handwritten recognition, behavior recognition, video indexing,
	and text retrieval. Nevertheless, the state hierarchy in the original
	HHMM is restricted to a tree structure. This prohibits two different
	states from having the same child, and thus does not allow for sharing
	of common substructures in the model. In this paper, we present a
	general HHMM in which the state hierarchy can be a lattice allowing
	arbitrary sharing of substructures. Furthermore, we provide a method
	for numerical scaling to avoid underflow, an important issue in dealing
	with long observation sequences. We demonstrate the working of our
	method in a simulated environment where a hierarchical behavioral
	model is automatically learned and later used for recognition.},

  abstract = { Permutation modeling is challenging because of the combinatorial
	nature of the problem. However, such modeling is often required in
	many real-world applications, including activity recognition where
	subactivities are often permuted and partially ordered. This paper
	introduces a novel Hidden Permutation Model (HPM) that can learn
	the partial ordering constraints in permuted state sequences. The
	HPMis parameterized as an exponential family distribution and is
	flexible so that it can encode constraints via different feature
	functions. A chain-flipping Metropolis-Hastings Markov chain Monte
	Carlo (MCMC) is employed for inference to overcome the O(n!) complexity.
	Gradient-based maximum likelihood parameter learning is presented
	for two cases when the permutation is known and when it is hidden.
	The HPM is evaluated using both simulated and real data from a location-based
	activity recognition domain. Experimental results indicate that the
	HPM performs far better than other baseline models, including the
	naive Bayes classifier, the HMM classifier, and Kirshners multinomial
	permutation model. Our presented HPM is generic and can potentially
	be utilized in any problem where the modeling of permuted states
	from noisy data is needed.},

	in which both topic selection and ordering are biased to be similar
	across a collection of related documents. We show that this space
	of orderings can be effectively represented using a distribution
	over permutations called the Generalized Mallows Model. We apply
	our method to three complementary discourse-level tasks: cross-document
	alignment, document segmentation, and information ordering. Our experiments
	show that incorporating our permutation-based model in these applications
	yields substantial improvements in performance over previously proposed
	methods.},

	studies have shown that for the isolated and mentally ill, the Web
	and social media provide effective platforms for supports and treatments
	as well as to acquire scientific, clinical understanding of this
	mental condition. More and more individuals affected by depression
	join online communities to seek for information, express themselves,
	share their concerns and look for supports [11]. For the first time,
	we collect and study a large online depression community of more
	than 12,000 active members from Live Journal. We examine the effect
	of mood, social connectivity and age on the online messages authored
	by members in an online depression community. The posts are considered
	in two aspects: what is written (topic) and how it is written (language
	style). We use statistical and machine learning methods to discriminate
	the posts made by bloggers in low versus high valence mood, in different
	age categories and in different degrees of social connectivity. Using
	statistical tests, language styles are found to be significantly
	different between low and high valence cohorts, whilst topics are
	significantly different between people whose different degrees of
	social connectivity. High performance is achieved for low versus
	high valence post classification using writing style as features.
	The finding suggests the potential of using social media in depression
	screening, especially in online setting.},

	could be used to individualize rehabilitation interventions thus

	timeconsuming. Wearable sensors could be relied upon to address this
	issue. Sensor data could be unobtrusively gathered during the performance
	of motor tasks. Features extracted from the sensor data could provide
	the input to models designed to estimate the severity of motor impairments
	and functional limitations. In previous work, we showed that wearable
	sensor data collected during the performance of items of the Wolf
	Motor Function Test (a clinical scale designed to assess functional
	capability) can be used to estimate scores derived using the Functional
	Ability Scale, a clinical scale focused on quality of movement. The
	purpose of the study herein presented was to investigate whether
	the same dataset could be used to estimate clinical scores derived
	using the Fugl-Meyer Assessment scale (a clinical scale designed
	to assess motor impairments). Our results showed that Fugl-Meyer
	Assessment Test scores can be estimated by feeding a Random Forest
	with features derived from wearable sensor data recorded during the
	performance of as few as a single item of the Wolf Motor Function
	Test. Estimates achieved using the proposed method were marked by
	a root mean squared error as low as 4.7 points of the Fugl-Meyer
	Assessment Test scale.},

	of wearable sensor systems for continuous health monitoring in the
	home and community settings. One of the main areas of application
	for these wearable sensor systems is in detecting emergency events
	such as falls. Wearable sensors like accelerometers are increasingly
	being used to monitor daily activities of individuals at a risk of
	falls, detect emergency events and send alerts to caregivers. However,
	such systems tend to have a high rate of false alarms, which leads
	to low compliance levels. Home robots can enable caregivers with
	the ability to quickly make an assessment and intervene if an emergency
	event is detected. This can provide an additional layer for detecting
	false positives, which can lead to improve compliance. In this paper,
	we present preliminary work on the development of a fall detection
	system based on a combination sensor networks and home robots. The
	sensor network architecture comprises of body worn sensors and ambient
	sensors distributed in the environment. We present the software architecture
	and conceptual design home robotic platform. We also perform preliminary
	characterization of the sensor network in terms of latencies and

	issue in building a pervasive and smart environment. In dealing with

	hierarchical organization of the activities and their typical duration.
	To this end, we introduce the Switching Hidden Semi-Markov Model
	(S-HSMM), a two-layered extension of the hidden semi-Markov model
	(HSMM) for the modeling task. Activities are modeled in the S-HSMM
	in two ways: the bottom layer represents atomic activities and their
	duration using HSMMs; the top layer represents a sequence of high-level
	activities where each high-level activity is made of a sequence of
	atomic activities. We consider two methods for modeling duration:
	the classic explicit duration model using multinomial distribution,
	and the novel use of the discrete Coxian distribution. In addition,
	we propose an effective scheme to detect abnormality without the
	need for training on abnormal data. Experimental results show that
	the S-HSMMperforms better than existing models including the flat
	HSMM and the hierarchical hidden Markov model in both classification
	and abnormality detection tasks, alleviating the need for presegmented
	training data. Furthermore, our discrete Coxian duration model yields
	better computation time and generalization error than the classic
	explicit duration model.},

  abstract = {A challenge in building pervasive and smart spaces is to learn and
	recognize human activities of daily living (ADLs). In this paper,
	we address this problem and argue that in dealing with ADLs, it is
	beneficial to exploit both their typical duration patterns and inherent
	hierarchical structures. We exploit efficient duration modeling using
	the novel Coxian distribution to form the Coxian hidden semi-Markov
	model (CxHSMM) and apply it to the problem of learning and recognizing
	ADLs with complex temporal dependencies. The Coxian duration model
	has several advantages over existing duration parameterization using
	multinomial or exponential family distributions, including its denseness
	in the space of non-negative distributions, low number of parameters,
	computational efficiency and the existence of closed-form estimation
	solutions. Further we combine both hierarchical and duration extensions
	of the hidden Markov model (HMM) to form the novel switching hidden
	semi-Markov model (SHSMM), and empirically compare its performance
	with existing models. The model can learn what an occupant normally
	does during the day from unsegmented training data and then perform
	online activity classification, segmentation and abnormality detection.
	Experimental results show that Coxian modeling outperform a range
	of baseline models for the task of activity segmentation. We also
	achieve a recognition accuracy competitive to the current state-of-the-art
	multinomial duration model, whilst gain a significant reduction in
	computation. Furthermore, cross-validation model selection on the
	number of phases K in the Coxian indicates that only a small K is
	required to achieve the optimal performance. Finally, our models
	are further tested in a more challenging setting in which the tracking
	is often lost and the set of activities considerably overlap. With
	a small amount of labels supplied during training in a partially
	supervised learning mode, our models are again able to deliver reliable
	performance, again with a small number of phases, making our proposed
	framework an attractive choice for activity modeling.},

  abstract = {The diagnosis of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is on
	the rise and it is well-known that early intervention is critical.
	However, there often exists a long gap of waiting and wasting time
	for and between a âformalâ? diagnosis and therapy. The aim of
	TOBY Playpad (www.tobyplaypad.com) is to close this gap by empowering
	parents to help their children early and naturally at home and in
	their daily activities. The current form of TOBY is an iPad application
	that provides an adaptive syllabus of more than 200 activities developed
	by autism and machine learning experts to target key development
	areas which are known to be deficit for ASD children such as imitation,
	joint attention and language. TOBY delivers lessons, materials, instructions
	and interactions for both on-iPad and Natural Environment Tasks (NET)
	off-iPad activities. Since each child is different, TOBY is highly
	adaptive and personalized, intelligently increasing its complexity,
	varying prompts and reinforcements as the child progresses over time.
	Prompting and reinforcing strategies are also recommended for parents
	to make the most of everyday opportunities to teach children. Essentially,
	TOBY removes the burden on parents from extensive preparation of
	materials and manual data recording. We have conducted two trials
	on 20 and 50 children with AutismWest (www.autismwest.org.au) since
	last year. The results are promising providing evidence of learning
	shown in skills that were not present previously in some children.
	NET activities are shown to be effective for children and popular
	with parents. },

  abstract = {Wearable inertial systems have recently been used to track human movement
	in and outside of the laboratory. Continuous monitoring of human
	movement can provide valuable information relevant to individualâs
	level of physical activity and functional ability. Traditionally,
	orientation has been calculated by integrating the angular velocity
	from gyroscopes. However, a small drift in the measured velocity
	leads to large integration errors that grow with time. To compensate
	for that drift, complementary data from accelerometers are normally
	fused into the tracking systems using the Kalman or extended Kalman
	filter (EKF). In this study, we combine kinematic models designed
	for control of robotic arms with the unscented Kalman filter (UKF)
	to continuously estimate the angles of human shoulder and elbow using
	two wearable sensors. This methodology can easily be generalized
	to track other human joints. We validate the method with an optical
	motion tracking system and demonstrate correlation consistently greater
	than 0.9 between the two systems.},

  abstract = {Objective:Ã¢â¬â To provide a detailed picture of the extent, nature
	and quality of portrayal of mental health/illness in Australian non-fiction
	media.Method:Ã¢â¬â Media items were retrieved from Australian
	newspaper, television and radio sources over a 1-year period, and
	identifying/descriptive data extracted from all items. Quality ratings
	were made on a randomly selected 10% of items, using an instrument
	based on criteria in Achieving the Balance (a resource designed to
	promote responsible reporting of mental health/illness).Results:Ã¢â¬â
	Reporting of mental health/illness was common, with 4351 newspaper,
	1237 television and 7801 radio items collected during the study period.
	Media items most frequently focused on policy/program initiatives
	in mental health (29.0%), or on causes/symptoms/treatment of mental
	illnesses (23.9%). Stories about mental health issues in the context
	of crime were relatively uncommon, accounting for only 5.6% of items.
	Most media items were of good quality on eight of the nine dimensions;
	the exception was that details of appropriate help services were
	only included in 6.4% of items.Conclusions:Ã¢â¬â In contrast to
	previous research, the current study found that media reporting of
	mental health/illness was extensive, generally of good quality and
	focused less on themes of crime and violence than may have been expected.
	This is encouraging, since there is evidence that negative media
	portrayal of mental health/illness can detrimentally affect community
	attitudes. However, there are still opportunities for improving media
	reporting of mental health/illness, which should be taken up in future
	media strategies.},

	is important for processing sensory signals and detecting patterns
	in data. Such "exemplars" can be found by randomly choosing an initial

	only works well if that initial choice is close to a good solution.
	We describe a new method called "affinity propagation," which takes
	as input measures of similarity between pairs of data points. Real-valued
	messages are exchanged between data points until a high-quality set
	of exemplars and corresponding clusters gradually emerges. We used
	affinity propagation to cluster images of faces, detect genes in
	microarray data, identify representative sentences in this manuscript
	and identify cities that are efficiently accessed by airline travel.
	Affinity propagation found clusters with much lower error than those
	found by other methods, and it did so in less than one-hundredth
	the amount of time.},

  abstract = {Modelling is fundamental to many fields of science and engineering.
	A model can be thought of as a representation of possible data one
	could predict from a system. The probabilistic approach to modelling
	uses probability theory to express all aspects of uncertainty in
	the model. The probabilistic approach is synonymous with Bayesian
	modelling, which simply uses the rules of probability theory in order
	to make predictions, compare alternative models, and learn model
	parameters and structure from data. This simple and elegant framework
	is most powerful when coupled with flexible probabilistic models.
	Flexibility is achieved through the use of Bayesian nonparametrics.
	This article provides an overview of probabilistic modelling and
	an accessible survey of some of the main tools in Bayesian nonparametrics.
	The survey covers the use of Bayesian nonparametrics for modelling
	unknown functions, density estimation, clustering, time series modelling,
	and representing sparsity, hierarchies, and covariance structure.
	More specifically it gives brief non-technical overviews of Gaussian
	processes, Dirichlet processes, infinite hidden Markov models, Indian
	buffet processes, Kingman's coalescent, Dirichlet diffusion tress,
	and Wishart processes.},

	contrast with the random trajectories predicted by the prevailing
	LÃ©vy flight and random walk models7, human trajectories show a high
	degree of temporal and spatial regularity, each individual being
	characterized by a time-independent characteristic travel distance
	and a significant probability to return to a few highly frequented
	locations. After correcting for differences in travel distances and
	the inherent anisotropy of each trajectory, the individual travel
	patterns collapse into a single spatial probability distribution,
	indicating that, despite the diversity of their travel history, humans
	follow simple reproducible patterns. This inherent similarity in
	travel patterns could impact all phenomena driven by human mobility,

	stabilized using a feature graph derived from two types of EMR structures:
	temporal structure of disease and intervention recurrences, and hierarchical

	failure patients. On two stability measures â the Jaccard index

	increased feature stability without hurting discriminative power.

  abstract = {Multimedia content understanding research requires rigorous approach
	to deal with the complexity of the data. At the crux of this problem
	is the method to deal with multilevel data whose structure exists
	at multiple scales and across data sources. A common example is modeling
	tags jointly with images to improve retrieval, classification and
	tag recommendation. Associated contextual observation, such as metadata,
	is rich that can be exploited for content analysis. A major challenge
	is the need for a principal approach to systematically incorporate
	associated media with the primary data source of interest. Taking
	a factor modeling approach, we propose a framework that can discover
	low-dimensional structures for a primary data source together with
	other associated information. We cast this task as a subspace learning
	problem under the framework of Bayesian nonparametrics and thus the
	subspace dimensionality and the number of clusters are automatically
	learnt from data instead of setting these parameters a priori. Using
	Beta processes as the building block, we construct random measures
	in a hierarchical structure to generate multiple data sources and
	capture their shared statistical at the same time. The model parameters
	are inferred efficiently using a novel combination of Gibbs and slice

	in predicting clinical outcomes. Setting. A regional cancer centre
	in Australia. Participants Disease-specific data from a purpose-built
	cancer registry (Evaluation of Cancer Outcomes (ECO)) from 869 patients
	were used to predict survival at 6, 12 and 24âmonths. The model
	was validated with data from a further 94 patients, and results compared
	to the assessment of five specialist oncologists. Machine-learning
	prediction using ECO data was compared with that using EAR and a
	model combining ECO and EAR data. Primary and secondary outcome measures
	Survival prediction accuracy in terms of the area under the receiver
	operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results. The ECO model yielded
	AUCs of 0.87 (95% CI 0.848 to 0.890) at 6âmonths, 0.796 (95% CI
	0.774 to 0.823) at 12âmonths and 0.764 (95% CI 0.737 to 0.789)
	at 24âmonths. Each was slightly better than the performance of
	the clinician panel. The model performed consistently across a range
	of cancers, including rare cancers. Combining ECO a and EAR data
	yielded better prediction than the ECO-based model (AUCs ranging
	from 0.757 to 0.997 for 6âmonths, AUCs from 0.689 to 0.988 for

	prediction was for genitourinary, head and neck, lung, skin, andupper
	gastrointestinal tumours. Conclusions. Machine learning applied to
	information from a disease-specific (cancer) database and the EAR
	can be used to predict clinical outcomes. Importantly, the approach
	described made use of digital data that is already routinely collected

  abstract = {Medical electronic systems are generating ever larger data sets from
	a variety of sensors and devices. Such systems are also being packaged
	in wearable designs for easy and broad use. The large volume of data
	and the constraints of low-power, extended-duration, and wireless
	monitoring impose the need for on-chip processing to distill clinically
	relevant information from the raw data. The higher-level information,
	rather than the raw data, is what needs to be transmitted. We present
	one example of information processing for continuous, high-sampling-rate
	data collected from wearable and portable devices. A wearable cardiac
	and motion monitor designed by colleagues at MIT simultaneously records
	electrocardiogram (ECG) and 3-axis acceleration to onboard memory,
	in an ambulatory setting. The acceleration data is used to generate
	a continuous estimate of physical activity. Additionally, we use
	a Portapres continuous blood pressure monitor to concurrently record
	the arterial blood pressure (ABP) waveform. To help reduce noise,
	which is an increased challenge in ambulatory monitoring, we use
	both the ECG and ABP waveforms to generate a robust measure of heart
	rate from noisy data. We also generate an overall signal abnormality
	index to aid in the interpretation of the results. Two important
	cardiovascular quantities, namely cardiac output (CO) and total peripheral
	resistance (TPR), are then derived from this data over a sequence
	of physical activities. CO and TPR can be estimated (to within a
	scale factor) from heart rate, pulse pressure and mean arterial blood
	pressure, which in turn are directly obtained from the ECG and ABP
	signals. Data was collected on 10 healthy subjects. The derived quantities
	vary in a manner that is consistent with known physiology. Further
	work remains to correlate these values with the cardiac health state.},

  abstract = {Natural language processing employs computational techniques for the
	purpose of learning, understanding, and producing human language
	content. Early computational approaches to language research focused
	on automating the analysis of the linguistic structure of language
	and developing basic technologies such as machine translation, speech
	recognition, and speech synthesis. Todayâs researchers refine and
	make use of such tools in real-world applications, creating spoken
	dialogue systems and speech-to-speech translation engines, mining
	social media for information about health or finance, and identifying
	sentiment and emotion toward products and services. We describe successes
	and challenges in this rapidly advancing area.},

	tree structure using Tree-Lasso},
  journal = {Biomedical Informatics},
  year = {2015},
  pages = {accepted on 28 Nov. 2014},
  abstract = {Modern healthcare is getting reshaped by growing electronic medical
	records (EMR). Recently, these records have been shown of great value
	towards building clinical prediction models. In EMR data, patientsâ
	diseases and hospital interventions are captured through a set of
	diagnoses and procedures codes. These codes are usually represented
	in a tree form (e.g. ICD-10 tree) and the codes within a tree branch
	may be highly correlated. These codes can be used as features to
	build a prediction model and an appropriate feature selection can
	inform a clinician about important risk factors for a disease. Traditional
	feature selection methods (e.g. Information Gain, T-test, etc) consider
	each variable independently and usually end up having a long feature
	list. Recently, Lasso and related l1-penalty based feature selection
	methods have become popular due to their joint feature selection
	property. However, Lasso is known to have problems of selecting one
	feature of many correlated features randomly. This hinders the clinicians
	to arrive at a stable feature set, which is crucial for clinical
	decision making process. In this paper, we solve this problem by
	using a recently proposed Tree-Lasso model. Since, the stability
	behavior of Tree-Lasso is not well understood, we study the stability
	behavior of Tree-Lasso and compare it with other feature selection
	methods. Using a synthetic and two real-world datasets (Cancer and
	Acute Myocardial Infarction), we show that Tree-Lasso based feature
	selection is significantly more stable than Lasso and comparable
	to other methods e.g. Information Gain, ReliefF and T-test. We further
	show that, using different types of classifiers such as logistic
	regression, naive Bayes, support vector machines, decision trees
	and Random Forest, the classification performance of Tree-Lasso iscomparable
	to Lasso and better than other methods. Our result has implications
	in identifying stable risk factors for many healthcareproblems and
	therefore can potentially assist clinical decision making for accurate
	medical prognosis.},

  abstract = {We present an investigation into the problem of robust wifi localization
	using received signal strength. Various RF based probablistic wifi
	localization model has been developed that uses fingerprinting for
	location determination. But often they are too complicated and dependent
	on user's information and infrastructural information. We proposed
	three models which also takes into account that access points (APs)
	are randomly distributed, for developing the robust model which is
	simple, faster, generic, independent of user's information and can
	also withstand the infrastructural change. These models are naive
	Bayes classifier and it's modification . We used two techniques sampling
	Boolean matrix for utilizing the temporal spatial constraints respectively.
	To the best of our knowledge it is the first time anyone has used
	the boolean matrix to utilize the spatial constraints without the
	user information. Use of sampling gives us flexibility of varying
	sampling period to obtain delicate balance between latency and robustness.
	We employed confusion matrix and ranking statistics to analyse the
	performance of the classifier. Implementation of method shows that
	we can obtain accuracy up to 92.4\% and 98.6\% respectively for rank
	1 and rank 2 classifier with a sampling period of 2s},

	and 22% of arm swing angles. For analysis we use One-way ANOVA and
	K-mean clustering to indentify the most significant features and
	to partition four different motion constrained groups. Our experimental
	result shows that all four arm constraints during walking motion
	are clustered with an average accuracy of 91.7% on two different
	feature conditions: a mixture of singular value decomposition (SVD)
	and power spectral density (PSD); and SVD only on selected gait cycles.
	The proposed method can be integrated with a ubiquitous system (using
	wearable sensors) for a remote distance patient monitoring system

	and gender. The analysis presented is based on a dataset of over
	58,000 volunteers who provided their Facebook Likes, detailed demographic
	profiles, and the results of several psychometric tests. The proposed
	model uses dimensionality reduction for preprocessing the Likes data,
	which are then entered into logistic/linear regression to predict
	individual psychodemographic profiles from Likes. The model correctly
	discriminates between homosexual and heterosexual men in 88% of cases,
	African Americans and Caucasian Americans in 95% of cases, and between
	Democrat and Republican in 85% of cases. For the personality trait
	âOpenness,â? prediction accuracy is close to the testâretest
	accuracy of a standard personality test. We give examples of associations
	between attributes and Likes and discuss implications for online
	personalization and privacy.},

	2013)},
  year = {2013},
  address = {San Jose, California, USA},
  month = {July, 2013},
  abstract = {Multimedia contents often possess weakly annotated data such as tags,
	links and interactions. The weakly annotated data is called side
	information. It is the auxiliary information of data and provides
	hints for exploring the link structure of data. Most clustering algorithms
	utilize pure data for clustering. A model that combines pure data
	and side information, such as images and tags, documents and keywords,
	can perform better at understanding the underlying structure of data.
	We demonstrate how to incorporate different types of side information
	into a recently proposed Bayesian non-parametric model, the distance
	dependent Chinese restaurant process (DD-CRP). Our algorithm embeds
	the affinity of this information into the decay function of the DD-CRP
	when side information is in the form of subsets of discrete labels.
	It is flexible to measure distance based on arbitrary side information
	instead of only the spatial layout or time stamp of observations.
	At the same time, for noisy and incomplete side information, we set
	the decay function so that the DD-CRP reduces to the traditional
	Chinese restaurant process, thus not inducing side effects of noisy
	and incomplete side information. Experimental evaluations on two
	real-world datasets NUS_WIDE and 20 Newsgroups show exploiting side
	information in DD-CRP significantly improves the clustering performance.},

  abstract = {Abstract--- We propose a novel hierarchical Bayesian framework, word-distance-dependent
	Chinese restaurant franchise (wddCRF) for topic discovery from a
	document corpus regularized by side information in the form of word-to-word
	relations, with an application on Electronic Medical Records (EMRs).
	Typically, a EMRs dataset consists of several patients (documents)
	and each patient contains many diagnosis codes (words). We exploit
	the side information available in the form of a semantic tree structure
	among the diagnosis codes for semantically-coherent disease topic
	discovery. We introduce novel functions to compute word-to-word distances
	when side information is available in the form of tree structures.
	We derive an efficient inference method for the wddCRF using MCMC
	technique. We evaluate on a real world medical dataset consisting
	of about 1000 patients with PolyVascular disease. Compared with the
	popular topic analysis tool, hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP),
	our model discovers topics which are superior in terms of both qualitative
	and quantitative measure.},

	the Facebook (www.facebook.com) and Twitter (www.twitter.com) groups.
	We used four assessment criteria: (1) purpose, (2) type of creator,
	(3) telehealth content, and (4) free-text responses in surveys and
	interviews. We observed a total of 357 Parkinson groups, 325 dementia
	groups, 853 Alzheimer groups, and 1127 depression groups on Facebook
	and Twitter. Moreover, we analyze the responses provided by different
	users. The survey and interview responses showed that many people
	were interested in using social networks to support and help in the
	fight against these diseases. The results indicate that social networks
	are acceptable by users in terms of simplicity and utility. People
	use them for finding support, information, self-help, advocacy and
	awareness, and for collecting funds.},

	Methods: Participants were 33 families with a child with an ASD aged
	16 years or less, and with a diagnosis of Autism or Pervasive Developmental
	Disorder â Not Otherwise Specified, and no secondary diagnoses.
	Families were provided with TOBY and asked to use it for four to
	six weeks, without further prompting or coaching. Dependent variables
	included participant use patterns and initial indicators of child
	progress. Results: Twenty-three participants engaged extensively
	with TOBY, being exposed to at least 100 complete learn units (CLUs)
	and completing between 17% and 100% of the curriculum. Conclusions:
	TOBY may make a useful contribution to early intervention programming
	for children with ASD delivering high rates of appropriate learning
	opportunities. Further research evaluating the efficacy of TOBY in
	relation to independent indicators of functioning is warranted.},

  abstract = {Until recently, many gait studies explored potential gait alteration
	due to various disorders in the gait lab and using camera based systems
	and force platforms. However, these strategies may not replicate
	normal outdoor walking. Using this equipment, it is more difficult
	to measure the variability of walking which is important for maintaining
	balance and responding to different walking challenges. Additionally,
	subjects may mask their problem or exaggerate it when they are walking
	in a short walking distance offered by laboratory based-technology.
	This study overviews some of the key advantages of wearable technology
	compared to laboratory-based instrument. Additionally, it explored
	gait patterns over ample distance of walking compared to walking
	distance restricted to a gait laboratory environment. Walking patterns
	of ten healthy young subjects were examined using a wearable sensor
	technology in a random order over a distance of 7m, 14m, and 20m.
	Results suggest that participants walk significantly faster by increasing
	walking distance on average by 15% and 3% when walking distance was
	increased respectively from 7m to 14 and from 14m to 20m (p<0.05).
	Interestingly despite a high test-retest reliability for averaged
	gait parameters (ICC>0.89), the test-retest reliability for gait
	variability was only acceptable during 20m walking distance (ICC<0.3
	for 7m and 14m v. ICC=0.65 for 20m). Taken together, our findings
	indicate that for valid and reliable assessment of gait parameters,
	gait should be performed over ample walking distances. Body worn
	sensor technology facilitates assessing gait outside of a gait laboratory,
	over ample walking distance, different footwear condition, different
	walking surface, and in environment where mimics better true environment
	where the subject is active},

	that to robustly model and recognize complex human activities, it
	is crucial to exploit both the natural hierarchical decomposition
	and shared semantics embedded in the movement trajectories. To this
	end, we propose the use of the HHMM, a rich stochastic model that
	has been recently extended to handle shared structures, for representing
	and recognizing a set of complex indoor activities. Furthermore,
	in the need of real-time recognition, we propose a Rao-Blackwellised
	particle filter (RBPF) that efficiently computes the filtering distribution
	at a constant time complexity for each new observation arrival. The
	main contributions of this paper lie in the application of the sharedstructure
	HHMM, the estimation of the model's parameters at all levels simultaneously,
	and a construction of an RBPF approximate inference scheme. The experimental
	results in a real-world environment have confirmed our belief that
	directly modeling shared structures not only reduces computational
	cost, but also improves recognition accuracy when compared with the
	tree HHMM and the flat HMM.},

	achieved when classifying among social capital groups using topic

	the blogosphere as a framework to study user psychological behaviours,
	using their sentiment responses as a form of âsensorâ to infer
	real-world events of importance automatically. We formulate a novel
	temporal sentiment index function using quantitative measure of the
	valence value of bearing words in blog posts in which the set of
	affective bearing words is inspired from psychological research in
	emotion structure. The annual local minimum and maximum of the proposed
	sentiment signal function are utilized to extract significant events
	of the year and corresponding blog posts are further analyzed using
	topic modelling tools to understand their content. The paper then
	examines the correlation of topics discovered in relation to world
	news events reported by the mainstream news service provider, Cable
	News Network (CNN), and by using the Google search engine. Next,
	aiming at understanding sentiment at a finer granularity over time,
	we propose a stochastic burst detection model, extended from the
	work of Kleinberg, to work incrementally with stream data. The proposed
	model is then used to extract sentimental bursts occurring within
	a specific mood label (for example, a burst of observing âshockedâ).
	The blog posts at those time indices are analyzed to extract topics
	and these are compared to real-world news events. Our comprehensive
	set of experiments conducted on a large-scale set of 12 million posts
	from Livejournal shows that the proposed sentiment index (SI) function
	coincides well with significant world events while bursts in sentiment
	allow us to locate finer-grain external world events.}

	Traditional parametric modeling approaches from machine learning

  abstract = {Exploiting context from stream data in pervasive environments remains
	a challenge. We aim to extract proximal context from Bluetooth stream
	data, using an incremental, Bayesian nonparametric framework that
	estimates the number of contexts automatically. Unlike current approaches
	that can only provide final proximal grouping, our method provides
	proximal grouping and membership of users over time. Additionally,
	it provides an efficient online inference. We construct co-location
	matrix over time using Bluetooth data. A Poisson-exponential model
	is used to factorize this matrix into a factor matrix, interpreted
	as proximal groups, and a coefficient matrix that indicates factor
	usage. The coefficient matrix follows the Indian Buffet Process prior,
	which estimates the number of factors automatically. The non-negativity
	and sparsity of factors are enforced by using the exponential distribution
	to generate the factors. We propose a fixed-lag particle filter algorithm
	to process data incrementally. We compare the incremental inference
	(particle filter) with full batch inference (Gibbs sampling) in terms
	of normalized factorization error and execution time. The normalized
	error obtained through our incremental inference is comparable to
	that of full batch inference, whilst it is more than 100 times faster.
	The discovered factors have similar meaning to the results of the
	Louvain method â a popular method for community detection.},

  abstract = {A fundamental task in pervasive computing is reliable acquisition
	of contexts from sensor data. This is crucial to the operation of
	smart pervasive systems and services so that they might behave efficiently
	and appropriately upon a given context. Simple forms of context can
	often be extracted directly from raw data. Equally important, or
	more, is the hidden context and pattern buried inside the data, which
	is more challenging to discover. Most of existing approaches borrow
	methods and techniques from machine learning, dominantly employ parametric
	unsupervised learning and clustering techniques. Being parametric,
	a severe drawback of these methods is the requirement to specify
	the number of latent patterns in advance. In this paper, we explore
	the use of Bayesian nonparametric methods, a recent data modelling
	framework in machine learning, to infer latent patterns from sensor
	data acquired in a pervasive setting. Under this formalism, nonparametric
	prior distributions are used for data generative process, and thus,
	they allow the number of latent patterns to be learned automatically
	and grow with the data - as more data comes in, the model complexity
	can grow to explain new and unseen patterns. In particular, we make
	use of the hierarchical Dirichlet processes (HDP) to infer atomic
	activities and interaction patterns from honest signals collected
	from sociometric badges. We show how data from these sensors can
	be represented and learned with HDP. We illustrate insights into
	atomic patterns learned by the model and use them to achieve high-performance
	clustering. We also demonstrate the framework on the popular Reality
	Mining dataset, illustrating the ability of the model to automatically
	infer typical social groups in this dataset. Finally, our framework
	is generic and applicable to a much wider range of problems in pervasive
	computing where one needs to infer high-level, latent patterns and
	contexts from sensor data.},

  abstract = {Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) are an important class of latent
	variable models for representing vector data. An under-explored area
	is multimode data, where each data point is a matrix or a tensor.
	Standard RBMs applying to such data would require vectorizing matrices
	and tensors, thus resulting in unnecessarily high dimensionality
	and at the same time, destroying the inherent higher-order interaction
	structures. This paper introduces Tensor-variate Restricted Boltzmann
	Machines (TvRBMs) which generalize RBMs to capture the multiplicative
	interaction between data modes and the latent variables. TvRBMs are
	highly compact in that the number of free parameters grows only linear
	with the number of modes. We demonstrate the capacity of TvRBMs on
	three real-world applications: handwritten digit classification,
	face recognition and EEG-based alcoholic diagnosis. The learnt features

	in unsupervised settings. However, when it comes to parts-based discovery,
	RBMs do not usually produce satisfactory results. We enhance such
	capacity of RBMs by introducing nonnegativity into the model weights,

	(NMF), and the thematic features uncovered from text are qualitatively

  abstract = {The performance of image retrieval depends critically on the semantic

	semantics of interest (e.g., concepts). As the distance function
	operates on the representation, they are interdependent, and thus
	should be addressed at the same time. We propose a probabilistic
	solution to learn both the representation from multiple feature types
	and modalities and the distance metric from data. The learning is
	regularised so that the learned representation and information-theoretic
	metric will (i) preserve the regularities of the visual/textual spaces,
	(ii) enhance structured sparsity, (iii) encourage small intra-concept
	distances, and (iv) keep inter-concept images separated. We demonstrate

	On the subset of single-concept images, we gain 79:5% improvement

  title = {Infinite-Dimensional Exponential Families in Cluster Analysis of
	Structured Data},
  school = {University of Zurich},
  year = {2008},
  abstract = {The principal focus of the present thesis is the cluster analysis
	of structured data, in particular with spatial and temporal coupling
	structure, and with ordinal structure of individual observations.
	The thesis studies grouping models and algorithms which (i) take
	into account structure such as spatial and temporal smoothness and
	(ii) estimate or select the model order, or number of clusters, from
	the data. Applications include segmentation of image and remote sensing
	data, video sequences, and cluster analysis of rank data. For the
	cluster analysis of ordinal data, we introduce a mixture model suitable
	for the simultaneous representation of partial rankings of diferent
	lengths. Unlike grouping models for ordinal data previously available
	in the literature, the model permits the analysis of heterogeneous
	data sets. For segment analysis of noisy image data, we show that
	nonparametric Bayesian mixture models can be combined with Markov
	random fields. The resulting class of models simultaneously estimates
	the model order and a segmentation of the image, under a smoothness
	constraint on the segment solution. Video sequences exhibit a temporal
	dependence structure, similar to spatial coupling in still images.
	A sequence model of conditional Dirichlet processes is proposed,
	based on the conjugate nature of the Dirichlet process, which estimates
	cluster structure evolving over time. By conditioning on a previous
	estimate, such methods perform model order adaptation rather than
	model order selection. Based on the observation that the Dirichlet
	process inherits a number of key properties from its finite-dimensional
	marginals, we study the general construction of innite-dimensional
	(\nonparametric") Bayesian models. It is shown that innite-dimensional
	conjugate models are generated as projective limits of nite-dimensional
	conjugate models, in particular of those with exponential family
	components. An extension theorem for conditional measures and general
	construction criteria are given, and suficiency and conjugacy properties
	of nite-dimensional Bayesian models are shown to be preserved under
	extension to the infinite-dimensional case.},

  abstract = {When one considers realistic multimodal data, covariates are rich,
	and yet tend to have a natural correlation with one another; for
	example: tags and their associated multimedia contents; patient's
	demographic information, medical history and drug usage; social user's
	prole and friendship network. The presence of rich and naturally
	correlated covariates calls for the need to model their correlation
	with nonparametric models, without reverting to making parametric
	assumptions. This paper presents a full Bayesian nonparametric approach
	to the problem of jointly clustering data sources and modeling their
	correlation. In our approach, we view context as distributions over
	some index space, governed by the topics discovered from the primary
	data source (content), and model both contents and contexts jointly.
	We impose a conditional structure in which contents provide the topics,
	upon which contexts are conditionally distributed. Distributions
	over topic parameters are modelled according to a Dirichlet processes
	(DP). Stick-breaking representation gives rise to explicit realizations
	of topic atoms which we use as an indexing mechanism to induce conditional
	random mixture distributions on the context observation spaces. Loosely
	speaking, we use a stochastic process, being DP, to conditionally
	`index' other stochastic processes. The later can be designed on
	any suitable family of stochastic processes to suit modelling needs
	or data types of contexts (such as Beta or Gaussian processes). Dirichlet
	process is of course an obvious choice and will be again employed
	in this work. In typical hierarchical Bayesian style, we also provide
	the model in grouped data setting, where contents and contexts appear
	in groups (for example, a collection of text documents or images
	embedded in time or space). Our model can be viewed as a generalization
	of the hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) [2] and the recent nested
	Dirichlet process (nDP) [1]. We develop an auxiliary conditional
	Gibbs sampling in which both topic and context atoms are marginalized
	out. We demonstrate the framework on synthesis datasets and various
	real large-scale datasets with an emphasis on the application perspective
	of the models. In particular, we demonstrate a) an application in
	text modelling for modelling topics which are sensitive to time using
	the NIPS and PNAS dataset, b) an application of the model in computer
	vision for inferring local and global movement patterns using the
	MIT dataset consisting of real video data collected at a trac scene,
	c) an application on medical data analysis in which we model latent
	aspects of diseases, their progression together with the task of

  title = {Probabilistic and Film Grammar Based Methods for Video Content Analysis},
  school = {Curtin University of Technology, Australia},
  year = {2005},
  abstract = {In the last decade, we have truly entered the information age with
	an explosion in the amount of digital data produced every day. The
	growing complexity and inadequacy of existing tools for managing
	this data proliferation have highlighted the need for better tools
	and techniques. Towards this end, this thesis aims at exploring Film
	Grammar and formal probabilistic models for video content analysis,
	in which the educational videos are used as the domain of investigation.
	To utilise Film Grammar, we base our work in a Computational Media
	Aesthetics framework as a systematic way of harnessing film theory
	in seeking meaningful descriptors. We study the aspects of `grammars'
	that are peculiar to the educational genre to uncover the nature
	of semantics and structural information presented. In our initial
	study, a hierarchy of narrative structural units for this video genre
	is proposed and automatically recognised. The hierarchy is learned
	using a set of features extracted from audio and visual streams.
	The experimental results demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed
	hierarchy. Next, we exploit film theory to extract {\em expressive}
	elements, computed from low-level features, that are useful for educational
	videos. First, we examine the {\em content density} function as a
	measure of the `rate of information delivered', study its key contributing
	factors and propose a computational form for it. Observing that a
	drop or rise in this function reflects important clues about the
	structure of the video, we propose heuristic and probabilistic algorithms
	for the detection of subtopic boundaries. We then advance this study
	with the extraction of the {\em dramatic} and {\em thematic} functions.
	The thematic function reflects the `instructional' or `informative'
	portions in the video where the video-maker decides to interfere
	in the subject matter being presented. The dramatic function, on
	the other hand, provides information about the `dramatisation level'
	of the video, such as a film segment where an event is dramatised.
	Combining information from the content density and thematic functions
	allows us to further segment an educational video into a two-level
	hierarchy of topical content, namely at main topic and subtopic levels.
	In seeking formal probabilistic models, our key observation is that
	semantic concepts in the video domain possess a natural hierarchical
	decomposition, and more noticeably there is {\em tight} inheritance
	of semantics in the hierarchy. Here, we theoretically extend the
	tree-structure Hierarchical Hidden Markov Models (\HHMM) in~\citep{FINE_EL-98}
	to allow arbitrary sharing at any level in the topology of the model.
	We show how the exact inference and learning can be done in this
	general case with the same complexity as in~\citep{FINE_EL-98}. To
	deal with long observation sequences, we propose a novel scaling
	algorithm to avoid numerical underflow. In addition, we also propose
	a new generalised Viterbi algorithm and address the issue of continuous
	observations for this model. Following the theoretical extension
	to the HHMM, we present two applications exploiting the expressiveness
	of shared structures in the HHMM for the problem of semantic analysis
	and segmentation in educational videos. First, it is shown that subtopic
	boundary transitions can be detected in this framework. Second, we
	show that useful narrative structures can be learned automatically
	with the HHMM. In both applications, the domain knowledge is utilised
	as prior information to construct the topology of the HHMM.},

	is now the norm. Whilst social capital and its impact on social networks
	has been examined, its underlying connection to emotional response
	such as mood, has not been investigated. This paper studies this
	phenomena, revisiting the concept of âonline social capitalâ?
	in social media communities using measurable aspects of social participation
	and social support. We establish the link between online capital
	derived from social media and mood, demonstrating results for different
	cohorts of social capital and social connectivity. We use novel Bayesian
	nonparametric factor analysis to extract the shared and individual
	factors in mood transition across groups of users of different levels
	of connectivity, quantifying patterns and degree of mood transitions.
	Using more than 1.6 million users from LiveJournal, we show quantitatively
	that groups with lower social capital have fewer positive moods and
	more negative moods, than groups with higher social capital. We show
	similar effects in mood transitions. We establish a framework of
	how social media can be used as a barometer for mood. The significance
	lies in the importance of online social capital to mental well-being
	in overall. In establishing the link between mood and social capital
	in online communities, this work may suggest the foundation of new
	systems to monitor online mental well-being.},

	activity (e.g., RFID event of entering a building), learning latent

	at a desk, meeting with people or gathering with friends, remains
	a challenging problem. Supervised learning has been the typical modeling
	choice in the past. However, this requires labeled training data,
	is unable to predict never-seen-before activity and fails to adapt

	Bayesian nonparametric method, in particular the Hierarchical Dirichlet
	Process, to infer latent activities from sensor data acquired in
	a pervasive setting. Our framework is unsupervised, requires no labeled
	data and is able to discover new activities as data grows. We present
	experiments on extracting movement and interaction activities from
	sociometric badge signals and show how to use them for detection

  title = {Conditionally Dependent {D}irichlet Processes for Modelling Naturally
	Correlated Data Sources},
  institution = {Pattern Recognition and Data Analytics, Deakin University},
  year = {2012},
  abstract = {Abstract We introduce a new class of conditionally dependent Dirichlet
	processes (CDP) for hierarchical mixture modelling of naturally correlated
	data sources. This class of models provides a Bayesian nonparametric
	approach for modelling a range of challenging datasets which typically
	consists of heterogeneous observations from multiple correlated data
	channels. Some typical examples include annotated social media, networks
	in community where information about friendship and relation coexist
	with user's profiles, medical records where patient's information
	exists in several dimension (demograhic information, medical history,
	drug uses and so on). The proposed framework can easily be tailored
	to model multiple data sources which are correlated by some latent
	underlying processes, whereas most of existing topic models, notably
	hierarchical Dirichlet processes (HDP), is designed for only a single
	data observation channel. In these existing approaches, data are
	grouped into documents (e.g., text documents or they are grouped
	according to some covariates such as time or location). Our approach
	is different: we view context as distributions over some index space
	and model both topics and contexts jointly. Distributions over topic
	parameters are modelled according to the usual Dirichlet processes.
	Stick-breaking representation gives rise to explicit realizations
	of topic atoms which we use as an indexing machemism to induce conditional
	random mixture distributions on the context observation spaces --
	loosely speaking, we use a stochastic process, being DP, to conditionally
	`index' other stochastic processes. The later can be designed on
	any suitable family of stochastic processes to suit modelling needs
	or data types of contexts (such as Beta or Gaussian processes). Dirichlet
	process is of course an obvious choice. Our model can be viewed as
	an integration of the hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) and the
	recent nested Dirichlet process (nDP) with shared mixture components.
	In fact, it provides an interesting interpretation whereas, under
	a suitable parameterization, integrating out the topic components
	results in a nested DP, whereas interating out the context compoenents
	results in a hierarchical DP. Different approaches for posterior
	inference exist. This paper focus on the development of an auxilliary
	conditional Gibbs sampling in which both topic and context atoms
	are marginalized out. We demonstrate the framework on synthesis datasets
	for temporal topic modelling and trajectory discovery in videos surveillances.
	We then demonstrate an application on a current visual category classification
	challenge in computer vision for which we significantly outperform
	the current reported state-of-the-art results. Finally, it is worthwide
	to note that our proposed approach can be easily twisted to accomodate
	different forms of supervision (weakly annotated data, semi-supervision)
	and to perform prediction.},

	Moreover, many existing clustering methods require the user to specify

	proposes a new class of models for data clustering that addresses
	set-valued data as well as unknown number of clusters, using a Dirichlet

	efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo posterior inference technique

  abstract = {Bipolar Disorder is a severe form of mental illness. It is characterized
	by alternated episodes of mania and depression, and it is treated
	typically with a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy.
	Recognizing early warning signs of upcoming phases of mania or depression
	would be of great help for a personalized medical treatment. Unfortunately,
	this is a difficult task to be performed for both patient and doctors.
	In this paper we present the MONARCA wearable system, which is meant
	for recognizing early warning signs and predict maniac or depressive
	episodes. The system is a smartphone-centred and minimally invasive
	wearable sensors network that is being developing in the framework
	of the MONARCA European project.},

	using a joint multinomial+Gaussian Dirichlet process model (DPM).
	Since the multinomial distribution is normalized, the Gaussian mixture
	distinguishes between similar spatial patterns but different activity
	levels (eg. car vs bike). We propose a modification of the decayed
	MCMC technique for incremental inference, providing the ability to
	discover theoretically unlimited patterns in unbounded video streams.
	A promising by-product of our framework is online, abnormal activity
	detection. A benchmark video and two surveillance videos, with the
	longest being 140 hours long are used in our experiments. The patterns
	discovered are as informative as existing scene understanding algorithms.
	However, unlike existing work, we achieve near real-time execution
	and encouraging performance in abnormal activity detection.},

	confronted with small numbers of samples, as in rare medical conditions,
	the task is challenging. We propose a framework for classification
	with data with small numbers of samples. Conceptually our solution
	is a hybrid of multi-task and transfer learning, employing data samples
	from source tasks as in transfer learning, but considering all tasks
	together as in multi-task learning. Each task is modelled jointly
	with other related tasks by directly augmenting the data from other
	tasks. The degree of augmentation depends on the task relatedness
	and is estimated directly from the data. We apply the model on three
	diverse real-world datasets (healthcare data, handwritten digit data
	and face data) and show that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art
	multi-task learning baselines. We extend the model for online multi-task
	learning where the model parameters are incrementally updated given
	new data or new tasks. The novelty of our method lies in offering
	a hybrid multi-task/transfer learning model to exploit sharing across
	tasks at the data-level and joint parameter learning.},

	Existing sparse subspace representation methods are restricted to

	we propose a novel method that regularizes sparse subspace representation
	by exploiting the structural sharing between tasks and data points.
	The first regularizer aims at group level where we seek sparsity
	between groups but dense within group. The second regularizer models
	the interactions down to data point level via the well-known graph
	regularization technique. We also derive simple, provably convergent,
	and extremely computationally efficient algorithms for solving the
	proposed group formulations. We evaluate the proposed methods over
	a wide range of large-scale clustering problems: from challenging
	health care to image and text clustering benchmarks datasets and

	reciprocate their follow requests. From a practical standpoint, this

	This paper describes the development and testing of a tetherless
	ergonomics workstation that is suitable for studying nursesâ physical
	workload in a clinical setting. The workstation uses wearable sensors
	to record multiple channels of body orientation and muscle activity
	and wirelessly transmits them to a base station laptop computer for
	display, storage, and analysis. In preparation for use in a clinical
	setting, the workstation was tested in a laboratory equipped for
	multi-camera video motion analysis. The testing included a pilot
	study of the effect of bed height on student nursesâ physical workload
	while they repositioned a volunteer posing as a bedridden patient
	toward the head of the bed. Each nurse subject chose a preferred
	bed height, and data were recorded, in randomized order, with the
	bed at this height, at 0.1 m below this height, and at 0.1 m above
	this height. The testing showed that the body orientation recordings
	made by the wearable sensors agreed closely with those obtained from
	the video motion analysis system. The pilot study showed the following
	trends: As the bed height was raised, the nursesâ trunk flexion
	at both thoracic and lumbar sites and lumbar muscle effort decreased,
	whereas trapezius and deltoid muscle effort increased. These trends
	will be evaluated by further studies of practicing nurses in the
	clinical setting.},

	Thus learning TBM is essentially learning to make sense of a set

	activity recognition or emergency event detection, especially in
	the case of elderly or disabled people living independently in their
	homes. Several techniques have been proposed for identifying such
	distress situations using either motion, audio or video sensors on
	the monitored subject (wearable sensors) or the surrounding environment.
	The output of such sensors is data streams that require real time
	recognition, especially in emergency situations, thus traditional
	classification approaches may not be applicable for immediate alarm
	triggering or fall prevention. This paper presents a statistical
	mining methodology that may be used for the specific problem of real
	time fall detection. Visual data captured from the userâs environment,
	using overhead cameras along with motion data are collected from
	accelerometers on the subjectâs body and are fed to the fall detection
	system. The paper includes the details of the stream data mining
	methodology incorporated in the system along with an initial evaluation
	of the achieved accuracy in detecting falls.},

	in research on stress, coping resource, coping strategies, and social
	support processes. New directions in research on stressors include
	examining the differing impacts of stress across a range of physical
	and mental health outcomes, the "carry-overs" of stress from one
	role domain or stage of life into another, the benefits derived from
	negative experiences, and the determinants of the meaning of stressors.
	Although a sense of personal control and perceived social support
	influence health and mental health both directly and as stress buffers,
	the theoretical mechanisms through which they do so still require
	elaboration and testing. New work suggests that coping flexibility
	and structural constraints on individuals' coping efforts may be
	important to pursue. Promising new directions in social support research
	include studies of the negative effects of social relationships and
	of support giving, mutual coping and support-giving dynamics, optimal
	"matches" between individuals' needs and support received, and properties
	of groups which can provide a sense of social support. Qualitative
	comparative analysis, optimal matching analysis, and event-structure
	analysis are new techniques which may help advance research in these
	broad topic areas. To enhance the effectiveness of coping and social
	support interventions, intervening mechanisms need to be better understood.
	Nevertheless, the policy implications of stress research are clear

	from existing works, such as robot indoor localization which requires

	in context-aware systems such as indoor navigation or smart self-managed
	mobile devices (e.g., battery management). Central to these systems
	is an effective method to perform location prediction under different
	constraints such as dealing with multiple wireless sources, effects
	of human body heats or mobility of the users. To this end, the second
	part of this paper presents a comparative and comprehensive study
	on different choices for modeling signals strengths and prediction
	methods under different condition settings. The results show that
	with simple, but effective modeling method, almost perfect prediction
	accuracy can be achieved in the static environment, and up to 85\%

  number = {1},
  abstract = {Background To date, our ability to accurately identify patients at
	high risk from suicidal behaviour, and thus to target interventions,
	has been fairly limited. This study examined a large pool of factors
	that are potentially associated with suicide risk from the comprehensive
	electronic medical record (EMR) and to derive a predictive model
	for 1â6 month risk. Methods 7,399 patients undergoing suicide risk
	assessment were followed up for 180 days. The dataset was divided
	into a derivation and validation cohorts of 4,911 and 2,488 respectively.
	Clinicians used an 18-point checklist of known risk factors to divide
	patients into low, medium, or high risk. Their predictive ability
	was compared with a risk stratification model derived from the EMR
	data. The model was based on the continuation-ratio ordinal regression
	method coupled with lasso (which stands for least absolute shrinkage
	and selection operator). Results In the year prior to suicide assessment,
	66.8% of patients attended the emergency department (ED) and 41.8%
	had at least one hospital admission. Administrative and demographic
	data, along with information on prior self-harm episodes, as well
	as mental and physical health diagnoses were predictive of high-risk
	suicidal behaviour. Clinicians using the 18-point checklist were
	relatively poor in predicting patients at high-risk in 3 months (AUC
	0.58, 95% CIs: 0.50 â 0.66). The model derived EMR was superior
	(AUC 0.79, 95% CIs: 0.72 â 0.84). At specificity of 0.72 (95% CIs:
	0.70-0.73) the EMR model had sensitivity of 0.70 (95% CIs: 0.56-0.83).
	Conclusion Predictive models applied to data from the EMR could improve
	risk stratification of patients presenting with potential suicidal
	behaviour. The predictive factors include known risks for suicide,
	but also other information relating to general health and health
	service utilisation. Keywords: Suicide risk; Electronic medical record;

  abstract = {The recent wide adoption of Electronic Medical Records (EMR) presents
	great opportunities and challenges for data mining. The EMR data
	is largely temporal, often noisy, irregular and high dimensional.
	This paper constructs a novel ordinal regression framework for predicting
	medical risk stratification from EMR. First, a conceptual view of
	EMR as a temporal image is constructed to extract a diverse set of
	features. Second, ordinal modeling is applied for predicting cumulative
	or progressive risk. The challenges are building a transparent predictive
	model that works with a large number of weakly predictive features,
	and at the same time, is stable against resampling variations. Our
	solution employs sparsity methods that are stabilized through domain-specific
	feature interaction networks. We introduces two indices that measure
	the model stability against data resampling. Feature networks are
	used to generate two multivariate Gaussian priors with sparse precision
	matrices (the Laplacian and Random Walk). We apply the framework
	on a large short-term suicide risk prediction problem and demonstrate
	that our methods outperform clinicians to a large-margin, discover
	suicide risk factors that conform with mental health knowledge, and

  abstract = {Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is growing at a staggering rate; but,
	little is known about the cause of this condition. Inferring learning
	patterns from therapeutic performance data, and subsequently clustering
	ASD children into subgroups, is important to understand this domain,
	and more importantly to inform evidence-based intervention. However,
	this data-driven task was difficult in the past due to the insufficiency
	of data to perform reliable analysis. For the first time, using data
	from a recent application for early intervention in autism (TOBY
	Playpad), whose download count is now exceeding 4500, we present
	in this paper the automatic discovery of learning patterns across
	32 skills in sensory, imitation and language. We use unsupervised
	learning methods for this task, but a notorious problem with existing
	methods is correct specification of number of patterns in advance,
	which in our case is even more difficulty due to complexity of the
	data. To this end, we appeal to recent Bayesian nonparametric methods,
	in particular which use Bayesian Nonparametric Factor Analysis. This
	model uses Indian Buffet Process (IBP) as prior on a binary matrix
	of infinite columns to allocate groups of intervention skills to
	children. The optimal number of learning patterns as well as subgroup
	assignments are inferred automatically from data. Our experimental
	results follow an exploratory approach, present different newly discovered
	learning patterns. To provide quantitative results, we also report
	the clustering evaluation against K-means and NMF. In addition to
	the novelty of this new problem, we were able to demonstrate the
	suitability of Bayesian nonparametric models over parametric rivals.},

  abstract = {Recent growth in broadband access and proliferation of small personal
	devices that capture images and videos has led to explosive growth
	of multimedia content available everywhere from personal disks to
	the Web. While digital media capture and upload has become nearly
	universal with newer device technology, there is still a need for
	better tools and technologies to search large collections of multimedia
	data and to find and deliver the right content to a user according
	to her current needs and preferences. A renewed focus on the subjective
	dimension in the multimedia lifecycle, from creation, distribution
	to delivery and consumption is required, to address this need beyond
	what is feasible today. Integration of the subjective aspects of
	the media itself--its affective, perceptual, and physiological potential
	(both intended and achieved), together with those of the users themselves
	will allow for personalizing the content access, beyond todays facility.
	This integration, transforming the traditional multimedia information
	retrieval (MIR) indices to more effectively answer specific user
	needs, will allow a richer degree of personalization predicated on
	user intention and mode of interaction, relationship to the producer,
	and content of the media, and their history and lifestyle. In this
	paper, we identify the challenges in achieving this integration,
	current approaches to interpreting content creation processes, to
	user modelling and profiling and to personalized content selection,
	and detail future directions. The structure of the paper is as follows:
	In section I, we introduce the problem and present some definitions.
	In section II, we present a review of the aspects of personalized
	content and current approaches for the same. Section III discusses
	the problem of obtaining metadata that is required for personalized
	media creation and present eMediate as a case study of an integrated
	media capture environment. Section IV presents MAGIC system as case
	study of in putting users first in the distributed learning delivery.
	The aspects of modelling the user are presented as a case study in
	using users personality as a way to personalize summaries in section
	V. Finally section VI concludes the paper with a discussion on the
	emerging challenges and the open problems.},

	empowering parents to help their children early. TOBY stands for

	an adaptive syllabus of more than 320 activities developed by autism
	and machine learning experts to target key development areas which
	are known to be deficit for ASD children such as imitation, joint
	attention and language. TOBY delivers lessons, materials, instructions

	increasing its complexity, varying prompts and reinforcements as
	the child progresses over time. Prompting and reinforcing strategies
	are also recommended for parents to make the most of everyday opportunities
	to teach children. Essentially, TOBY removes the burden on parents
	from extensive preparation of materials and manual data recording.
	Three trials on 20, 50 and 36 children with AutismWest (www.autismwest.org.au)
	have been conducted since last year. The results are promising providing

  abstract = {A significant portion of government health care funding is spent treating
	falls-related injuries among older adults. This cost is set to rise
	due to population aging in developed societies. Wearable sensors
	systems, often comprised of triaxial accelerometers and/or gyroscopes,
	have proven useful for real-time falls detection. However, a large
	percentage of falls occur at home and many of those happen at nighttime,
	when the person is unlikely to be wearing such an ambulatory monitoring
	device. It is envisaged that systems utilizing unobtrusive wireless
	sensors can be employed to survey the living space and identify unusual
	activity patterns which may indicate that a fall has happened at
	nighttime. In this study, a nighttime falls detection system designed
	for a single individual living at home, based on the use of passive
	infrared and pressure mat sensors, is explored. This paper describes
	both the sensor and system design, and investigates the feasibility
	of performing nighttime falls detection through the use of scripted
	scenarios using a single healthy test volunteer. In addition to normal
	movement activity, falls with unconsciousness, falls with repeated
	failed attempts to recover, and falls with successful recovery, are
	considered. By analyzing the location of sensor activity, periods
	of sensor inactivity, and unusual sensor activation patterns in uncommon
	locations, a sensitivity and specificity of 88.89% and 100%, respectively,
	are obtained (excluding falls followed by complete recovery). This
	demonstrates a proof-of-principle that nighttime falls detection
	might be achieved using a low complexity and completely unobtrusive
	wireless sensor network in the home.},
