abstract = {Traditional online algorithms encapsulate decision making under uncertainty, and give ways to hedge against all possible future events, while guaranteeing a nearly optimal solution, as compared to an offline optimum. On the other hand, machine learning algorithms are in the business of extrapolating patterns found in the data to predict the future, and usually come with strong guarantees on the expected generalization error.In this work, we develop a framework for augmenting online algorithms with a machine learned predictor to achieve competitive ratios that provably improve upon unconditional worst-case lower bounds when the predictor has low error. Our approach treats the predictor as a complete black box and is not dependent on its inner workings or the exact distribution of its errors.We apply this framework to the traditional caching problemâ€”creating an eviction strategy for a cache of size k. We demonstrate that naively following the oracleâ€™s recommendations may lead to very poor performance, even when the average error is quite low. Instead, we show how to modify the Marker algorithm to take into account the predictions and prove that this combined approach achieves a competitive ratio that both (i) decreases as the predictorâ€™s error decreases and (ii) is always capped by O(log k), which can be achieved without any assistance from the predictor. We complement our results with an empirical evaluation of our algorithm on real-world datasets and show that it performs well empirically even when using simple off-the-shelf predictions.},

abstract = {We study the problem of improving the performance of online algorithms by incorporating machine-learned predictions. The goal is to design algorithms that are both consistent and robust, meaning that the algorithm performs well when predictions are accurate and maintains worst-case guarantees. Such algorithms have been studied in a recent line of work initiated by Lykouris and Vassilvit-skii (ICML '18) and Kumar, Purohit and Svitkina (NeurIPS '18). They provide robustness-consistency trade-offs for a variety of online problems. However, they leave open the question of whether these trade-offs are tight, i.e., to what extent to such trade-offs are necessary. In this paper, we provide the first set of non-trivial lower bounds for competitive analysis using machine-learned predictions. We focus on the classic problems of ski rental and non-clairvoyant scheduling and provide optimal trade-offs in various settings.},

Then $E(\sup_{n \geqslant 1} X_n) - \sup\{EX_t: t \in T\} \leqslant (1/4)(b - a)$, and this bound is best possible. Probabilistically, this says that if a prophet (player with complete foresight) makes a side payment of $(b - a)/8$ to a gambler (player using nonanticipating stop rules), the game becomes at least fair for the gambler.},
