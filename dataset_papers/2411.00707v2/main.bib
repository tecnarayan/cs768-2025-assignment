  abstract = 	 {We initiate a general investigation into structured bandits. Specifically, for an abstract space $X$, we suppose a true reward function $f$ resides in a known, but arbitrary, function class $F$. The algorithm may then pull a number of arms $x$ (i.e., query for the value $f(x)$), and thereby attempts to identify an arm $\hat{x}$ of near-maximum reward: $f(\hat{x}) \geq \sup_x f(x) - \epsilon$. While special cases of this problem are well understood in the literature, our interest is in the possibility of a fully-general theory of bandit learnability, analogous to the PAC model for classification: that is, a theory which precisely characterizes which function classes $F$ admit a learning algorithm guaranteed to identify a near-optimal arm within a bounded number of pulls.Our main result in this regard is an illuminating impossibility result. Namely, there exist well-defined function classes $F$ such that bandit learnability is \emph{undecidable} within ZFC set theory. While such undecidability results have previously been shown for a certain abstractly-defined learning problem known as EMX, this is the first example of a natural or commonly-encountered learning problem (i.e., bandits) for which learnability can be provably undecidable. Our proof is based on establishing a (rather-sophisticated) equivalence between certain subfamilies of EMX learning problems and corresponding constructed bandit problems.Despite this general undecidability result, we also establish new general results in special cases. Specifically, we characterize the optimal query complexity in the special case of binary-valued reward functions in terms of a combinatorial complexity measure related to the teaching dimension.  We also present an extension to general bounded real-valued rewards, though in this case the upper bound is not always optimal.  We instantiate the new complexity measures for several important families of function classes $F$.}

    abstract = { Matrices of (approximate) low rank are pervasive in data science, appearing in movie preferences, text documents, survey data, medical records, and genomics. While there is a vast literature on how to exploit low rank structure in these datasets, there is less attention paid to explaining why the low rank structure appears in the first place. Here, we explain the effectiveness of low rank models in data science by considering a simple generative model for these matrices: we suppose that each row or column is associated to a (possibly high dimensional) bounded latent variable, and entries of the matrix are generated by applying a piecewise analytic function to these latent variables. These matrices are in general full rank. However, we show that we can approximate every entry of an \$m\times n\$ matrix drawn from this model to within a fixed absolute error by a low rank matrix whose rank grows as \$\mathcal{O}(\log(m+n))\$. Hence any sufficiently large matrix from such a latent variable model can be approximated, up to a small entrywise error, by a low rank matrix. }
