It is often argued that modern SAT solvers are able to exploit this hidden structure, without a precise definition of this notion. In this paper, we show that most industrial SAT instances have a high modularity that is not present in random instances. We also show that successful techniques, like learning, (indirectly) take into account this community structure. Our experimental study reveal that most learnt clauses are local on one of those modules or communities.</p>

abstract="Despite the success of modern SAT solvers on industrial instances, most of the progress relies on intensive experimental testing of improvements or new ideas. In most cases, the behavior of CDCL solvers cannot be predicted and even small changes may have a dramatic positive or negative effect. In this paper, we do not try to improve the performance of SAT solvers, but rather try to improve our understanding of their behavior. More precisely, we identify an essential structural property of industrial instances, based on the Eigenvector centrality of a graphical representation of the formula. We show how this static value, computed only once over the initial formula casts new light on the behavior of CDCL solvers.",

  abstract={We propose a simple method to extract the community structure of large networks. Our method is a heuristic method that is based on modularity optimization. It is shown to outperform all other known community detection methods in terms of computation time. Moreover, the quality of the communities detected is very good, as measured by the so-called modularity. This is shown first by identifying language communities in a Belgian mobile phone network of 2 million customers and by analysing a web graph of 118 million nodes and more than one billion links. The accuracy of our algorithm is also verified on ad hoc modular networks.}

We aim to give sufficient details about implementation to enable the reader to construct his or her own solver in a very short time. This will allow users of SAT-solvers to make domain specific extensions or adaptions of current state-of-the-art SAT-techniques, to meet the needs of a particular application area. The presented solver is designed with this in mind, and includes among other things a mechanism for adding arbitrary boolean constraints. It also supports solving a series of related SAT-problems efficiently by an incremental SAT-interface.",
