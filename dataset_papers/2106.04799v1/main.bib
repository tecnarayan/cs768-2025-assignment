We achieve this by using quantile regression to approximate the full quantile function for the state-action return distribution. By reparameterizing a distribution over the sample space, this yields an implicitly defined return distribution and gives rise to a large class of risk-sensitive policies. We demonstrate improved performance on the 57 Atari 2600 games in the ALE, and use our algorithm’s implicitly defined distributions to study the effects of risk-sensitive policies in Atari games.},

abstract = "Artificial intelligence research has seen enormous progress over the past few decades, but it predominantly relies on fixed datasets and stationary environments. Continual learning is an increasingly relevant area of study that asks how artificial systems might learn sequentially, as biological systems do, from a continuous stream of correlated data. In the present review, we relate continual learning to the learning dynamics of neural networks, highlighting the potential it has to considerably improve data efficiency. We further consider the many new biologically inspired approaches that have emerged in recent years, focusing on those that utilize regularization, modularity, memory, and meta-learning, and highlight some of the most promising and impactful directions."
