abstract="The Spiking Neural Network (SNN) has attracted more and more attention recently. It adopts binary spike signals to transmit information. Benefitting from the information passing paradigm of SNNs, the multiplications of activations and weights can be replaced by additions, which are more energy-efficient. However, its ``Hard Reset`` mechanism for the firing activity would ignore the difference among membrane potentials when the membrane potential is above the firing threshold, causing information loss. Meanwhile, quantifying the membrane potential to 0/1 spikes at the firing instants will inevitably introduce the quantization error thus bringing about information loss too. To address these problems, we propose to use the ``Soft Reset'' mechanism for the supervised training-based SNNs, which will drive the membrane potential to a dynamic reset potential according to its magnitude, and Membrane Potential Rectifier (MPR) to reduce the quantization error via redistributing the membrane potential to a range close to the spikes. Results show that the SNNs with the ``Soft Reset`` mechanism and MPR outperform their vanilla counterparts on both static and dynamic datasets.",

abstract = {The Pascal Visual Object Classes (VOC) challenge is a benchmark in visual object category recognition and detection, providing the vision and machine learning communities with a standard dataset of images and annotation, and standard evaluation procedures. Organised annually from 2005 to present, the challenge and its associated dataset has become accepted as the benchmark for object detection. 
This paper describes the dataset and evaluation procedure. We review the state-of-the-art in evaluated methods for both classification and detection, analyse whether the methods are statistically different, what they are learning from the images (e.g. the object or its context), and what the methods find easy or confuse. The paper concludes with lessons learnt in the three year history of the challenge, and proposes directions for future improvement and extension.},

ABSTRACT = {Biologically inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) are widely used to realize ultralow-power energy consumption. However, deep SNNs are not easy to train due to the excessive firing of spiking neurons in the hidden layers. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel but simple normalization technique called postsynaptic potential normalization. This normalization removes the subtraction term from the standard normalization and uses the second raw moment instead of the variance as the division term. The spike firing can be controlled, enabling the training to proceed appropriately, by conducting this simple normalization to the postsynaptic potential. The experimental results show that SNNs with our normalization outperformed other models using other normalizations. Furthermore, through the pre-activation residual blocks, the proposed model can train with more than 100 layers without other special techniques dedicated to SNNs.},
