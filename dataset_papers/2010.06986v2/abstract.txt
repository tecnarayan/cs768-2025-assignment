Search and recommendation systems, such as search engines, recruiting tools,
online marketplaces, news, and social media, output ranked lists of content,
products, and sometimes, people. Credit ratings, standardized tests, risk
assessments output only a score, but are also used implicitly for ranking. Bias
in such ranking systems, especially among the top ranks, can worsen social and
economic inequalities, polarize opinions, and reinforce stereotypes. On the
other hand, a bias correction for minority groups can cause more harm if
perceived as favoring group-fair outcomes over meritocracy. In this paper, we
formulate the problem of underranking in group-fair rankings, which was not
addressed in previous work. Most group-fair ranking algorithms post-process a
given ranking and output a group-fair ranking. We define underranking based on
how close the group-fair rank of each item is to its original rank, and prove a
lower bound on the trade-off achievable for simultaneous underranking and group
fairness in ranking. We give a fair ranking algorithm that takes any given
ranking and outputs another ranking with simultaneous underranking and group
fairness guarantees comparable to the lower bound we prove. Our algorithm works
with group fairness constraints for any number of groups. Our experimental
results confirm the theoretical trade-off between underranking and group
fairness, and also show that our algorithm achieves the best of both when
compared to the state-of-the-art baselines.
