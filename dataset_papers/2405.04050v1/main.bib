  abstract = {AFF3CT is an open source toolbox dedicated to Forward Error Correction (FEC or channel coding). It supports a broad range of codes: from widespread turbo codes and Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes to more recent polar codes. The toolbox is written in C++ and can be used either as a simulator to quickly evaluate algorithms characteristics, or as a library in Software Defined Radio (SDR) systems or for other specific needs. Most of the decoding algorithm implementations aim at low latency and high throughput, targeting multiple Gb/s on modern CPUs. This is crucial in both simulation and SDR use cases: Monte Carlo simulations require high performance implementation as they commonly target the estimation of approximately 10^{12} bits. On the other hand, the implementations in real systems have to be very efficient to be competitive against dedicated hardware ones. Finally, AFF3CT emphasizes the reproducibility of state-of-the-art results by providing public references and open, modular source code.},

	shorttitle = {{DiffWave}},
	abstract = {In this work, we propose {DiffWave}, a versatile diffusion probabilistic model for conditional and unconditional waveform generation. The model is non-autoregressive, and converts the white noise signal into structured waveform through a Markov chain with a constant number of steps at synthesis. It is efficiently trained by optimizing a variant of variational bound on the data likelihood. {DiffWave} produces high-fidelity audios in different waveform generation tasks, including neural vocoding conditioned on mel spectrogram, class-conditional generation, and unconditional generation. We demonstrate that {DiffWave} matches a strong {WaveNet} vocoder in terms of speech quality ({MOS}: 4.44 versus 4.43), while synthesizing orders of magnitude faster. In particular, it significantly outperforms autoregressive and {GAN}-based waveform models in the challenging unconditional generation task in terms of audio quality and sample diversity from various automatic and human evaluations.},

abstract = {This article examines the problem of automatte explanation of reasoning, especially as it relates to expert systems. By explanation we mean the ability of a program to discuss what it is doing in some understandable way. We first present a general framework in which to view explanation and review some of the research done in this area. We then focus on the explanation system for NEOMYCIN, a medical consultation program. A consultation program interactively helps a user to solve a problem. Our goal is to have NEOMYCIN explain its problem-solving strategies. An explanation of strategy describes the plan the program is using to reach a solution. Such an explanation is usually concrete, referring to aspects of the current problem situation. Abstract explanations articulate a general principle, which can be applied in different situations; such explanations are useful in teaching and in explaining by analogy. We describe the aspects of NEOMYCIN that make abstract strategic explanations possible—the representation of strategic knowledge explicitly and separately from domain knowledge— and demonstrate how this representation can be used to generate explanations.}

@inproceedings{Kingma2014vae,
  abstract = {How can we perform efficient inference and learning in directed probabilistic models, in the presence of continuous latent variables with intractable posterior distributions, and large datasets? We introduce a stochastic variational inference and learning algorithm that scales to large datasets and, under some mild differentiability conditions, even works in the intractable case. Our contributions is two-fold. First, we show that a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a lower bound estimator that can be straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. Second, we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent variables per datapoint, posterior inference can be made especially efficient by fitting an approximate inference model (also called a recognition model) to the intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator. Theoretical advantages are reflected in experimental results.},
