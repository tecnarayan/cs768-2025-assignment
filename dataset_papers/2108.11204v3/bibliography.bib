In the first stage we train agents to execute relatively simple actions like reaching or gripping. In the second stage we train a hierarchical manager to compose these actions to solve more complicated tasks. The manager may pass parameters to agents thus controlling details of undertaken actions. The hierarchical approach with parameters can be used with any optimization algorithm. In this work we adapt to our setting methods described in [1]. We show that their theoretical foundation, including monotonicity of improvements, still holds. We experimentally compare the hierarchical reinforcement learning with the standard, non-hierarchical approach and conclude that the hierarchical learning with parameters is a viable way to improve final results and stability of learning.} }

title={Grandmaster level in StarCraft II using multi-agent reinforcement learning},
journal={Nature},
year={2019},
month={Nov},
day={01},
volume={575},
number={7782},
pages={350-354},
abstract={Many real-world applications require artificial agents to compete and coordinate with other agents in complex environments. As a stepping stone to this goal, the domain of StarCraft has emerged as an important challenge for artificial intelligence research, owing to its iconic and enduring status among the most difficult professional esports and its relevance to the real world in terms of its raw complexity and multi-agent challenges. Over the course of a decade and numerous competitions1--3, the strongest agents have simplified important aspects of the game, utilized superhuman capabilities, or employed hand-crafted sub-systems4. Despite these advantages, no previous agent has come close to matching the overall skill of top StarCraft players. We chose to address the challenge of StarCraft using general-purpose learning methods that are in principle applicable to other complex domains: a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm that uses data from both human and agent games within a diverse league of continually adapting strategies and counter-strategies, each represented by deep neural networks5,6. We evaluated our agent, AlphaStar, in the full game of StarCraft II, through a series of online games against human players. AlphaStar was rated at Grandmaster level for all three StarCraft races and above 99.8{\%} of officially ranked human players.},

	Abstract = {The Rubik's cube is a prototypical combinatorial puzzle that has a large state space with a single goal state. The goal state is unlikely to be accessed using sequences of randomly generated moves, posing unique challenges for machine learning. We solve the Rubik's cube with DeepCubeA, a deep reinforcement learning approach that learns how to solve increasingly difficult states in reverse from the goal state without any specific domain knowledge. DeepCubeA solves 100{\%} of all test configurations, finding a shortest path to the goal state 60.3{\%} of the time. DeepCubeA generalizes to other combinatorial puzzles and is able to solve the 15 puzzle, 24 puzzle, 35 puzzle, 48 puzzle, Lights Out and Sokoban, finding a shortest path in the majority of verifiable cases.},

abstract = {Static evaluation is one of the least understood aspects of two-player games. The expected-outcome model proposes that the proper evaluation of a game-tree node is the expected value of the game's outcome given random play from that node on. Although this characterization may appear somewhat naive, experiments performed on variants of tic-tac-toe, Othello, and chess, substantiate its viability as a general paradigm of evaluator design. First, expected-outcome is considered in its ideal form, where it is shown to be a powerful heuristic. Next, the ability of a simple random sampler that estimates expected-outcome to outduel a standard Othello evaluator is demonstrated. Finally, the sampler is combined with a linear regression procedure to produce efficient expected-outcome estimators. Overall, the expected-outcome model of two-player games is shown to be precise, accurate, easily estimable, efficiently calculable, and domain-independent. {\textcopyright} 1990 IEEE},

These problems include both the difficulty of solving the game's perfect information variant, and techniques needed to address the fact that bridge is not, in fact, a perfect information game. GIB, the program being described, involves five separate technical advances: partition search, the practical application of Monte Carlo techniques to realistic problems, a focus on achievable sets to solve problems inherent in the Monte Carlo approach, an extension of alpha-beta pruning from total orders to arbitrary distributive lattices, and the use of squeaky wheel optimization to find approximately optimal solutions to cardplay problems. GIB is currently believed to be of approximately expert caliber, and is currently the strongest computer bridge program in the world. {\textcopyright}2001 AI Access Foundation and Morgan Kaufmann Publishers.

In this paper we investigate whether Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is an interesting alterna- tive for one-player games where A* and IDA* methods do not perform well. Therefore, we propose a new MCTS variant, called Single-Player Monte-Carlo Tree Search (SP-MCTS). The selection and backpropaga- tion strategy in SP-MCTS are different from standard MCTS. Moreover, SP-MCTS makes use of a straightforward Meta-Search extension. We tested the method on the puzzle SameGame. It turned out that our SP- MCTS program gained the highest score so far on the standardized test set.},
