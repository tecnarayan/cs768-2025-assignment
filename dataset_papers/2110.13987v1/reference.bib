  abstract = 	 {Recent works using deep learning to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) have focused on learning construction heuristics. Such approaches find TSP solutions of good quality but require additional procedures such as beam search and sampling to improve solutions and achieve state-of-the-art performance. However, few studies have focused on improvement heuristics, where a given solution is improved until reaching a near-optimal one. In this work, we propose to learn a local search heuristic based on 2-opt operators via deep reinforcement learning. We propose a policy gradient algorithm to learn a stochastic policy that selects 2-opt operations given a current solution. Moreover, we introduce a policy neural network that leverages a pointing attention mechanism, which unlike previous works, can be easily extended to more general $k$-opt moves. Our results show that the learned policies can improve even over random initial solutions and approach near-optimal solutions at a faster rate than previous state-of-the-art deep learning methods.}

abstract="The aim of the study is to provide interesting insights on how efficient machine learning algorithms could be adapted to solve combinatorial optimization problems in conjunction with existing heuristic procedures. More specifically, we extend the neural combinatorial optimization framework to solve the traveling salesman problem (TSP). In this framework, the city coordinates are used as inputs and the neural network is trained using reinforcement learning to predict a distribution over city permutations. Our proposed framework differs from the one in [1] since we do not make use of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture and we opted to design our own critic to compute a baseline for the tour length which results in more efficient learning. More importantly, we further enhance the solution approach with the well-known 2-opt heuristic. The results show that the performance of the proposed framework alone is generally as good as high performance heuristics (OR-Tools). When the framework is equipped with a simple 2-opt procedure, it could outperform such heuristics and achieve close to optimal results on 2D Euclidean graphs. This demonstrates that our approach based on machine learning techniques could learn good heuristics which, once being enhanced with a simple local search, yield promising results.",

  abstract = 	 {The past few years have witnessed a growth in size and computational requirements for training and inference with neural networks. Currently, a common approach to address these requirements is to use a heterogeneous distributed environment with a mixture of hardware devices such as CPUs and GPUs. Importantly, the decision of placing parts of the neural models on devices is often made by human experts based on simple heuristics and intuitions. In this paper, we propose a method which learns to optimize device placement for TensorFlow computational graphs. Key to our method is the use of a sequence-to-sequence model to predict which subsets of operations in a TensorFlow graph should run on which of the available devices. The execution time of the predicted placements is then used as the reward signal to optimize the parameters of the sequence-to-sequence model. Our main result is that on Inception-V3 for ImageNet classification, and on RNN LSTM, for language modeling and neural machine translation, our model finds non-trivial device placements that outperform hand-crafted heuristics and traditional algo-rithmic methods.}

abstract = {Abstract The following is a valid model for an important class of scheduling and routing problems. A salesman who travels between pairs of cities at a cost depending only on the pair, gets a prize in every city that he vitis and pays a penalty to every city that he fails to visit, wishes to minimize his travel costs and net penalties, while visiting enough cities to collect a prescribed amount of prize money. We call this problem the Prize Collecting Traveling Salesman Problem (PCTSP). This paper discusses structural properties of the PCTS polytope, the convex hull of solutions to the PCTSP. In particular, it identifies several families of facet defining inequalities for this polytope. Some of these inequalities are related to facets of the ordinary TS polytope, others to facets of the knapsack polytope. They can be used in algorithms for the PCTSP either as cutting planes or as ingredients of a Lagrangean optimand.},

  abstract = 	 {Model-free deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have been demonstrated on a range of challenging decision making and control tasks. However, these methods typically suffer from two major challenges: very high sample complexity and brittle convergence properties, which necessitate meticulous hyperparameter tuning. Both of these challenges severely limit the applicability of such methods to complex, real-world domains. In this paper, we propose soft actor-critic, an off-policy actor-critic deep RL algorithm based on the maximum entropy reinforcement learning framework. In this framework, the actor aims to maximize expected reward while also maximizing entropy. That is, to succeed at the task while acting as randomly as possible. Prior deep RL methods based on this framework have been formulated as Q-learning methods. By combining off-policy updates with a stable stochastic actor-critic formulation, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on a range of continuous control benchmark tasks, outperforming prior on-policy and off-policy methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, in contrast to other off-policy algorithms, our approach is very stable, achieving very similar performance across different random seeds.}

  abstract = 	 {Designing efficient algorithms for combinatorial optimization appears ubiquitously in various scientific fields. Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) frameworks have gained considerable attention as a new approach: they can automate the design of a solver while relying less on sophisticated domain knowledge of the target problem. However, the existing DRL solvers determine the solution using a number of stages proportional to the number of elements in the solution, which severely limits their applicability to large-scale graphs. In this paper, we seek to resolve this issue by proposing a novel DRL scheme, coined learning what to defer (LwD), where the agent adaptively shrinks or stretch the number of stages by learning to distribute the element-wise decisions of the solution at each stage. We apply the proposed framework to the maximum independent set (MIS) problem, and demonstrate its significant improvement over the current state-of-the-art DRL scheme. We also show that LwD can outperform the conventional MIS solvers on large-scale graphs having millions of vertices, under a limited time budget.}
