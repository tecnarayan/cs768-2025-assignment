A well-known result of Lai and Robbins, which has then been extended by Burnetas and Katehakis, has established the presence of a logarithmic bound for all consistent policies. We relax the notion of consistence, and exhibit a generalisation of the logarithmic bound. We also show the non existence of logarithmic bound in the general case of Hannan consistency. To get these results, we study variants of popular Upper Confidence Bounds (ucb) policies. As a by-product, we prove that it is impossible to design an adaptive policy that would select the best of two algorithms by taking advantage of the properties of the environment.}},

We give matching impossibility results showing that the KWIK learnability requirement cannot be replaced by weaker supervised learning assumptions. We provide such results in both the standard parametric MAB setting, as well as for a new model in which the action space is finite but growing with time.},
