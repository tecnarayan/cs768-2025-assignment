abstract = 	 {As its width tends to infinity, a deep neural networkâ€™s behavior under gradient descent can become simplified and predictable (e.g. given by the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)), if it is parametrized appropriately (e.g. the NTK parametrization). However, we show that the standard and NTK parametrizations of a neural network do not admit infinite-width limits that can *learn* features, which is crucial for pretraining and transfer learning such as with BERT. We propose simple modifications to the standard parametrization to allow for feature learning in the limit. Using the *Tensor Programs* technique, we derive explicit formulas for such limits. On Word2Vec and few-shot learning on Omniglot via MAML, two canonical tasks that rely crucially on feature learning, we compute these limits exactly. We find that they outperform both NTK baselines and finite-width networks, with the latter approaching the infinite-width feature learning performance as width increases.}

abstract = 	 {Yang (2020) recently showed that the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) at initialization has an infinite-width limit for a large class of architectures including modern staples such as ResNet and Transformers. However, their analysis does not apply to training. Here, we show the same neural networks (in the so-called NTK parametrization) during training follow a kernel gradient descent dynamics in function space, where the kernel is the infinite-width NTK. This completes the proof of the architectural universality of NTK behavior. To achieve this result, we apply the Tensor Programs technique: Write the entire SGD dynamics inside a Tensor Program and analyze it via the Master Theorem. To facilitate this proof, we develop a graphical notation for Tensor Programs, which we believe is also an important contribution toward the pedagogy and exposition of the Tensor Programs technique.}

abstract = 	 {We consider fully connected feed-forward deep neural networks (NNs) where weights and biases are independent and identically distributed as symmetric centered stable distributions. Then, we show that the infinite wide limit of the NN, under suitable scaling on the weights, is a stochastic process whose finite-dimensional distributions are multivariate stable distributions. The limiting process is referred to as the stable process, and it generalizes the class of Gaussian processes recently obtained as infinite wide limits of NNs (Matthews at al., 2018b). Parameters of the stable process can be computed via an explicit recursion over the layers of the network. Our result contributes to the theory of fully connected feed-forward deep NNs, and it paves the way to expand recent lines of research that rely on Gaussian infinite wide limits.}

abstract="Forest fire is a disaster that causes economic and ecological damage and human life threat. Thus predicting such critical environmental issue is essential to mitigate this threat. In this paper we propose a decision tree based system for forest fire prediction. The aim being the integration of the decision tree classifier as a part of the smart sensor node architecture that allows fire prediction in automated and intelligent way without requiring human intervention. The fire prediction is based on the meteorological data corresponding to the critical weather elements that influence the forest fire occurrence, namely temperature, relative humidity and wind speed. We have obtained accuracy about 82.92{\%} regarding the software implementation of the proposed DT based forest fire prediction system.",

  abstract = 	 {Gradient descent finds a global minimum in training deep neural networks despite the objective function being non-convex. The current paper proves gradient descent achieves zero training loss in polynomial time for a deep over-parameterized neural network with residual connections (ResNet). Our analysis relies on the particular structure of the Gram matrix induced by the neural network architecture. This structure allows us to show the Gram matrix is stable throughout the training process and this stability implies the global optimality of the gradient descent algorithm. We further extend our analysis to deep residual convolutional neural networks and obtain a similar convergence result.}

  abstract = 	 {A recent line of work has analyzed the theoretical properties of deep neural networks via the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK). In particular, the smallest eigenvalue of the NTK has been related to the memorization capacity, the global convergence of gradient descent algorithms and the generalization of deep nets. However, existing results either provide bounds in the two-layer setting or assume that the spectrum of the NTK matrices is bounded away from 0 for multi-layer networks. In this paper, we provide tight bounds on the smallest eigenvalue of NTK matrices for deep ReLU nets, both in the limiting case of infinite widths and for finite widths. In the finite-width setting, the network architectures we consider are fairly general: we require the existence of a wide layer with roughly order of $N$ neurons, $N$ being the number of data samples; and the scaling of the remaining layer widths is arbitrary (up to logarithmic factors). To obtain our results, we analyze various quantities of independent interest: we give lower bounds on the smallest singular value of hidden feature matrices, and upper bounds on the Lipschitz constant of input-output feature maps.}
