@article{Bracken74b,
	Abstract = {Bracken and McGill have discussed the theory, computations, and an example of mathematical programming models with optimization problems in the constraints [Opns. Res. 21, 37-44 (1973)], and have presented a computer program for solving such models with nonlinear programs in the constraints [Opns. Res 22, 1097-1101 (1974)]. Bracken, Falk, and McGill have given a procedure for transforming mathematical programs with two-sided optimization problems in the constraints into mathematical programs with nonlinear programs in the constrains [Opns. Res. 22, 1102-1104 (1974)], thus enabling their solution by the computer program. This paper formulates models of defense problems that are convex programs having the mathematical properties treated in the previous papers. The models include several strategic-force-planning models and two general-purpose-force planning models.},

@article{Bomze1997,
	Abstract = {As is well known, the problem of finding a maximum clique in a graph isNP-hard. Nevertheless, NP-hard problems may have easy instances. This paperproposes a new, global optimization algorithm which tries to exploit favourabledata constellations, focussing on the continuous problem formulation: maximizea quadratic form over the standard simplex. Some general connections of thelatter problem with dynamic principles of evolutionary game theory areestablished. As an immediate consequence, one obtains a procedure whichconsists (a) of an iterative part similar to interior-path methods based on theso-called replicator dynamics; and (b) a routine to escape from inefficient,locally optimal solutions. For the special case of finding a maximum clique ina graph where the quadratic form arises from a regularization of the adjacencematrix, part (b), i.e. escaping from maximal cliques not of maximal size, isaccomplished with block pivoting methods based on (large) independent sets,i.e. cliques of the complementary graph. A simulation study is included whichindicates that the resulting procedure indeed has some merits.},

	Abstract = {We prove lower bounds on the complexity of finding {\$}{\$}{\backslash}epsilon {\$}{\$}ϵ-stationary points (points x such that {\$}{\$}{\backslash}Vert {\backslash}nabla f(x){\backslash}Vert {\backslash}le {\backslash}epsilon {\$}{\$}{\textbardbl}∇f(x){\textbardbl}≤ϵ) of smooth, high-dimensional, and potentially non-convex functions f. We consider oracle-based complexity measures, where an algorithm is given access to the value and all derivatives of f at a query point x. We show that for any (potentially randomized) algorithm {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathsf {\{}A{\}}{\$}{\$}A, there exists a function f with Lipschitz pth order derivatives such that {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathsf {\{}A{\}}{\$}{\$}Arequires at least {\$}{\$}{\backslash}epsilon ^{\{}-(p+1)/p{\}}{\$}{\$}ϵ-(p+1)/pqueries to find an {\$}{\$}{\backslash}epsilon {\$}{\$}ϵ-stationary point. Our lower bounds are sharp to within constants, and they show that gradient descent, cubic-regularized Newton's method, and generalized pth order regularization are worst-case optimal within their natural function classes.},

	Abstract = {We propose a general feasible method for nonsmooth, nonconvex constrained optimization problems. The algorithm is based on the (inexact) solution of a sequence of strongly convex optimization subproblems, followed by a step-size procedure. Key features of the scheme are: (i) it preserves feasibility of the iterates for nonconvex problems with nonconvex constraints, (ii) it can handle nonsmooth problems, and (iii) it naturally leads to parallel/distributed implementations. We illustrate the application of the method to an open problem in green communications whereby the energy consumption in MIMO multiuser interference networks is minimized, subject to nonconvex Quality-of-Service constraints.},

For this scheme, we prove general local convergence results. However, the main contribution of the paper is related to global worst-case complexity bounds for different problem classes including some nonconvex cases. It is shown that the search direction can be computed by standard linear algebra technique.},

It is based on a special smoothing technique, which can be applied to functions with explicit max-structure. Our approach can be considered as an alternative to black-box minimization. From the viewpoint of efficiency estimates, we manage to improve the traditional bounds on the number of iterations of the gradient schemes from                                    keeping basically the complexity of each iteration unchanged.},

	Abstract = {Quadratic optimization comprises one of the most important areas of nonlinear programming. Numerous problems in real world applications, including problems in planning and scheduling, economies of scale, and engineering design, and control are naturally expressed as quadratic problems. Moreover, the quadratic problem is known to be NP-hard, which makes this one of the most interesting and challenging class of optimization problems. In this chapter, we review various properties of the quadratic problem, and discuss different techniques for solving various classes of quadratic problems. Some of the more successful algorithms for solving the special cases of bound constrained and large scale quadratic problems are considered. Examples of various applications of quadratic programming are presented. A summary of the available computational results for the algorithms to solve the various classes of problems is presented.},
