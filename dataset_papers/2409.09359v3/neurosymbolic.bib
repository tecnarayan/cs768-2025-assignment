abstract = {Most system level software is written in C and executed concurrently. Because such software is often critical for system reliability, it is an ideal target for formal verification.
Annotated C and the Verified C Compiler (VCC) form the first modular sound verification methodology for concurrent C that scales to real-world production code. VCC
is integrated in Microsoft Visual Studio and it comes with support for verification debugging: an explorer for counterexamples of failed proofs helps to find errors in code or specifications, and a prover log analyzer helps debugging proof attempts that exhaust available resources (memory, time). VCC is currently used to verify the core of Microsoft
Hyper-V, consisting of 50,000 lines of system-level C code.

To scale to large data sets and high-dimensional models, Pyro uses stochastic variational inference algorithms and probability distributions built on top of PyTorch, a modern GPU-accelerated deep learning framework. To accommodate complex or model-specific algorithmic behavior, Pyro leverages Poutine, a library of composable building blocks for modifying the behavior of probabilistic programs.},

   abstract = {An efficient piecewise linear approximation of a nonlinear function (PLAN) is proposed. This uses a simple digital gate design to perform a direct transformation from X to Y, where X is the input and Y is the approximated sigmoidal output. This PLAN is then used within the outputs of an artificial neural network to perform the nonlinear approximation. The comparison of this technique with two other sigmoidal approximation techniques for digital circuits is presented and the results show that the fast and compact digital circuit proposed produces the closest approximation to the sigmoid function. The hardware implementation of PLAN has been verified by a VHDL simulation with Mentor Graphics running under the UNIX operating system.},

In this paper, we present a strategy for learning a set of neural network modules that can be combined in different ways. We train different modular structures on a set of related tasks and generalize to new tasks by composing the learned modules in new ways. By reusing modules to generalize we achieve combinatorial generalization, akin to the ”infinite use of finite means” displayed in language. Finally, we show this improves performance in two robotics-related problems.} }

abstract = {Programming by example (PBE) is an important subproblem of program synthesis, and PBE techniques have been applied to many domains. Though many techniques for accelerating PBE systems have been explored, the scalability remains one of the main challenges: There is still a gap between the performances of state-of-the-art synthesizers and the industrial requirement. To further speed up solving PBE tasks, in this paper, we propose a novel PBE framework MaxFlash. MaxFlash uses a model based on structural probability, named topdown prediction models, to guide a search based on dynamic programming, such that the search will focus on subproblems that form probable programs, and avoid improbable programs. Our evaluation shows that MaxFlash achieves \texttimes{} 4.107− \texttimes{} 2080 speed-ups against state-of-the-art solvers on 244 real-world tasks.},

To ground these abstract representations of entities to actual objects in the world, we formulate an interactive inference algorithm which incorporates dynamic information in the scene. Our model can handle a variable number of entities by symmetrically processing each object representation with the same locally-scoped function. On block-stacking tasks, OP3 can generalize to novel block configurations and more objects than seen during training, outperforming both a model that assumes access to object supervision and a state-of-the-art video prediction model.}

  abstract = 	 {Humans can understand and produce new utterances effortlessly, thanks to their compositional skills. Once a person learns the meaning of a new verb "dax," he or she can immediately understand the meaning of "dax twice" or "sing and dax." In this paper, we introduce the SCAN domain, consisting of a set of simple compositional navigation commands paired with the corresponding action sequences. We then test the zero-shot generalization capabilities of a variety of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained on SCAN with sequence-to-sequence methods. We find that RNNs can make successful zero-shot generalizations when the differences between training and test commands are small, so that they can apply "mix-and-match" strategies to solve the task. However, when generalization requires systematic compositional skills (as in the "dax" example above), RNNs fail spectacularly. We conclude with a proof-of-concept experiment in neural machine translation, suggesting that lack of systematicity might be partially responsible for neural networks’ notorious training data thirst.}
