  abstract = {
    The concept of creating autonomous agents capable of exhibiting
    ad hoc teamwork was recently introduced as a challenge to the
    AI, and specifically to the multiagent systems community.  An agent capable
    of ad hoc teamwork is one that can effectively cooperate with multiple
    potential teammates on a set of collaborative
    tasks.  Previous research has investigated theoretically optimal ad
    hoc teamwork strategies in restrictive settings.  This paper
    presents the first empirical study of ad hoc teamwork in a more
    open, complex teamwork domain.  Specifically, we evaluate a range of
    effective algorithms for on-line behavior generation on the part of a
    single ad hoc team agent that must collaborate with a range of possible
    teammates in the pursuit domain.

  abstract={
    Many scenarios require that robots work together as a team in order to
    effectively accomplish their tasks.  However, pre-coordinating these teams
    may not always be possible given the growing number of companies and research
    labs creating these robots.  Therefore, it is desirable for robots to be able
    to reason about ad hoc teamwork and adapt to new teammates on the fly.  Past
    research on ad hoc teamwork has focused on relatively simple domains, but
    this paper demonstrates that agents can reason about ad hoc teamwork in
    complex scenarios.  To handle these complex scenarios, we introduce a new
    algorithm, PLASTIC-Policy, that builds on an existing ad hoc teamwork
    approach.  Specifically, PLASTIC-Policy learns policies to cooperate with
    past teammates and reuses these policies to quickly adapt to new teammates.
    This approach is tested in the 2D simulation soccer league of RoboCup using
    the half field offense task.
