	abstract = {We introduce a broad learning model formed by cascades of predictors, Deep Cascades, that is structured as general decision trees in which leaf predictors or node questions may be members of rich function families. We present new data-dependent theoretical guarantees for learning with Deep Cascades with complex leaf predictors and node questions in terms of the Rademacher complexities of the sub-families composing these sets of predictors and the fraction of sample points reaching each leaf that are correctly classified. These guarantees can guide the design of a variety of different algorithms for deep cascade models and we give a detailed description of two such algorithms. Our second algorithm uses as node and leaf classifiers {SVM} predictors and we report the results of experiments comparing its performance with that of {SVM} combined with polynomial kernels.},

	abstract = {In the Neyman-Pearson ({NP}) classification paradigm, the goal is to learn a classifier from labeled training data such that the probability of a false negative is minimized while the probability of a false positive is below a user-specified level alpha isin (0,1). This work addresses the question of how to evaluate and compare classifiers in the {NP} setting. Simply reporting false positives and false negatives leaves some ambiguity about which classifier is best. Unlike conventional classification, however, there is no natural performance measure for {NP} classification. We cannot reject classifiers whose false positive rate exceeds a since, among other reasons, the false positive rate must be estimated from data and hence is not known with certainty. We propose two families of performance measures for evaluating and comparing classifiers and suggest one criterion in particular for practical use. We then present general learning rules that satisfy performance guarantees with respect to these criteria. As in conventional classification, the notion of uniform convergence plays a central role, and leads to finite sample bounds, oracle inequalities, consistency, and rates of convergence. The proposed performance measures are also applicable to the problem of anomaly prediction.},

We present a full theoretical analysis of this framework including new data-dependent learning bounds in terms of the Rademacher complexities of the classiﬁer and rejection families as well as consistency and calibration results. These theoretical guarantees guide us in designing new algorithms that can exploit diﬀerent kernel-based hypothesis sets for the classiﬁer and rejection functions. We compare and contrast our general framework with the special case of conﬁdence-based rejection for which we devise alternative loss functions and algorithms as well. We report the results of several experiments showing that our kernel-based algorithms can yield a notable improvement over the best existing conﬁdence-based rejection algorithm.},

	abstract = {The Neyman-Pearson ({NP}) approach to hypothesis testing is useful in situations where different types of error have different consequences or a priori probabilities are unknown. For any /spl alpha/{\textgreater}0, the {NP} lemma specifies the most powerful test of size /spl alpha/, but assumes the distributions for each hypothesis are known or (in some cases) the likelihood ratio is monotonic in an unknown parameter. This paper investigates an extension of {NP} theory to situations in which one has no knowledge of the underlying distributions except for a collection of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) training examples from each hypothesis. Building on a "fundamental lemma" of Cannon et al., we demonstrate that several concepts from statistical learning theory have counterparts in the {NP} context. Specifically, we consider constrained versions of empirical risk minimization ({NP}-{ERM}) and structural risk minimization ({NP}-{SRM}), and prove performance guarantees for both. General conditions are given under which {NP}-{SRM} leads to strong universal consistency. We also apply {NP}-{SRM} to (dyadic) decision trees to derive rates of convergence. Finally, we present explicit algorithms to implement {NP}-{SRM} for histograms and dyadic decision trees.},

  abstract = 	 {We explore and expand the Soft Nearest Neighbor Loss to measure the entanglement of class manifolds in representation space: i.e., how close pairs of points from the same class are relative to pairs of points from different classes. We demonstrate several use cases of the loss. As an analytical tool, it provides insights into the evolution of class similarity structures during learning. Surprisingly, we find that maximizing the entanglement of representations of different classes in the hidden layers is beneficial for discrimination in the final layer, possibly because it encourages representations to identify class-independent similarity structures. Maximizing the soft nearest neighbor loss in the hidden layers leads not only to better-calibrated estimates of uncertainty on outlier data but also marginally improved generalization. Data that is not from the training distribution can be recognized by observing that in the hidden layers, it has fewer than the normal number of neighbors from the predicted class.}
