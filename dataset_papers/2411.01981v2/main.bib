	abstract = {Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection has recently received special attention due to its critical role in safely deploying modern deep learning (DL) architectures. This work proposes a reconstruction-based multi-class OOD detector that operates on radar range doppler images (RDIs). The detector aims to classify any moving object other than a person sitting, standing, or walking as OOD. We also provide a simple yet effective pre-processing technique to detect minor human body movements like breathing. The simple idea is called respiration detector (RESPD) and eases the OOD detection, especially for human sitting and standing classes. On our dataset collected by 60GHz short-range FMCW Radar, we achieve AUROCs of 97.45\%, 92.13\%, and 96.58\% for sitting, standing, and walking classes, respectively. We perform extensive experiments and show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) OOD detection methods. Also, our pipeline performs 24 times faster than the second-best method and is very suitable for real-time processing.},

	abstract = {The goal of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is to handle the situations where the test samples are drawn from a different distribution than the training data. In this paper, we argue that OOD samples can be detected more easily if the training data is embedded into a low-dimensional space, such that the embedded training samples lie on a union of 1-dimensional subspaces. We show that such embedding of the in-distribution (ID) samples provides us with two main advantages. First, due to compact representation in the feature space, OOD samples are less likely to occupy the same region as the known classes. Second, the ﬁrst singular vector of ID samples belonging to a 1-dimensional subspace can be used as their robust representative. Motivated by these observations, we train a deep neural network such that the ID samples are embedded onto a union of 1-dimensional subspaces. At the test time, employing sampling techniques used for approximate Bayesian inference in deep learning, input samples are detected as OOD if they occupy the region corresponding to the ID samples with probability 0. Spectral components of the ID samples are used as robust representative of this region. Our method does not have any hyperparameter to be tuned using extra information and it can be applied on different modalities with minimal change. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated on different benchmark datasets, both in the image and video classiﬁcation domains.},

	title = {Mitigating {Neural} {Network} {Overconfidence} with {Logit} {Normalization}},
	abstract = {Detecting out-of-distribution inputs is critical for the safe deployment of machine learning models in the real world. However, neural networks are known to suffer from the overconfidence issue, where they produce abnormally high confidence for both in- and out-of-distribution inputs. In this work, we show that this issue can be mitigated through Logit Normalization (LogitNorm)—a simple fix to the cross-entropy loss—by enforcing a constant vector norm on the logits in training. Our method is motivated by the analysis that the norm of the logit keeps increasing during training, leading to overconfident output. Our key idea behind LogitNorm is thus to decouple the influence of output’s norm during network optimization. Trained with LogitNorm, neural networks produce highly distinguishable confidence scores between in- and out-of-distribution data. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of LogitNorm, reducing the average FPR95 by up to 42.30\% on common benchmarks.},

	abstract = {Deep learning tools have gained tremendous attention in applied machine learning. However such tools for regression and classification do not capture model uncertainty. In comparison, Bayesian models offer a mathematically grounded framework to reason about model uncertainty, but usually come with a prohibitive computational cost. In this paper we develop a new theoretical framework casting dropout training in deep neural networks (NNs) as approximate Bayesian inference in deep Gaussian processes. A direct result of this theory gives us tools to model uncertainty with dropout NNs -- extracting information from existing models that has been thrown away so far. This mitigates the problem of representing uncertainty in deep learning without sacrificing either computational complexity or test accuracy. We perform an extensive study of the properties of dropout's uncertainty. Various network architectures and non-linearities are assessed on tasks of regression and classification, using MNIST as an example. We show a considerable improvement in predictive log-likelihood and RMSE compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, and finish by using dropout's uncertainty in deep reinforcement learning.},

	abstract = {SAM, In today’s heavily overparameterized models, the value of the training loss provides few guarantees on model generalization ability. Indeed, optimizing only the training loss value, as is commonly done, can easily lead to suboptimal model quality. Motivated by prior work connecting the geometry of the loss landscape and generalization, we introduce a novel, effective procedure for instead simultaneously minimizing loss value and loss sharpness. In particular, our procedure, Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), seeks parameters that lie in neighborhoods having uniformly low loss; this formulation results in a minmax optimization problem on which gradient descent can be performed efﬁciently. We present empirical results showing that SAM improves model generalization across a variety of benchmark datasets (e.g., CIFAR-\{10, 100\}, ImageNet, ﬁnetuning tasks) and models, yielding novel state-of-the-art performance for several. Additionally, we ﬁnd that SAM natively provides robustness to label noise on par with that provided by state-of-the-art procedures that speciﬁcally target learning with noisy labels.
