  abstract = {This study proposes distributed energy management approach for charging multi-class electric vehicles (EVs) in community microgrids. The energy management problem is implemented in real-time and represented by a non-cooperative Stackelberg game for the power distribution inside the microgrid. In this game, a battery energy storage system is chosen as a leader and the EVs are designated as followers. The charging power distribution among EVs is tackled in the two cases of `plenty of power' and `lack of power'. The challenging case of `lack of power' occurs when the total charging power is insufficient to meet the need of each EV, such as when weather conditions are unfavourable. A priority factor is included in the EV utility functions to address charging priorities of different classes of EVs in practical scenarios. A consensus-based distributed algorithm is developed later to iteratively reach the Nash equilibrium, i.e. final charging power distribution, among EVs with different charging priorities. Both simulation and experimental results show that the charging power is properly distributed when the predefined charging priorities are followed, particularly in the case of a `lack of power'.},

Our analysis contains two key insights. We use careful application of concentration inequalities to the optimal value function as a whole, rather than to the transitions probabilities (to improve scaling in \$S\$), and we define Bernstein-based "exploration bonuses" that use the empirical variance of the estimated values at the next states (to improve scaling in \$H\$).},

It is shown that various anomalies may occur, especially for stationary (randomized) policies; uniformization introduces virtual jumps with concomitant action changes not present in the original process. Since these lead to discrepancies in the average rewards for stationary processes, uniformization can be accepted as valid only for simple policies. We generalize uniformization to yield consistent results for stationary policies also. These results are applied to constrained optimization of SMDP, in which stationary (randomized) policies appear naturally. The structure of optimal constrained SMDP policies can then be elucidated by studying the corresponding controlled Markov chains. Moreover, constrained SMDP optimal policy computations can be more easily implemented in discrete time, the generalized uniformization being employed to relate discrete- and continuous-time optimal constrained policies.},

As a joint result of the current state s and the chosen action a, two things happen: (1) we receive an immediate income i(s, a) and (2) the system moves to a new state s' with the probability of a particular new state s' given by a function q = q(s' {$\mid$} s, a). Finally there is specified a discount factor \${\textbackslash}beta, 0 {\textbackslash}leqq {\textbackslash}beta {$<$} 1\$, so that the value of unit income n days in the future is {$\beta$}n. Our problem is to choose a policy which maximizes our total expected income. This problem, which is an interesting special case of the general dynamic programming problem, has been solved by Howard in his excellent book [3]. The case {$\beta$} = 1, also studied by Howard, is substantially more difficult. We shall obtain in this case results slightly beyond those of Howard, though still not complete. Our method, which treats {$\beta$} = 1 as a limiting case of \${\textbackslash}beta {$<$} 1\$, seems rather simpler than Howard's.},

Despite its nice and generic theoretical regret guarantees, this algorithm and its variants have remained until now mostly theoretical as numerical experiments in simple environments exhibit long burn-in phases before the learning takes place. In pursuit of practical efficiency, we present UCRL3, following the lines of UCRL2, but with two key modifications: First, it uses state-of-the-art time-uniform concentration inequalities to compute confidence sets on the reward and (component-wise) transition distributions for each state-action pair. Furthermore, to tighten exploration, it uses an adaptive computation of the support of each transition distribution, which in turn enables us to revisit the extended value iteration procedure of UCRL2 to optimize over distributions with reduced support by disregarding low probability transitions, while still ensuring near-optimism. We demonstrate, through numerical experiments in standard environments, that reducing exploration this way yields a substantial numerical improvement compared to UCRL2 and its variants. On the theoretical side, these key modifications enable us to derive a regret bound for UCRL3 improving on UCRL2, that for the first time makes appear notions of local diameter and local effective support, thanks to variance-aware concentration bounds.},

Surprisingly, moments of order 2 (i.e., finite variance) are sufficient to obtain regret bounds of the same order as under sub-Gaussian reward distributions.

  abstract = {Architectures for Internet quality of service (QoS) have been under discussion for over a decade and, with the commercialization of the Internet, the topic has become increasingly important. This paper gives a background and history of QoS for the Internet, then introduces and motivates the differentiated services (Diffserv) approach. The major advantages of the Diffserv approach are that it is a good match to the Internet architecture and that it can be initially deployed with a minimalist approach, adding complexity as needed. Despite the long history of discussion, the phrase "quality of service" does not have a universally accepted meaning. In this paper QoS is used to describe a set of measurable parameters, such as delay, throughput, and loss rate, that can be attached to some identifiable subset of the traffic of IP packets through a given network domain. The identifiable subset of traffic belongs to a "user" of IP QoS where "user" spans a range of granularities, from a single application program to an entire company. Providing guarantees about the values of network parameters requires the implementation and deployment of physical mechanisms throughout the network and then configuring these mechanisms in such a way that their effect, when viewed from the edges of the network, composes into the desired QoS. Diffserv uses simple mechanisms in a more complex composition, allowing the details of the composition to evolve while the mechanisms, part of the network infrastructure, can remain the same. The paper discusses the specifics of this approach and why it is well-matched to the Internet. Some practical issues for deployment are addressed. Further we address resource allocation and configuration questions, including simple possibilities for early deployment and some of the open questions for a more complex future deployment. This paper takes the position that it is possible to maintain reasonable QoS levels without recourse to any of the class of constrained routing approaches (including MPLS), though Diffserv can be used with these approaches if desired.},

With a fixed reward collected upon service completion and a cost per unit of time enforced on customers waiting in the queue, a dispatcher decides upon arrivals whether to admit the arriving customer or not based on the full history of observations of the queue length of the system. Naor [Naor P (1969) The regulation of queue size by levying tolls. Econometrica 37(1):15--24] shows that, if all the parameters of the model are known, then it is optimal to use a static threshold policy: admit if the queue length is less than a predetermined threshold and otherwise not. We propose a learning-based dispatching algorithm and characterize its regret with respect to optimal dispatch policies for the full-information model of Naor [Naor P (1969) The regulation of queue size by levying tolls. Econometrica 37(1):15--24]. We show that the algorithm achieves an O(1) regret when all optimal thresholds with full information are nonzero and achieves an  {$O$}( ln 1+{$\in$} ({$N$})) O(ln1+{$\epsilon$}(N))  regret for any specified  {$\in>$}0 {$\epsilon>$}0  in the case that an optimal threshold with full information is 0 (i.e., an optimal policy is to reject all arrivals), where N is the number of arrivals.

We prove that the convergence of Value Iteration generally implies that of Rolling Horizon.

Thus, full-planning in model-based RL can be avoided altogether without any performance degradation, and, by doing so, the computational complexity decreases by a factor of \$S\$. The results are based on a novel analysis of real-time dynamic programming, then extended to model-based RL. Specifically, we generalize existing algorithms that perform full-planning to such that act by 1-step planning. For these generalizations, we prove regret bounds with the same rate as their full-planning counterparts.},

In MDPs, optimism can be implemented by carrying out extended value iterations under a constraint of consistency with the estimated model transition probabilities. The UCRL2 algorithm by Auer, Jaksch and Ortner (2009), which follows this strategy, has recently been shown to guarantee near-optimal regret bounds. In this paper, we strongly argue in favor of using the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence for this purpose. By studying the linear maximization problem under KL constraints, we provide an efficient algorithm, termed KL-UCRL, for solving KL-optimistic extended value iteration. Using recent deviation bounds on the KL divergence, we prove that KL-UCRL provides the same guarantees as UCRL2 in terms of regret. However, numerical experiments on classical benchmarks show a significantly improved behavior, particularly when the MDP has reduced connectivity. To support this observation, we provide elements of comparison between the two algorithms based on geometric considerations.},

Nonetheless, the PAC-SMDP sample complexity of RMAX-SMDP can hardly be translated into equivalent PAC-MDP theoretical guarantees, while UCRL-SMDP requires prior knowledge of the parameters characterizing the distributions of the cumulative reward and duration of each option, which are hardly available in practice. In this paper, we remove this limitation by combining the SMDP view together with the inner Markov structure of options into a novel algorithm whose regret performance matches UCRL-SMDP's up to an additive regret term. We show scenarios where this term is negligible and the advantage of temporal abstraction is preserved. We also report preliminary empirical result supporting the theoretical findings.},

In contrast to discrete-time MDPs, a continuous-time process moves to a state and stays there for a random holding time after an action is taken. With unknown transition probabilities and rates of exponential holding times, we derive instance-dependent regret lower bounds that are logarithmic in the time horizon. Moreover, we design a learning algorithm and establish a finite-time regret bound that achieves the logarithmic growth rate. Our analysis builds upon upper confidence reinforcement learning, a delicate estimation of the mean holding times, and stochastic comparison of point processes.},

It shows that the only gain (average) optimal stationary policies with gain and bias which satisfy the optimality equation are of control limit type, that there are at most two and, if there are two, they occur consecutively. Conditions are provided which ensure the existence of two gain optimal control limit policies and are illustrated with an example. The main result is that bias optimality distinguishes these two gain optimal policies and that the larger of the two control limits is the unique bias optimal stationary policy. Consequently it is also Blackwell optimal. This result is established by appealing to the third optimality equation of the Markov decision process and some observations concerning the structure of solutions of the second optimality equation.}

We use the dual linear programming  formulation of the MDP average cost problem, in which the variable is  a stationary distribution over state-action pairs, and we consider a  neighborhood of a low-dimensional subset of the set of stationary  distributions (defined in terms of state-action features) as  the comparison class.

In both cases, we give bounds  that show that the performance of our algorithms approaches the best  achievable by any policy in the comparison class. Most importantly,  these results depend on the size of the comparison class, but not  on the size of the state space.

  abstract = {In the framework of queuing theory with multiclass jobs, trunk-reservation is an admission control technique to handle job class priority in an online fashion, and serve as many high priority jobs as possible. This is achieved by rejecting jobs with sufficiently low priority when the buffer space becomes a scarce resource, i.e., when the queue may soon overflow. Mathematically, the objective is to maximize the long-term reward of the admitted jobs, where each job is assigned a reward which is monotonic with respect to the priority class it belongs to. In this paper we study online learning of optimal trunk-reservation policies when the system parameters, i.e., class arrival rates and service time, are unknown. Starting from a Markov Decision Process (MDP) formulation, we leverage the stairway structure of the optimal policy to define Integer Gradient Ascent (IGA), a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm based on policy-gradient methods, specifically tailored to the mathematical properties of the problem at hand. We provide theoretical results on the convergence properties of IGA. Extensive numerical experiments characterize its behavior and confirm that it outperforms standard RL techniques in terms of convergence rate.},

Call admission control (CAC) is an essential component of such systems. For most practical systems it is prohibitively difficult to compute the optimal CAC policy that optimizes certain performance metrics because of the 'curse of dimensionality'. In this paper we study two families of structured CAC policies: threshold and reservation policies. These policies are easy to implement and have good performance in practice. However, since the number of structured policies grows exponentially with the number of call classes and the capacity of the system, finding the optimal structured policies is a complex unsolved problem. In this paper efficient search algorithms are proposed to find the coordinate optimal structured policies among all structured policies. Through extensive numerical experiments we show that the search algorithms converge quickly and work for systems with large capacity and many call classes. In addition, the returned structured policies have optimal or near-optimal performance, and outperform those structured policies with parameters chosen based on simple heuristics.},

We present an explicit counterexample to this style of argument. Therefore, we suggest that the Theorem 2 in (Abbasi-Yadkori and Szepesvari 2015) be instead considered a conjecture, as it has no rigorous proof. - Present pragmatic approaches to apply PSRL in infinite horizon problems.

We show that the optimal value function has a specific structure, which enables us to solve the hybrid MDP exactly. Moreover, we prove that as the time step is reduced, the discrete time solution approaches the optimal solution to the original continuous time problem.

Furthermore, we provide a novel analysis of the {\textbackslash}texttt\{{\textbackslash}textsc\{KL-Ucrl\}\} algorithm establishing a high-probability regret bound scaling as  {\texttildelow}({$S\sums$},{$a\mathbf{V}\stars$},{$aT$}------------{\textsurd})O{\textasciitilde}(S{$\sum$}s,aVs,a{$\star$}T){\textbackslash}widetilde \{{\textbackslash}mathcal O\}{\textbackslash}Bigl(\{{\textbackslash}textstyle {\textbackslash}sqrt\{S{\textbackslash}sum\_\{s,a\}\{{\textbackslash}bf V\}{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}star\_\{s,a\}T\}\}{\textbackslash}Big) for this algorithm for ergodic MDPs, where {$S$}SS denotes the number of states and  where {$\mathbf{V}\stars$},{$a$}Vs,a{$\star$}\{{\textbackslash}bf V\}{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}star\_\{s,a\} is the variance of the bias function with respect to the next-state distribution following action {$a$}aa in state {$s$}ss.  The resulting bound improves upon the best previously known regret bound {\textbackslash}Ocal{\texttildelow}({$DSAT$}---{\textsurd}){\textbackslash}Ocal{\textasciitilde}(DSAT){\textbackslash}widetilde \{{\textbackslash}Ocal\}(DS{\textbackslash}sqrt\{AT\}) for that algorithm, where {$A$}AA and {$D$}DD respectively denote  the maximum number of actions (per state) and the diameter of MDP. We finally compare the leading terms of the two bounds in some benchmark MDPs indicating  that the derived bound can provide an order of magnitude improvement in some cases. Our analysis leverages novel variations of the transportation lemma  combined with Kullback-Leibler concentration inequalities, that we believe to be of independent interest.},

We propose a new algorithm UCRL2-VTR, which can be seen as an extension of the UCRL2 algorithm with linear function approximation. We show that UCRL2-VTR with Bernstein-type bonus can achieve a regret of {$O$}{\~}~({$dDT$}----{\textsurd})O{\textasciitilde}(dDT){\textbackslash}tilde\{O\}(d{\textbackslash}sqrt\{DT\}), where {$d$}dd is the dimension of the feature mapping, {$T$}TT is the horizon, and {$D$}DD is the diameter of the MDP.

  abstract = {As clean energy vehicles, electric vehicles (EVs) have been paid unprecedented attention in dealing with serious energy crises and heavy tailpipe emission in recent years. Due to its limited battery range and long charging time, it's significant to reasonably determine the locations and capacities of EV charging infrastructure. There are two research gaps in existing researches: unrealistically assuming the infinite queuing length based on the M/M/1 or M/M/S queuing model and lacking the research on variable quantities of chargers allocated at different charging stations. To fill up these gaps, we propose an optimal location model to determine the optimal locations and capacities of EV charging infrastructure to minimize the comprehensive total cost, which considers the charging queuing behavior with finite queue length and various siting constrains. And the results show that (1) the proposed model has a good performance in determining the optimal locations and capacities of EV charging infrastructure (i.e. the optimal locations of charging stations, the optimal quantities of chargers installed at each charging station, the optimal allowable maximum queue length and maximum capacity of each charging station); (2) the quantity of chargers and allowable maximum queue length at each charging station are consistent with the distribution densities of existing charging stations at these locations; (3) the two parameters of unit value of time and unit distance cost have a more significant impact on the total cost. Therefore, the total cost can be effectively reduced by appropriately increasing the quantity of chargers at each charging station and the distribution density of charging stations.},

Algorithms and theory that provide strong problem-dependent bounds could help illuminate the key features of what makes a RL problem hard and reduce the barrier to using RL algorithms in practice. As a step towards this we derive an algorithm and analysis for finite horizon discrete MDPs with state-of-the-art worst-case regret bounds and substantially tighter bounds if the RL environment has special features but without apriori knowledge of the environment from the algorithm. As a result of our analysis, we also help address an open learning theory question~{\textbackslash}cite\{jiang2018open\} about episodic MDPs with a constant upper-bound on the sum of rewards, providing a regret bound function of the number of episodes with no dependence on the horizon.},

  abstract = {For better service provision and utilization of renewable energy, Internet service providers have already built their data centers in geographically distributed locations. These companies balance quality of service (QoS) revenue and power consumption by migrating virtual machines (VMs) and allocating the resource of servers adaptively. However, existing approaches model the QoS revenue by service-level agreement (SLA) violation, and ignore the network communication cost and immigration time. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning-based adaptive resource management algorithm, which aims to get the balance between QoS revenue and power consumption. Our algorithm does not need to assume prior distribution of resource requirements, and is robust in actual workload. It outperforms other existing approaches in three aspects: (1) The QoS revenue is directly modeled by differentiated revenue of different tasks, instead of using SLA violation. (2) For geodistributed data centers, the time spent on VM migration and network communication cost are taken into consideration. (3) The information storage and random action selection of reinforcement learning algorithms are optimized for rapid decision making. Experiments show that our proposed algorithm is more robust than the existing algorithms. Besides, the power consumption of our algorithm is around 13.3\% and 9.6\% better than the existing algorithms in non-differentiated and differentiated services.},
